    "## Feedback from Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This section details the incorporation of Assignment 1 feedback regarding the project's novelty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feedback:** \"Novelty: where is your methodology?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorporation:** This feedback highlighted the need to articulate the unique methodological approach. The project's novelty lies not just in the problem but in its **integrated, multi-data source, and advanced analytical methodology** for comprehensively tackling 'brain rot' beyond simple correlations. The current demonstration serves as a foundational step for this broader, novel approach, strengthening the project's unique value proposition through a clear methodological framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Characterising and Analysing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This section details the data pertinent to \"The Unspoken Epidemic,\" outlining sources, characteristics, analysis methods, and a practical demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Potential Data Sources and Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing 'brain rot' comprehensively requires diverse data, from individual experiences to macro trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Primary Data (Surveys):** Self-reported data on social media usage, academic performance, sleep, and mental health (as used in this demonstration). Questions adapted from validated scales (e.g., Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale).\n",
    "    * **Pros:** Directly addresses specific research questions; captures subjective experiences.\n",
    "    * **Cons:** Prone to self-report bias, recall issues, social desirability bias; limited for objective behavior or long-term trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Secondary Data (for Future Expansion & Broader Trends):** Mobile engagement trends (Shorts/Reels), reading trends (average book length), Wikipedia dwell time data, neuroscience data, CommonCrawl/Google Books Ngrams Viewer, and academic score trends. These data types offer objective evidence and broader trend analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Characteristics (The 4 V's):**\n",
    "    The characteristics of big data are commonly described by the \"4 V's\":\n",
    "    * **Volume:** Current project is small. Future expansion involves **petabytes**, requiring scalable storage.\n",
    "    * **Variety:** Current data is structured. Future expansion introduces **high variety**: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured (text, video, neuroimages).\n",
    "    * **Velocity:** Current data is static. Future social media engagement data would be **high velocity**, necessitating real-time processing.\n",
    "    * **Veracity:** Current self-reported data is subject to biases. Future data from APIs or web crawls may contain noise; rigorous validation and cleaning are critical (Marr, n.d.).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Platforms, Software, and Tools:**\n",
    "    * **Current Project:** R (analysis, modeling), RStudio, local storage, CSV.\n",
    "    * **Future Expansion:** Cloud object storage (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage), NoSQL databases (MongoDB), Data Warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery) for storage. Distributed computing frameworks (Apache Spark, Hadoop); cloud services (AWS Glue, Google Dataflow) for processing. Python (advanced ML, NLP, deep learning), specialized visualization (Tableau), workflow orchestration (Apache Airflow) for tools. These provide scalability, flexibility, and robust processing for diverse, large-scale, high-velocity data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Data Analysis Techniques and Statistical Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines broader analytical methods applicable to the project, with rationale and expected outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Descriptive Statistics & Visualization:** Methods include means, medians, distributions, time-series plots. Rationale: Summarize data, identify patterns and trends (e.g., usage, book length changes). Expected Outcomes: Baseline understanding of current patterns.\n",
    "* **Inferential Statistics:** Methods such as T-tests, ANOVA (comparing group means), Chi-squared tests (categorical associations), Multiple Regression Analysis, Confidence Interval Tests, and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) (Selection of Appropriate Statistical Methods for Data Analysis, n.d.). Rationale: Draw statistically sound conclusions, testing hypotheses. Multiple regression assesses simultaneous impact of multiple predictors, VIF diagnoses multicollinearity, and confidence intervals provide plausible ranges for population parameters. Expected Outcomes: Confirm significant differences or associations; understand independent effects of variables; ensure model robustness.\n",
    "* **Time-Series Analysis:** Methods include ARIMA models, Prophet. Rationale: Analyze trends over time (e.g., usage, book lengths) for 'brain rot' onset and progression. Expected Outcomes: Detection of temporal patterns, forecasting.\n",
    "* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Methods like N-gram analysis, readability scores (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid) (DataCamp, n.d.). Rationale: Quantitatively assess linguistic simplification in text corpora. Expected Outcomes: Statistical evidence of trends in linguistic complexity.\n",
    "* **Machine Learning for Prediction:** Methods including Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Decision Trees/Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines (Machine Learning for Social Science, n.d.). Rationale: Build predictive models to identify 'brain rot' drivers and outcomes. Expected Outcomes: Predict academic impact, sleep, mental health; identify influential factors.\n",
    "* **Clustering (Unsupervised Learning):** Methods such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering (Machine Learning for Social Science, n.d.). Rationale: Identify natural groupings in student populations based on behavior. Expected Outcomes: Discover student profiles or 'brain rot' archetypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates the project's feasibility using a real dataset and R.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dataset Identification:** A \"Social Media Addiction and Mental Health\" dataset from Kaggle was used. It was collected via surveys (university mailing lists, social media) with validation, de-duplication, and anonymization.\n",
    "    * **Download Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships\n",
    "    * **R Markdown File:** The R Markdown file used will be uploaded to Moodle.\n",
    "* **Data Description & Features:** 645 observations, 15 variables. Key features include `Age`, `Gender`, `Academic_Level`, `Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours`, `Most_Used_Platform`, `Sleep_Hours_Per_Night`, `Mental_Health_Score`, `Affects_Academic_Performance`, `Conflicts_Over_Social_Media`, `Addicted_Score`, `Relationship_Status`, `Country`.\n",
    "* **Analysis Process (Using R):**\n",
    "    1.  **Initial Inspection:** Loaded data (`str()`, `summary()`, `head()`).\n",
    "    2.  **Cleaning & Preprocessing:** `na.omit()` removed missing data. Variables converted to factors. \"LinkedIn\" users filtered out. `Most_Used_Platform` grouped, with \"Facebook\" as reference.\n",
    "    3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations revealed initial patterns. These box plots are enhanced using hybrid box-violin plots for richer data distribution insights:\n",

    "    4.  **Statistical Modeling:** Three regression models were built: Logistic Regression for `Affects_Academic_Performance`, Linear Regression for `Sleep_Hours_Per_Night` and `Mental_Health_Score`. Predictors included `Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours`, `Academic_Level`, `Most_Used_Platform_Grouped`, `Age`, `Gender`, `Relationship_Status`, plus `Conflicts_Over_Social_Media` for mental health. VIFs confirmed no problematic multicollinearity.\n",

    "\n",
    "Data governance ensures integrity, security, and ethical use; data management executes policies (Information Governance Services, 2023).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Accessibility:**\n",
    "    * **Current Project:** Uses a public, anonymized Kaggle dataset, promoting transparency.\n",

    "    * **Self-Reported Bias:** Acknowledged limitation of the current dataset (cross-sectional, online recruitment bias).\n",
    "    * **Privacy & Confidentiality (Future Data):** Crucial to obtain explicit informed consent for new individual-level data.\n",
    "    * **Potential for Misinterpretation/Stigmatization:** Findings must be presented with nuance, emphasizing correlation over causation to avoid unfair generalizations. Statistical associations are not causal claims.\n",
