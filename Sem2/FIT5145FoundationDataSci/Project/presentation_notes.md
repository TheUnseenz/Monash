# Intro
## Slide 1 
Hi, I'm Adrian, and today I will be presenting on the unspoken epidemic - the rise of brain rot
What's brain rot?

## Slide 2
Brain rot is when you spend too much time watching short form content, 
usually short-form videos like Tiktok videos, Instagram reels, Youtube shorts on social media.

Watching too much of these stunts your focus, mental performance and well being
It's linked with more depression, reduced productivity, reduced focus, etc.
I want to put some more concrete numbers to these.

## Slide 3
For now, the data analysed is just a small survey on social media usage of 600-ish responses. If this project is upscaled, it has the potential to be a massive data science project.
Let's look at the analysis.

## Slide 4/5
How does social media usage relate to academic performance impact?
So first things first, this means how much more likely they said "social media affected my academic performance" on the survey. Not their actual marks.

We see that spending more time on social media is a very strong link (it's actually 7x per hour)

Also, 
Not all social media platforms are the same.
Tiktok, snapchat, instagram users are affected the most at 129x, 23x, 18x more likely to have their academic performance impacted.
Facebook is used as a baseline, because it's apparently the least impactful. Twitter and youtube users aren't meaningfully impacted.

## Slide 6/7
What about impact on sleep hours?
Using more social media is again strongly linked to less sleep (-0.76 hours).

This time, it is youtube, snapchat and tiktok users who sleep less at -0.95, -0.79, -0.35 hours of sleep.
Facebook users again are the healthiest users here. The rest weren't a meaningful factor.

## Slide 8/9
Lastly, what about mental health score? 
Yet again, more time on social media is a strong link at -0.24 per hour. 
Interestingly, conflicts over social media is the strongest link of all at -0.79 score.
So, if you see keyboard warriors, have some pity for them.

Snapchat, youtube, instagram users had the worst mental health scores at -0.36, -0.32, -0.15 score than Facebook. 
Twitter users actually scored better than Facebook for once. 
This is notable because twitter can be described to be short-form content, but in text format instead of videos unlike tiktok.
It shows that not all content consumption is the same.

But overall, social media use isn't that big an impact on mental health score.

## Slide 10
In conclusion, we do in fact see a significant and meaningful impact from the usage of social media. 
The type of content matters, hence the differences between users of various platforms. 
This also suggests why youtube users have such a wide variance in their data - youtube can be used for much more than brain rot.

Finally, I want to emphasize again that this study only shows correlation, not causation.
