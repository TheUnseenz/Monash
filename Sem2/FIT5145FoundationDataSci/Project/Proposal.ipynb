    "The world's population is increasingly being online today, especially in the recent post-pandemic years. A concerning trend is arising: short-form, low quality but addictive content, usually on social media, is exploding in popularity. Some examples of this would be the massive growth in popularity of TikTok - 1.925 billion users since its launch in 2018 [7], Instagram Reels and Youtube Short's - 90 billion viewed videos in 2024 compared to 30 billion in 2021 [1], but video content has also been shortening in length in general. Social media, where brain rot content is typically found, has grown by an absurd 2.52x in the last 10 years, putting it at 5.24 billion people now - a solid majority of the world [6]. This phenomenon has come to be dubbed as \"brain rot\" [2]. It should be noted that while the pandemic lockdowns certainly excarbated it, this trend was already starting to rise even before that. With how our behaviours shape us, it is crucial to understand its impact, as research already shows a multitude of negative effects: shortened attention spans, reinforcement of existing viewpoints, dampened critical thinking, worsened academic anxiety, academic engagement and mindfulness, and causes depression - and this list is non-exhaustive. While there are many blogs and articles offering advice on how to deal with \"brain rot\", for example [8][9], there is a lack of hard research to validate these.

    "    Analysis about the business/application area the project sits in:\n",
    "        Think broadly about the ecosystem in which \"brain rot\" exists. This isn't necessarily a single business, but rather a confluence of industries and societal trends. You could discuss:\n",
    "            The attention economy: This is a key area. Platforms (social media, video streaming, etc.) are businesses that thrive on capturing and retaining user attention. The rise of \"brain rot\" content is arguably a consequence of optimizing for engagement within this economy.\n",
    "            The education sector: \"Brain rot\" content potentially impacts learning, academic performance, and the effectiveness of educational tools.\n",
    "            The mental health industry: Increased exposure to low-quality, addictive content could contribute to issues like anxiety, depression, and reduced attention spans, creating a demand for mental health services.\n",
    "            The content creation industry: While some creators contribute to \"brain rot,\" others are trying to create high-quality, engaging content. Understanding the dynamics could inform better content strategies.\n",
    "            Society as a whole: This is the broadest application area. The well-being, productivity, and informed decision-making of the population are all affected.\n",
    "    What kind of benefits or values the project can create for the specific business area?\n",
    "        Even if your project isn't directly generating profit, it can provide significant value:\n",
    "            Informing platform design and content moderation: Understanding the mechanisms and impact of \"brain rot\" can help platforms develop strategies to promote healthier content consumption and mitigate negative effects. This could lead to increased user well-being and potentially long-term platform sustainability.\n",
    "            Guiding educational strategies: Insights from your research could inform educators on how to address the challenges posed by \"brain rot\" and develop strategies to maintain student engagement and focus.\n",
    "            Raising awareness and informing public discourse: Your research can contribute to a better understanding of the issue, leading to more informed discussions among policymakers, parents, and the public. This could influence policy changes or public health initiatives.\n",
    "            Identifying opportunities for responsible content creation: Understanding what makes content addictive but low-quality could help creators develop strategies for creating engaging and valuable content.\n",
    "            Potentially informing mental health interventions: If links are found between \"brain rot\" and mental health issues, this could inform the development of targeted interventions or preventative measures.\n",
    "    Who are the primary stakeholders and how will they benefit from the project?\n",
    "        Users of online platforms: They would benefit from a healthier online environment, improved focus, and potentially better mental well-being.\n",
    "        Educational institutions and educators: They would benefit from insights on how to combat the negative impacts of \"brain rot\" on learning and student engagement.\n",
    "        Parents and caregivers: They would gain a better understanding of the risks and potential solutions related to their children's online consumption.\n",
    "        Policymakers and regulators: Your research could inform decisions about content regulation, platform accountability, and public health initiatives related to digital well-being.\n",
    "        Online platforms (potentially): While they might initially see this as critical, in the long run, addressing \"brain rot\" could lead to more sustainable user engagement and a better reputation.\n",

    "        Platform initiatives: Some platforms are implementing features like \"digital well-being\" dashboards, reminders to take breaks, and content filtering options. Research these initiatives and their effectiveness.\n",
    "        Educational programs: Some schools and organizations are developing media literacy programs to help individuals critically evaluate online content and manage their screen time.\n",
    "        Mental health campaigns: There are campaigns promoting responsible social media use and raising awareness about the potential negative impacts of excessive screen time.\n",
    "        Research on attention spans and media consumption: Cite academic studies that have already investigated the effects of fast-paced content on attention and cognitive function.\n",
