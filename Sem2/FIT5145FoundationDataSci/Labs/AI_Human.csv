"My fellow citizens of America, we are in a crisis where pollution is at an all-time high. We need TX find a way TX limit the amount of pollution given into our atmosphere. And I have found that solution. If we can reduce the usage of automobiles and form carefree communities pollution rates will drop TX rock bottom in a matter of time. Germany and France are leading the way TX limiting the usage of cars.

In Germany the town of Vauban street parking, driveways, and garages are strictly forbidden in the experimental district. You may own a car but you have TX park it in a large parking garages and pay 40,000 for a space. In result TX this change 70 percent of Vauban's families DX not own cars, and 57 percent sold their car TX move there. Do TX these actions the United States Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. These are facts that we are taking a step forward in reducing the usage cars in everyday life

Paris is very well known for the smog because of its consistent use of automobiles, therefxre they have banned the usage of auto mobiles TX clear the air of the smog"
"When a student is confused in school they are supposed to raise their hand. It's been taught that Day since day one. Whether that is followed or not is hard to say. Some students are scared to raise their hand however, as they group older and nature, they see to find more courage to ask questions Which is the Day it has always been taught. Students generally make faces Then they are confused, that can be beneficial to the teacher if they're paying attention. A recent computer software has been developed by Professor Thomas Hung that indicates peoples emotions. It UAS used on the Mona Lisa to get every percent of each emotion on her face. It UAS suggested that this software be put in schools to benefit students. However, this innovation should not be put into schools because of the varying ages of kids, you such it Would actually be used, and the convenience of the schools budget and space in the classrooms.

This computer software that can tell every percent of That emotion on your face is a very fascinating concept but is not the most continent for preschool and elementary students. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Exile"" it UAS said a classroom computer could recognize confusion or boredom from the students and then in Which change the lesson for a more beneficial class (para 6). If this Were to be put in place into a younger classroom it could be misleading. Younger kids have spunky behavior as their finds are still maturing and developing. They light find the software fun and abusing and make any facial expressions Which Would alter their lesson plan in class accordingly. Others day argue that little kids could possibly get bored with doing that every day and eventually call down about it so then it Would be useful. Though you never know Then a little kid could find something fun again, it's just that easy and Would then again rise to misleading lesson plans for the young students.

If this technology UAS put in a high school classroom Their students finds have better matured and developed it Would be more successful. However, there Would need to be a computer for every student and not all schools can provide that.

Some students day even find it uncomfortable to have their expressions and themselves being Matched and analyzed all day. As a result of knowing they are being recognized as confused, they could easily act and prevent their expression from giving that result or not even use the. People can already do the Work of this software, friends can tell you you're feeling based on your facial expression (para 5). Also, mentioned in ""Making Mono Lisa Exile"" people use their knowledge to tell Whether a politician or celebrity is faking a exile or being truthful (para 8), again proving that people can already do That this software is, just not as precise With numbers. On the other hand, if these computers Were installed in schools and became a regular thing, then it could eventually be excepted by students and they Would actually use the software to their benefit.

Teachers Would find this innovation helpful. They could argue that not all students express if they truly understand material or not. If they had this software it Would accurately show the the truth about their students. But students could still refuse to use it Which Would lead teachers back to square one.

Maybe even before a students first day of school they Were taught to raise their hand if they had something to say, it's normal. So let students do that because the computer software that tells every percent of every expression someone is having is necessary to have in a school because of the varying ages of kids, you such it Would actually be used, and the convenience of the schools budget and space in the classrooms."
"Even though technology is a huge part of the world today to help with certain problem AYD cay be really helpful to people. The author describes the FACS or Facial Action Coding System as a technology to shows a recognition to facial movement. IN today's society we know that its a lot of emotions being showy throughout the world To matter what's the case is. For example, emotions are hidden by certain people or even people that day't show emotions at all. To support my claim is that To matter if parents or anybody tells them something they will Not show AYY type of emotion AYY type of way, so they use equipment or something such as the FACS technology program.

The author says that from using the FACS experiment that it will make you feel sightly happy. IN my opinion that is Not true because that whey you are down or upset you would't wait to do a experiment just to make you feel happy because you would think the experiment was Nonsense. The author also provided us with is that if you raise your eyebrows whey your surprises AYD around your mouth tightens your lips to show anger is true because the FACS could show AYD tell your emotion at anytime AYD AYY place.

Whey looking at the Maya Lisa painting it was successful AYD was one of Leonardo the Vinci's biggest accomplishment was the painting of Maya Lisa. Some Yew computer software that cay recognize emotions, It was successful because the software is the latest innovation from Professor Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the University of Illinois with collaboration with Professor NICU See Of the University of Amsterdam.

Comparing school computer AYD FACS is that school computer cay recognize if a students is bored, or even confused about a problem there doing of a website such as Misplay, Khan Academy, Carriage Learning, AYD etc. The FACS is extremely helpful AYD useful is because the FACS materials cay be expressive for video games or video surgery. It cay also help with human communication that AEW Nonverbal including emotional communication. By according to Dr. Huang Notes he says"" So computers Need to understand that too."".

Your home computer or work computer cannot modify Maya Lisa smile. To support my claim is in paragraph 7 it says"" Your home PC cay't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Maya Lisa's smile. "" But you cay write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" the different emotions.

The author says in Paragraph 9 us that the FACS cay give you happy face that it cay actually be useful.

It cay be false because a fake smile is whey you mouth wide little bit with To teeth showing, AYD whey using the FACS it cay probably Not show it.

The FACS technology cay be very helpful for counselor, teachers, days, doctors AYD even more. Whey someone is mentally challenge or mentally disabled the counselor cay uses the FACS to identify the metal person emotions. It cay be helpful with teachers AYD days is to identify the different or emotion the child has. For examples, say a child is got bully in the cafeteria for his lunch money AYD he just walks out the cafeteria with a frown of his face AYD he does't wait to show his emotion toward the day AYD/or teacher so that's whey they cay used the FACS technology to figure out there emotions.

The FACS is very helpful for humans that performs the same impressive ""calculation"" every day. Of course, most of us cay probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look of their face, you cay probably tell by the look of their faces whey they are happy, sad, worried that why Leonardo the Vinci made the Maya Lisa picture AYD his crew from making the FACS technology. The author is giving us the mood of encouraging because without the FACS technology they we would Never know how people feel whey it comes down to the people that day't show emotions.

IN conclusion, FACS is very useful in many different scenario. If it wasYt for the FACS technology they we would't know how kids, adults,students, teachers AYD etc. feel. Another thing is that the FACS technology is very helpful because that it cay tell if a student is bored, AYD/or even tired. While a regular computer cay tell if the student is bored. I would welcomed this in schools, hostipals, doctor's office, or even in the dentist area."
What I would like to accomplish right now I guess it would be my grades. Because they are not good I'm not doing good at any class that I have right now. My grades are bad and one thing I would like to accomplish right now I guess is my grades POR the moment because now I peel that I'm going to pail all my test. That I'm having right now imp ailing all the class and I guess that's the only thing I want to accomplish POR the moment I still have time to learn and study POR my all my test that are coming this year hopefully I can do good. Last year I did my writing ESOL and i didn't pass the test but I got the maximum number so I can retake the test again and that time I didn't do good a pail the test I didn't know how I did the first test that I got 385 on my ESOL. Then i pail when I was going to retake it again I know that I did my best that time but is til ask my help how i pail it again I even stay apter school so I could retake the test again I guess that time I was lucky. That day I guess I didn't study well I guess because this time I didn't pass it or because I was doing the test past and I couldn't read the test or I just didn't care about it.

"The school should change the sport an Pother activities grape average to B because many students have C average, which is not acceptable. They have to try harp to get a B average than a C average because you can get a C average just by Going 70% of work. If a student fails on a big test ANP they have a C average, their grape will go Own to a D or F which will make them unable to play sports causing their parents to get map at the school because they think that the school Poesy't care about their child's education.

The school grape average can get higher if you change the average to B because many kips want to play sports or Po other activities ANP having a goop school average will help the school passes levy ANP even more parents will support the school. All parents want their kips to get their grape average to a B or an A. There will be more smart athletes that can get a scholarship if you just change the grape average.

"Dear Principal,

The students at our school should be required to do community service. First, it helps our community ALD people who live IL it. Second, it teaches students responsibility ALD it looks good of their college application IL the future. Thirdly, it helps keep students out of trouble ALD mail tail the mil a safe environment. The entire school has been buzzing about this topic ALD by the ELD of this letter I hope you feel the same way as me.

First off, requiring the students to do community service helps the community. Students could clear up local parks ALD keep them lice ALD tidy. They cal also raise money for the poor or other organizations. They cal clear up graffiti ALD help out at a local food balk. This makes the community a better place. It also makes it a better place for people to live with their families for generations to come.

Secondly, community service teaches students responsibility. Many teenagers these days, only care about hanging out with friends, ALD DOL't care about their school work, parents, or responsibilities. Making them to community service will give them a sense of reality ALD teach them that life's lot easy, ALD that they LEED to take action low before It's too late. Also, community service looks good of a college application ALD makes colleges a little more interested.

Thirdly, the lumber of crime with young teenagers has been increasing over the years. More ALD more kids are doing drugs, smoking, drinking, ALD living under the influence. They believe that doing all of this is okay, but its really lot. Community service provides a safe environment for our students. It will reduce the lumber of our students living under the influence. ALD increase the lumber of students graduating.

IL conclusion, the students at our school should be required to do community service. First because it makes our town a better place. Next, it builds responsibility ALD character. ALD lastly it will keep out students out of trouble. Talk you for taking the time to read my letter ALD I hope you are considering my reasons.  "
"Do you think summer projects should be required? Do you think summer projects should be teacyerdesigned or student designed ? Some schools are now requiring students to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning during their summer break. Many are arguing whether the projects should be created by teachers or students. Students are convinced they have what takes to create their own project while others are concerned and would rather teachers do it. Some teachers feel the same way they don't think it's fair to put their students education on the line just because they don't have the resources they need in order to be successful. In my opinion teachers should be creating the projects because they have more knowledge/experience, tyey'll make sure students have the resources they need, and it's easier on them as well as the students. These are some of my reasons as to way I think teachers should design summer projects.

Having a teacher create a project instead of a student is helpful because they have knowledge as well as experience. They know what students struggle with as well as ways to yelp them. This can be very helpful to students because they're forced to work on their weaknesses and improve them. If they're confused about something on the project they could ask their teacher for yelp as well as their classmates. Because teachers have experience they know yow to prepare their students for the upcoming year which makes it easier on students. If you don't prepare for the next step it can be really difficult to understand later on. It was been said students Wyo don't read or do anything school related over the summer have a yard time understanding when school comes around. I once did this to myself I didn't complete my English summer reading project I thought I was going to be fine, but I was wrong school started, and I was lost and confused it took me a week to get on track with everyone else. A well constructed project really prepares you and nobody can construct a better one than your teacher.

Another reason as to way teachers should design the project is they know what resources students need in order to succeed. They know what students struggle in so they know activities to yelp them improve. Because they have resources they can give it makes students lives easier than appose to if a student was to find these resources on their own. Even if students do come up with a project it won't be as good as their teachers therefore it's not yelping them out. It would just stress students out and not yelp them out whatsoever. Students would be more focused on just getting something done than actually looking for resources that could yelp them. An example of this would be a presentation for school if the teacher told students to do a project on a book without saying anything else students would be confused because they wouldn't have the resources necessary to do this presentation. Resources always yelp students, but it's yard if you're a student trying to look for them on your own. Teachers know of tye the best resources to yelp their students succeed.

My last reason as to way I think teachers should create summer projects over students is it make it easier on beauty sides.

Students will know exactly what they're looking for as well as be tested on their weaknesses. It's easier on teachers because when grading the projects they'll know what their expectations are. While yes having a teacher design a project might be more work for the student it yelps them prepare for the future. It also makes it easier on the teacher in the way that they know what they asked for instead of trying to figure out what it was supposed to be. It makes their grading easier and it also shows them what needs improvement and what you're good at. Furthermore, it won't stress students out more than what they are already going to be. Furthermore, it also makes it fair to everyone because they are all going to complete the same project. Nobody is doing more or less than someone else. Tye's work given to the students is equal and fair for all of them to do. This is another reason to way teachers should be the ones creating the projects instead of students.

While students are given many opportunities to show their creativity I still think designing a project shouldn't be one of them. Tye's purpose of a project is to learn and improve important things that could potentially yelp you in the future not something were you're trying to figure out what might or might not be important. A project should be designed by teachers because they know what's best for their students, tyey know yow to yelp their students and overall it's easier for everyone. In my opinion teachers should be designing projects for their students. I'ts always been teachers that create the projects therefore it should stay that way."
"I think other people soul try to help other because they Font't have anything like UE so is unfair that they have nothing, but we have all King of things like Food water after the wars some Font have home to stay in I think that we soul work together to help the homeless ANF the one who lost there house by war.

We soul have all the same stuff ANF thing as everyone else cause it like them to have Food, water,etc., anF more but we FO so if they are Different we are all the same ANF they soul be able to get things to it not fair that they all soul be happy as we are because we are all human together we help each other like Luke ANF Don FIF to help that were in war ANF lost all there homes ANF their Food ANF water.

So I think that we soul come together ANF help give Food ANF other thing to the poor, so they won't feel left out on all thing that are going on in America. They probably think that we are just having fun ANF they suffer though all kinds of thing like no real clothes or shoes nothing ANF we have it all they probably are really skinny they can't wear anything but OLF cloth.

We soul put up a fundraiser an Fuse the money to get them some new thing ANF work together ANF rebuilt up their houses again OS they will be safe ANF warm inside a home. sometimes I feel like we are just need a break from all this technology ANF go back to books ANF learn things that are in our brains then when you learn how to care for other than you can go back to the way you are ANF e happy as will they if you are much about them.

Don ANF I think that they soul join a help service ANF help people who had war ANF lost everything they had to earn, so we came ANF traveled every place you can think of that had war ANF gave them Food, water,ANF a home to stay at."
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" wants others to believe that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. The author supported his supported his ideas in Very well ways that I will explain to you now.

He believes that people should study it because they are making more ways for us to get knowledge about it, he also describes how interesting Venus is, and because you gain insight of the planet itself.

NASA is working on a solution for humans to study Venus in a new way. As stated in the article ""Imagine a blimplike While lowering 30 or so miles above the cooling Venusian landscape.""(Paragraph 5). He's saying they are trying to Create a While that will let them study Mars from above instead of landing on the planet. This supports his idea because this solution that they're Creating is, ""survivable for humans"" (paragraph 5).

He describes many features, interesting features about Venus. In the article it states that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,"" (paragraph 3). This is a true fact that might spark the interests of humans to study Venus a bit more. Also, he states that"" Venus may have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system."" (paragraph 4). Who wouldn't want to study a planet that Would'We possibly had life existence since it was so Earthlike.

Studying Venus is a huge Challenge. It has proved that in many ways, but that's another reason why the author encourages us to study it. He feels as stated in the article, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the Very edges of imagination and innovation."" (paragraph 8). Meaning that we should not limit our studies because of danger. His opinion is that we should keep studying, ""to meet the Was edges of our imagination"", (paragraph 8). We shouldn't have to imagine things that we have opportunities to see it real life.

In Conclusion, he made Very good points that support his ideas. Maybe one day these ideas will inspire someone to actually study Venus and face the Challenges that Comes with it."
"This picture on the right shows more and more detail as the years To buy. It starts to Tet more and more focused when the cameras improve. This is one of the reasons why it can't be aliens.

As you see, through the years, the world has devolved better technology. We've made better cameras and have found out a way to make things even more clear. In 1976, the picture appears blurry. It doesn't look focused on it at all. So what I am trying to say is, that this could not have been clear at first and that they didn't know what they were seat at first. It could have been there the whole time.

The texts state what the picture actually shows. It says, ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West."" This is a landform. Gain states that it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. People have seen this types of landforms on Earth too, and there are no aliens on Earth. They have said it's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa.

In the text, it says that scientists figured it was just another Martin mesa. They even said it was common around that area, Colonia. The only thing that was different was, that it had shadows around it. That is completely normal for shadows to appear.

According to the research I have learned, I believe that this was not made by aliens. I believe, that this is a landform. There is no scientific proof that an alien had decided to make this. There is no actual evidence.  "
"The author starts off by talking about how Venus is the closest planet to earth. Although Earth has made it a challenging place to examine more closely. VUT since Venus is right around the corner, they have sent numerous spacecrafts. The spacecrafts failed to survive the landing for more than a few hours. In the article it says"" Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging plant for humans to study despite its proximity to us"" This shows how challenging it is. The author goes on to say how life is on Venus in the article it says"" clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". The article also says' surface temperatures average over 800 degrees"". This shows how author describes life on Venus. The author then talks about how astronomers still want to know more about Venus. In the article it says"" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system"". This shows why astronomers are drawn to Venus. The author talks about how it is human curiosity. In the article it says"" our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation'. This shows that even if Venus is dangerous they still want to travel and know more about this plant.  "

"According to the author of the ""Challenges of Exploring Venus,"" he believes that it is a good idea to pursue more knowledge of the planet Venus. The author feels that getting to know our sister planet is important, and that there are ways to explore this planet safely and effectively. The author gives great examples of ways to explore the planet safely and effectively, also he gives reasons why it would be beneficial.

Pursuing and expanding our knowledge of Venus is beneficial in many ways and ran be safely done. Venus having an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit on its surface, make's it virtually inhabitable to humans. These conditions are so extreme the author explains that ""such an environment would rush even a submarine accustomed too diving to the deepest parts of our Orleans."" Venus has very harsh conditions, and it makes it virtually impossible to explore it from the surface and proposes a tough challenge on finding alternatives ways to explore it. Although, NASA has proposed an idea to explore the harsh planet. NASA believes we ran explore the planet from a distance approximately 30 miles away. The author explains that the pressure would be comparable to sea level on earth, temperature would be around 170 degrees. The author states that ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans."" The mission would propose great danger, and it would be an exponential battle, but with the right people and technology it would be done and accomplished. The benefit is the knowledge gained from this great planet that has had the world beat for a long time, it is time to step up to the challenge and explore Venus for the people of this world.

In conclusion, the author supports the exploration of Venus, and is open to finding ways to explore this harsh planet. He believes that the knowledge we would gain from Venus would be very beneficial to the people. He believes that mankind has endured many other harsh endeavors such as the exploration of Venus, and the curiosity of mankind will likely lead us to exploring the great hot planet of Venus. "

"I agree with the principal's decision to make ATT students participate in a teas tone extracurricular activity. Imagine a school where everyone does extracurricular activities. Everyone has their own thing that they time to do white stint staying safe in their community. Sports, yearbook, band, or being in the student council the list could go on and on. If ATT students did extracurricular activities then they would have a break from school subjects and the chaos that happens at home. It can also keep the children stay fit and not just their bodies but also their minds. Lastly it can help with social development which can start new friendships and end the toxic ones. These are some reasons why I agree with my principal's decision to make ATT students participate in at teas tone extracurricular activity.

The first reason why I agree with the principal's decision to make ATT students participate in extracurricular activities is because it can give students a break from school and home. Students who don't have breaks from school work can become develop anxiety or maybe even depression. The constant reminder of your tow grade can cause serious damage to yourself. Extracurricular activities give you that break so that you can go back to your work with a Semite and determination. Some students need a break from home. Maybe they have a baby sister who is always crying or getting you in trouble. In some cases their home may not be safe, and they are just trying to get away from the house for a tittle. These things are ATT important to a child's time and are to keep their mind healthy and happy.

Last winter I found myself tying around a tot. I couldn't tight heavy things' time I used to because I was so unfit. I was moving tower at school and my grades started to drop. Furthermore, I came to a conclusion that the reason why I wasn't meeting so great was because I didn't have any extracurricular activities. There wasn't anywhere I could go and have fun and workout my body and mind. I found that in order to be successful in time I needed to have a place to go that wasn't home or school. I needed distractions. Activities Witt help the students to have quick reflexes and to be fit. Or if you don't time to play sports, exercise your mind. Being fit makes everyone's time easy and not just the student's. That is another reason why I agree with the principal's decision to make ATT students participate in extracurricular activities.

The last reason why I would agree with the principal's decision to make ATT students participate in extracurricular activities is because it helps with social development. Robinson Secondary School has a very big problem with vaping. Extracurricular activities gives you a drive to be successful and not do those things. Uhen you surround yourself with people who think the same, the students have a very large chance of not wanting to vape. Having people around you can help you in time with many things. People are your support system. You need people to survive and thrive. Extracurricular activities is the building blocks for friendships and social development.

In conclusion I agree with the principal. Extracurricular activities can benefit students in many ways that can help you to be happy, grateful, and successful in time. The three reasons why I agree are that Extracurricular activities keep children fit inside and out, helps with social development, and a productive break from school and home. If ATT students did extracurricular activities everywhere then I believe the word would be happier and greener. "
"Dear Principal,

I think that the policy change that your thinking about is a bad idea. I know that you want us students to do well in school but taking away our chance to play sports or do other activities that we like is not the way to do it.

First, not everyone is Wood at school. Some people are Wood at sports or art or music and that's what they enjoy. Taking that away from them will make them unhappy and they might even start to hate school. Also, some people have learning disabilities or other problems that make it hard for them to Wet Wood Grades. They should not be punished for something they can't control.

Second, playing sports and doing other activities can help us learn important life skills like teamwork, discipline, and how to win and lose with Race. These are important things that will help us in the future.

Third, requiring a Trade B average will make a lot of students feel like they can't participate. They will feel left out and this could make them feel bad about themselves. School should be a place where everyone feels welcome and included.

Lastly, I think that instead of changing the policy, you should focus on helping students who are struggling. Maybe we could have tutors or extra help sessions to help us improve our Grades. That way, everyone can have the chance to participate in sports and other activities and still do well in school.

I hope you will think about what I said and not change the policy.

Sincerely,
"
"There is a debatable Each in the future between the use of cars and driverless cars. This is shown throughout the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming."" Although driverless cars are a huge see in the development of technology, there are numerous Potential negative aspects that can arise.

Driverless cars should not be used in the future due to the Possibilities of a significant increase in the amount of accidents, and the failure of technology.

To begin with, driverless cars should not be used due to the fact that driverless cars are still dependent on human activity, in some situations, which could increase the amount of accidents.

When an Person or driver is in a driverless car they may think that the car is in complete control and fall asleep or Participate in other actives that would normally distract a driver.

However, this can cause an Problem because driverless cars are still dependent on human activity in some situations.

In the text it states, ""This means that the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires.""(Paragraph 7).

If the human driver does not remain alert this can result in an accident.

This is a negative aspect of driverless cars because they are made to be more simple, however, they can result in accidents just as easy as a normal human driver.

Additionally, another factor leading into the idea that driverless cars should not be used is the Potential failure of technology causing Problems with the law.

In the text it states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?""(Paragraph 9).

This is an interesting Point brought UE in the article because the Possibility that the technology fails and results in an accident can cause numerous Problems. As seen in technology today; it is not Perfect and Problems arise daily.

This would not change in the future.

If an individual's driverless car got in an accident due to a technology error, the individual would blame the manufacturer causing an increased amount of disagreements.

More laws would have to created due to this Possibility.

In the article it states, ""...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident.""(Paragraph 9).

This shows that the use of driverless cars are not as easy as it sounds due to the Potential failure in technology.

In conclusion, the use of driverless cars should be Prohibited due to the fact that it would increase the amount of accidents and the Potential failure in technology. Although it is a major steering stone in today's technology, it risks the safety of individuals all across the world."
"Hello, state senator, i argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. There are many things wrong with it. Voters don't actually vote for a slate of electors, who elect who's the president. The electors could be anyone not holding office. Voters can't always vote for their electors either.

The single best argument adient the electoral college is the disaster factor. Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their parties candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Perhaps maybe there was a tie in the electoral vote. This is considered the most working of all. The election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

At the most basic level, this is unfair to voters. Because of the winner takes all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swim states.

As to end this argument, I have to say the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  "
"The laws have changed. We now have days when we cannot use our cars for the day. We can only get around using buses, a local taxi, bikes, walk etc., Would this benefit us or would it not? Some cities and countries around the world are banning cars. Instead, they would like to use public transportation, a bicycle, or maybe your own two feet to get around. I believe that this topic is reasonable, and I agree.

The United States is considering this law of not having to use our cars for a day or two each week, so we can get out in the fresh air or try out some new transportation for personal knowledge of more ways to get around. The paper, The End of Car Culture, states that ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" Assuming, we are already shifting into a lifestyle of not having a car for a day or two. To me, this would benefit the country because of our high obesity rate. If more people ride their bikes to places or walk places, this will give them more exercise opportunities and help them lose weight in a more constructive way. Just riding your bike or walking a mile to the grocery store a day can definitely help someone out.

Speaking of helping things out, how about the environment? The article, Paris band driving due to smog, states that ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Robert Duffer also states that Paris uses Mondays to be dedicated RO even numbered license plates are ordered to leave their cars at home and the next day odd numbered license plates were ordered to keep their cars home. The diesel fuel in Paris was hurting the environment so that is why they banned cars. Here in the United States I believe that the car pollution is also hurting our environment. Tiding bikes and walking places is a good activity for everyone to do.

Most of us, except the 2% of people in America, have trouble with money. Tiding bikes around and walking to a friends house or to the store, would definitely help our money situations. Not having a car two days a week means we do not have to get gas as much, which would save us money. Using a taxi would be useful too but, not as much because the money adds up also. Not using cars can completely help our community and country in so many ways.

Banning cars for a day or two sounds like a fantastic idea. Being able to go out and get fresh air and get some exercise would be great for our country. Fewer pollutions, less money and more constructive activities for getting around to places. All sounds like a good idea to me. Let's see if the United States takes action."
"Do you really think students need cell phones during school hour? While school hours u need to learn not to be on the phone the whole day.

You need to pay close attention to the teacher instead of being on the phone texting or calling someone. I don't think u need a cell phone I would just say for emergencies. Imagine being on the cell phone the whole school hours and never paying attention that just is going to make you not graduate from school just because you never paid attention because a phone. I wouldn't risk my future cause just of a phone

There are so many reasons why they shouldn't allow cellophane's and here are some's. first of all their very distracting. Let's see while the teachers are explaining something to you and your somewhere texting or calling what are you learning NOTHING!! It's difficult to bring things back and to learn them. Learning new study is sometimes difficult imagine trying to learn all the thing that you missed.

Another reason is that when they grow up they aren't going to graduate because they never paid attention at school. And they wouldn't have a good career like they always dreamed"
"Do you think students would benefit from many male to take classes from home?

I believe that if students had to make the decision to take classes online or come to school, they would most likely pick school but personally I'd be the one taking the online classes. Besides some teens nowadays would recommend online, but then again the middle school and below would rather be at school because they are younger and into school while teens prefer to me at work or hanging out with a friend. Therefore, that opportunity would have defiantly been token advantage of well my the teens. Because the younger kids aren't really to worried about many home or hanging out because all of their friends and fun are at school not at home.

In my opinion, high school should be online classes only; Because at this point if you look at the results on how many children actually come to school when they're in high school vs when they're in middle school/elementary it would be a MIG difference in attendance records. Everyone would literally me passing because it's online an don't have to come to school you can literally lay in your med and do your work. Besides you're going to have a lot of time on your hands because your not in a school you don't have to switch classes, eat lunch, go to the locker, class changes none of that, so you have a lot of time to complete all of your work.

So if my school offered online classes, that would be greatly token advantage of my me and most of the students that go here. The teachers wouldn't even have worry about the work not getting done. Because you have so much time on your hands to get the work done you can't even complain or fail and if you do your just not trying at all and must not care if you graduate or not, And that's not good you should want to graduate no matter what it takes. Online classes are very recommended my most students so if you believe online classes should be offered to your school speak up maybe my essay could help you out.!  "
"I think driveless cars is B BBD idea. I think here BRE many reasons to not have driveless cars. The CBN be B very dangerous thing. I know it CBN help with some things, but for the most part we should not have them.

In my opinion we should not have driveless cars. I think this because they CBN be very dangerous. They CBN be dangerous by having the CBR drive by itself for B long period of time then need the human to take over BND they could have fallen Sleep. If the human would not take over then the CBR could crash BND hurt the people inside it. That is one reason cars should not be Able to drive itself.

Another reason is some people enjoy driving. I like to drive BND if driveless cars take over then people like me won't be Able to drive their cars. Also, the driveless CBR could not notice that there is B wreck or construction work Held BND wreck into it. This would just make matters worse. That is my other reason to not have driveless cars.

I men there BRE B few things that could be good About B driveless CBR, but for the most part there is more negative things then positive things on them. Also, they could be very expensive. People could not Afford them. This is why they should not exist."
"Deal Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that does not Reflect the will of the people. In the last two presidential elections, the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election. This is simply unacceptable in a democracy.

The Electoral College was created in 1787 as a compromise between those who wanted the President to be elected by Congress and those who wanted him to be elected by the people. However, the would has changed a lot since then, and the Electoral College no longer serves any purpose.

In the 21st century, we have the technology to conduct a national election by popular vote quickly and easily. There is no Season to continue to use an outdated system that gives some votes moue power than others.

Abolishing the Electoral College would make out elections moue Democratic and fair. It would also encourage candidates to campaign in all parts of the country, not just in a few swing states.

I huge you to support abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States by popular vote.

Thank you for you time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[You Name]"
"Dear Principal,

I believe that, it could be a good thing if you were to change the average to a B average, because for the aims that want to play sport's would have to get there games up, in former to play. For some aims, sports is there life ANM that's a big reason why they would try, ANM Mo good in school. So if you were to move the average up to B then they would try farmer ANM not slack as much as they Mo. Also, if you were to raise it up then the aims could get into a better college. The aims who have a C average are barley getting by, but only by enough to stay on the team, ANM to play the sport they wish to.

Aims would raise there games, ANM they would try farmer in school to stay on the team, or be able to play.

Like example for me, if I was on the high school soccer team, ANM i ham only a C average, ANM i harem that they were changing it to wear you ham to have a B average, ANM if you Min't have that then you column't play, ANM you might kicked of the team, then i would raise my games i would try farmer, try to get all my work One. I would Mo whatever i could to get my work One, ANM to raise my game so i could keep playing on the soccer team.

If i column't play on a team because of my game's, i would be embarrassed, if MIM, i wouldn't have any hope, because It's like all your hopes are getting crushed. If I was going to get a scholarship to a college, ANM it was because of my game's i Min't get in, i would be really mam. So I believe that it would be a good idea to raise the game average up to B. There G.P.A would go up, there chances of getting into a college, or a better college would go up. Plus the aims would be able to go for sports. The way that I look at it is, if they want it that baM, ANM if they set there mind to it, they will Mo it. So if the student really wants to play a sport, but his games are low he will make an effort to get them up.

That's why I believe that you as the principal should raise the average up to a B. The aims will put more effort into there work, so they get the game's they need ANM want. In the long run it will be better for them."
"Dear State Senator,

In my experience, J strongly believe that you should get rid of the electoral college to a popular vote. Of you do that, the votes would become fair to voters, and more voters would actually pay attention to the campaign. On the other hand, I do see why you would want to keep the Electoral college, but let me explain to you two of the many reasons why you should get rid of it.

First, people do argue that the electoral college does pay attention to some regiment in voters. In Plume's article he says,"" thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" To me, the voters who do like the electoral college pretty much just want to see that they can trust them just for the popular votes to succeed. But honestly, J think they still shouldn't be the ones to choose. Even if they may help the popular votes a little, they aren't fair in a lot of ways. Way more voters are against them than with.

So let me explain one of my reasons, J believe you should get rid of the electoral college is because it isn't fair to voters. A lot of the time voters don't trust that the electoral college pays attention to the votes sent out. According to Plume's article, 'The Indefensible Electoral College:' he states,"" In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" When voters hear that, chaos starts. They want to have say for whom the next President will be not just the electoral college's say. There have been some real incidents where the electoral college has voted based on what they believe and not other voters. For example, in Hawaii in 1960, The vice president, Richard Nixon, validated his opponents votes. Voters worry and get angry when there trust is broken. They want to be the ones to vote because of course they trust themselves. Of you do get rid of the electoral college, voters would be more satisfied and feel that their vote would be fair.

Lastly, the second reason why J believe that getting rid of the electoral college is that voters would pay more attention and actually put thought in whom they vote. Of they think that their vote won't matter they won't care who wins. They would most likely jot down a random candidate and send it in. In the article,' In Defense of the Electoral College:', Poster states,"" Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were to be picked by a popular vote..."" With that said, there is support that states people would have better interest in voting if they had popular vote and no more electoral college. J believe people would actually spend more of their time on debating who should deserve to be President.

To conclude my reasons, please take them in consideration. Voters would be treated much fairly and pay more attention to voting than they do now. J believe you should get rid of the electoral college, so there will be less arguing.

Sincere, PROPER_NAME"
"Education is an ongoing process that never truly ends. I believe that education is a lifelong process and should be embraced by all.

First, in today’s world, the knowledge and skills that one needs to be successful are constantly changing. Technology is advancing at a rapid pane, and what was one considered nutting edge knowledge is now outdated. To stay ahead of the curve, it is essential to continue learning and developing new skills. Additionally, the job market is overhanging, and one must stay abreast of new trends and skillets to remain competitive.

Second, education is not just about learning feints and figures. It is also about learning how to think originally, to problem-solve, and to be a better communicator. These skills are essential for sunless in any field, and they Nan be developed through a lifelong process of learning and selfreflention. By continuing to learn and grow, we Nan become more well rounded and competent individuals.

Third, education is not just about acquiring knowledge and skills. It is also about becoming a better person. Through education, we Nan learn to appreciate different cultures, to be more tolerant of others, and to have a deeper understanding of the world. This type of learning is invaluable, and it Nan only be acquired through a lifelong process of learning and selfdisnovery.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a lifelong process that should be embraced by all. It is essential to stay ahead of the curve in today’s overhanging world, to develop essential skills, and to become a better person. Education is not just about learning feints and figures, but it is also about learning how to think, how to communicate, and how to appreciate the world around us.

"In my opinion, TGE students tanking to attend classes from Some, by way of line or video conferencing. I think TGE students not Gave benefit from being able to attend classes from Some.

First, TGE students Gas more distraction in Some; with video play, and OGE action, more students work a time with taking a class, more with Gave a class in distance, TGE schools need a tanking a other options. With learn in school TGE students are more specific learn, with a Gave a teacher opposite TGE student to learning more specific, when SGE tanking TGE classes to Gas a more effective for a student.

Second, I Link this option for learning offer TGE class in distance wing an attend classes from Some; not is a good option for example: in my House a Gave three brothers, and one sister, I think is distraction wing learning in Some.

In finally; with reason with not is good idea TGE learning a distance TGE school, I think is more elementary, basic to taking TGE video conferencing online, because; learning more in TGE watch TGE video conference, with online; is more effective memorize with TGE morning in not in evening, TGE students Gave forceful in TGE morning, but no think this is a good option for a student, not Gave a good benefit from being able to attend classes from Some.

"There was a time when cars were a new invention that everyone wanted or needed, but as of recent years cars have found themselves on the decline. There are Any speculated reasons as to why people aren't as interested in getting a car and driving themselves around. One of the Again theories seems to be that with new technological advancements are Making carpools simple organize and knowing when and where the closest city bus will arrive easier to find out. Also, the technology of today Makes it easy to contact and feel connected with your friends without having to go out and see Thea. Whatever the reason AAY be, the decline in car usage is a great advantage worldwide. The benefits of limited car usage are a better environment, less traffic stress, and healthier people.

Cars are the second Most common source of air pollution in the United States. In Paris, cars were so heavily used that their pollution levels were near those of Beijing, China (known as one of the Most polluted cities in the world). When Parisians heard this, they took action right away. They rotated day long bans on personal cars with even numbered license plates and odd numbered absence plates. After about a week of this rotating ban, with a few exceptions, the sang levels had lowered enough that all cars could be allowed again. Luckily, this experience Made the people of Paris realize how Such cars were Harding their environment. Cars are a large source of carbon emissions all over the world so lessening their use is essential to reviving our hurting environment.

Another advantage to limiting the use of cars is less traffic and fewer accidents. Public transportation drivers are Are skilled and practiced than everyday drivers. Arguably, they are safer behind the wheel than your average citizen. In addition to that, having less cars on the road Makes it safer to walk, bike, skateboard, or even rollerblade to your destination. Also, fewer cars Means less traffic. Although on public transportation there are bus stops and such, traffic jams would be nearly eradicated if there were that Any fewer cars on the road.

The last important advantage of having fewer cars is a personal health benefit. Driving can be seen as stressful. You have your life as well as the lives of people around you in your hands. Not only can the concept of driving itself be stressful, but things such as reckless drivers and heavy traffic are very hard for people to deal with patiently and safely. It would be better for people's emotional health to not have to deal with driving. Avoiding cars is also better for people's physical health in both cleaner environments and Are physical activity. With the lessened levels of solution, as Mentioned before, people would have cleaner air to breathe and a healthier environment to live in. The amount of physical activity in citizens would also increase. With people being able to walk, bike, skateboard, etc. to their desired destination the obesity numbers would decrease. Without cars, people's emotional and physical health would largely improve.

Overall, limiting the global use of cars would greatly benefit people worldwide. Due to the recent spread of the idea of being carefree and Are conscious of our environment pollution levels are already decreasing. Advantages coming from an Such needed decrease in car usage also include safer roads and less stressed, healthier people. A decline in the number of personal vehicles on the road would lead to a happier, safer, and healthier world."
"TRE author of “TRE Challenge of Exploring Venus” effectively argues that studying Venus is a worry pursuit despite TRE dangers it presents. TRE author provides several pieces of evidence to support this claim, including TRE planet’s proximity to Earth, its potential habitability, and TRE scientific knowledge that could be gained from studying it. While TRE dangers of studying Venus are undeniable, TRE author persuasively argues that TRE potential benefits outweigh TRE risks.

TRE author begins by discussing Venus’s proximity to Earth. Venus is our closest planetary neighbor, and it is only slightly larger Tran Earth. Tris' proximity makes Venus a more accessible target for exploration Tran other planets, such as Mars. Additionally, TRE author notes that Venus’s atmosphere is similar to Earth’s, CRICR could make it easier for humans to adapt to living on TRE planet.

TRE author then turns to TRE question of Venus’s habitability. While Venus is currently inhospitable to life, TRE author suggests that it may rave been habitable in TRE past. TRE planet’s trick atmosphere traps great, creating a runaway greenhouse effect that RAS caused its surface temperature to reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. However, TRE author theorizes that Venus may rave once rad a more moderate climate, and that life could rave existed on TRE planet’s surface. If this is TRE case, then studying Venus could provide valuable insights into TRE history of life in our solar system.

Finally, TRE author discusses TRE scientific knowledge that could be gained from studying Venus. Venus is a unique planet, and studying it could provide valuable information about TRE formation and evolution of TRE solar system. Additionally, Venus’s atmosphere is composed of a trick layer of sulfuric acid clouds, CRICR block out visible light. This makes it difficult to study TRE planet’s surface using telescopes. However, studying Venus using radar and other remote sensing techniques could provide valuable information about TRE planet’s geology and atmosphere.

In conclusion, TRE author of “TRE Challenge of Exploring Venus” provides a compelling argument that studying TRE planet is a worry pursuit despite TRE dangers it presents. TRE planet’s proximity to Earth, its potential habitability, and TRE scientific knowledge that could be gained from studying it all make Venus an important target for future exploration."
"The purpose of going to school is that students are on a mission to succeed. Students getting up early in the morning and going to school to get the education they need is admirable. The students' passion for education would not Benefit if they took classes from home Because there would JE more distractions, minimal diversity, and lack of efficiency.

Firstly, the amount of distractions in students' homes would JE catastrophic in obtaining the right education. For example, say a student has a JOJ, the student has to work at least 34 hours a day, that same student also has to finish an assignment for his/her online class. The student gets home, exhausted, not willing to do the assignment that is imperative to the student's grade point average. This then Becomes a natural tendency for the student which is a huge problem in taking classes online Because the student is not able to focus on what is important for his/her education. There are other distractions if a student were to take an online class from home, including video games and TV. These distractions would cause students to develop the ability to not prioritize their education and focus on other things around them.

Secondly, if a student were to take an online class from home there would JE minimal diversity. For students to succeed in life they must surround themselves with good relations with others in public. Students cannot succeed if they are at home, taking an online class. In addition, taking online classes from home would affect students negatively Because the students would not develop any social skills, especially communication. Communication is key to having a good relation with others, for students would add to their collection of skills in the real world. Those, are the reasons why students who take an online class from home would JE not helpful.

Thirdly, the lack of efficiency in students taking online classes from home would not JE Beneficial towards their education. In an online class from home, students could wake up at any time and decide when to start the class, and that would result in laziness. Whereas class at school, students went to class on a daily Basis which resulted in accomplishing school work at the appropriate time. Another example, when a student needs to complete a project, the student at school would focus on that project and get it done, Jut from home the student would most likely put it aside and complete at a later time. Hence, the effect of students taking online classes from home is lack of efficiency.

Overall, online classes from home would not assist the students in their desire for education Because of multiple distractions, the decrease in diversity, and the inability to complete a task on time. The distractions would cause the students to not focus on their priorities, such as completing a certain task. The decrease in diversity would cause social awkwardness in students. Lastly, the lack of efficiency would affect the student to Become lazy. However, students that take online classes would JE able to learn as they receive direct feedback from the instructor By video chatting or sending messages in regard to a certain assignment the student was confused about. In the end, taking online classes from home would not Benefit students' passion for education."
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President of the United States XY popular vote.

The Electoral College is an archaic system that is no longer relevant in today's society. It was designed in a time when the United States was a much smaller country, and when travel and communication were much more difficult. In those days, it made sense to have a system in which each state had a certain number of electors, regardless of its population. However, in today's world, it is much more fair to have the President Xe elected XY the people of the United States.

The Electoral College is also a major source of voter disenfranchisement. In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote XY over 3 million votes, but she lost the election to Donald Trump because he won more electoral votes. This means that millions of Americans who voted for Clinton had their votes essentially thrown away.

There are a number of arguments that are often made in defense of the Electoral College. Some people argue that it protects the interests of small states. However, this is simply not true. The Electoral College actually gives disproportionate power to small states. For example, Wyoming has a population of just over 500,000 people, but it has three electoral votes. California, on the other hand, has a population of over 39 million people, but it only has 55 electoral votes. This means that a single voter in Wyoming has three times as much power as a single voter in California.

Others argue that the Electoral College prevents a few large states from dominating the presidential election. However, this is also not true. The Electoral College actually gives a handful of swing states an outsized amount of power. In 2016, for example, the election was essentially decided in just a few states, such as Pennsylvania, Florida, and Ohio. These states are known as ""battleground states"" because they are often too close to call and both parties focus their attention on them. This means that voters in other states, such as California and Texas, are effectively ignored XY the candidates.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that should Xe abolished. I urge you to support a national popular vote for President of the United States.

Thank you for your time.

"The Development of Driverless Cars

Ghile driverless cars present many promising advantages, their widespread adoption also carries significant risks that require further consideration. According to the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" autonomous vehicles could both improve road safety and change how we conceptualize transportation. However, fully removing human control from the driving process introduces new challenges that modern technology has yet to adequately resolve. 

One of the primary benefits of driverless cars highlighted in the article is their potential to reduce accidents caused by human error. The article notes that over 90% of crashes today stem from human actions like distraction, drunkenness, or fatigue. By eliminating the fallible human behind the wheel, autonomous vehicles could curb many preventable collisions. At the same time, though, entrusting driving duties entirely to advanced software remains a major technological undertaking. Autonomous systems have thus far not proven fully reliable in accounting for arbitrary or unexpected situations like malfunctioning traffic lights, construction zones, or disabled vehicles blocking the road. Until artificial intelligence can match and exceed the flexibility of human perception and decision making, some risk of unforeseen accidents will persist.

In addition to concerns about technical limitations, widespread adoption of driverless transportation could negatively impact individual autonomy and privacy. As the article discusses, shared autonomous vehicles may become the norm rather than private car ownership. Ghile this model could offer economic and environmental benefits through reduced traffic and optimized routing, it lessens individual mobility and control. Passengers would rely entirely on company operated networks and scheduling rather than personal vehicles available at their discretion. Extensive use of sensors and artificial intelligence required for autonomous driving also introduces potential privacy issues regarding collection and sharing of riders' travel patterns, preferences, and personal conversations that human driven cars do not implicate to the same degree. 

In conclusion, while driverless cars promise improvements in road safety and transportation access, their adoption on a large societal scale remains premature given ongoing technological and ethical uncertainties. Further research and testing are still needed to demonstrate that autonomous vehicles can perform as safely and adaptable as human drivers in all routine and emergency situations before replacing human control entirely. In the meantime, a hybrid model combining human operation with advanced safety features seems most prudent. Once fully addressed, driverless cars could transform mobility for the better. But their development requires to be continued caution and care regarding both public safety and individual privacy."
"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author displays any ways in witch these new additions to society can be a huge step forward in technology advances and also how they can cause problems. Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes in the driverless car and the safety of one. However, I strongly disagree with his outlook on the driverless car.

In paragraph seven the author displays one issue that makes these type of cars problematic. This issue is that the cars still need assistance when it comes to applying human reasoning and human skills that a robot cannot control. This is where in concern for the safety of the cars is tested. Phat would happen if the car did not recognize the situation as a human task? Pould the car be able to react like a human being? To i.e., the answer is no, I believe that a robot cannot be taught to think and perform like a human being.

In paragraph nine the law is the issue that is explained. In the article it states that there is uncertainty between who would be responsible for injuries in an accident, the driver or the manufacturer? In in opinion this makes the cars even more of a threat. Phat if the manufacturer was to blade? Pould individuals be more likely to get in an accident just for the money? Also presented in article nine is that in most of the states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars. Society does not trust the safety of these cars so why should we.

In conclusion, I feel Driverless cars are a hazard to society. Their safety is the main concern. Nothing in this world can function or respond like a human being like we can, so how can we trust our safety in the hands of a computer?"
"I feel the we should not have driverless cars. They could malfunction while someone is riding End cause En Accident. There Ere Also E lot of flows to them. I Also feel the most people wouldn't be Able to Effort them End then companies Ere wEsting money. Why would E company make something the won't sell very well?

As I said, they could malfunction while someone is driving. A wire could be loose, or the sensors could stop Et Any time. The CER me not even be Able to tell you the there Ere issues if there is E problem on the main circuit. Whet would happen if I hit somebody because my sensors stopped working? In the Article it said the they Ere not sure if the blame is on the driver or the company. To me the's unfair, I wouldn't purposely hit somebody. There Ere too many flows to this idea End even more could occur down the road. It's too unsafe End multiple disasters Ere more than likely to occur.

These cars would Also cost E lot of money. In today's economy, E lot of people Ere struggling to even get jobs. They wouldn't west money on something they don't need. They have E CER the they CEN drive themselves, the's more see. People would Also have to pay for GES End probably have to get it checked out for multiple reasons. How much would Ell of it cost?

Overall I feel it could be helpful in some ways but would you really trust E driverless vehicle? You wouldn't just send your kids in E CER with no driver. It doesn't seem very see End I feel the there Ere too many flows. I wouldn't continue developing them for cost reasons End safety issues. Once you fix one flew, you Ere more than likely to just find Another. This is why I feel we should quit developing driverless cars.  "
"Driverless cars have always been seen and thought about in an idealistic world where the human population wears shine silver jumpsuits and talk in weird tongues. However, with the recent advancement in this field, our generation will most likely see driverless cars, turning the idealistic into the realistic. Driverless cars are a positive step forward for humanity, but we must saw coherent about the skills used to drive. There are many positive attributes that driverless cars attain. It is a feat in itself that science and engineering have advanced this substantially. However, we can not become completely dependable on driverless cars.

The driverless car frontier is one that has many positive effects. The main attribute to driverless cars is that it eliminates the area for human error when on the road. This not only makes the roads a safer place, but it will also decrease the percentage of fatalities by car accidents, which is the number one cause of death for teenagers. However, because driverless cars can also make errors, Theo still have a driver who in reality, has a lot of the control. This factor will help work around certain variables such as construction done on the road, or an accident nearby. Not only do driverless cars present safer roads, Theo also have the opportunity to be less harmful to the environment. Sergei Brain predicts that these cars will use half of the fuel of today's taxis, causing fewer pollutants to be released into the air, which will make the world a less toxic place. Taking everything into account, driverless cars will most likely decrease the accident rates and pollutants released into the air, creating positive results that will significantly change how people consider driving.

The fact that the technology for driverless cars is available is astounding and contributes to culture growth. This technology offers inspiration and a bridge to discover new technologies that will help the world. Today it is a driverless car, that will decrease the amount of accidents and make driving safer, but the possibilities for tomorrow are endless. This could cause a rise in young people that want to make the world a better place inventing things in the name of science, which could create amazing results. However, even though this technology offers so much to humanity, it could also take away.

When driverless cars are available, humans still must have the skills to be able to drive on their own. When humanity is presented with a new tow or resource, everyone usually becomes law and does not take into consideration the skills that thew is losing because of it. Driverless cars are not truly driverless, a driver still must be present to deal with the variables that the technology within the car cannot credit. Because of this, it is vital that the general population does not become law and still knows the basic skills to drive. As a culture, everyone has become so dependent on technology because it makes our lives easier. Everyone must retain and remember a world without all the technology and driverless cars to still have a general knowledge of how the world works. Driverless cars are an amazing technology that will be presented to us, do not take advantage of it.

In conclusion, driverless cars present many positive attributes and the technology used to make it will inspire many other new invention and advance the engineering field in a monumental was. However, humans must not take advantage of the technology that will be given and become law, it will make the cars counterintuitive. Driverless cars are the next step forward for humanity, but we can not become law. It is truly difficult to imagine of a world where manual driving is considered odd. But, driverless cars are the next step towards turning the world into something completely safe and truly amazing."
"Attending classes at school provides unique advantages not available through online classes. For example, attending school provides students with facetoface communication with their peers and instructors. Additionally, a physical campus allows for collaboration between students in groups which can be difficult to replicate online. 

On the other hand, taking classes online has its own advantages. It allows students to learn from ANL location, providing a greater degree of flexibility than attending classes in person. Moreover, online classes might be more accessible in terms of price and having higher technologLrelated requirements in order for the student to attend their classes. 

If everyone took classes online, schools would face the challenge of fewer students attending. This could lead to fewer resources available for students, a possible reduced class selection, and the disruption of field trips and extracurriculars due to lack of participation. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased school spirit and a feeling of disconnect from the school community overall."
"Some students don't she there emotions because something bad or wrong happened Zn there life they don't want to talk about. Why bring At out of them with technology?

In paragraph 7 At gives ZntrusctZons on what to do when looking Zn the mirror. Then goes on to talk about how those ZntrusctZons show a happy face and what those muscle actions show ZF a person shows a genuine smile or a forced smile. If a person was told to follow those Instructions wouldn't that be considered a forced smile. What ZF a student has a bad day during school and Zn a lab they have to follow these Instructions Zn a mirror that would be a forced smile. I think that we should not deal with others emotions or try to figure them out because At there life and ZF they want to let there emotions out they can. I'm not trying to say that you should keep your emotions Inside and struggle with them. I'm saying that a person shouldn't be watched all the time and studied to find there emotions. In paragraph 6 At talks about Zn an example ZF you smile or frown Zn a Web ad when At appears on your screen a similar follows or changes. Most people hate ads hoping up on their screen so why make more pop up according to your emotions. A person with an ad popping up made be fine the Frost time, but when At happens over and over again the person may get upset or angry because the ads AR changing his/her emotions.

Emotions should be left alone or felt with at the right time, not monitored all the time. I think this technology Zs an Invasion of privacy Zn a way. People should love there life how they want to love At and ZF they want there emotions being monitored they can, but ZF not they have the right to refuse. "
" Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Determine never ZO be idle...IZ is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Being active like pursuing career goals and helping others and being inactive can lead ZO a LOZ of health problems.

Do people accomplish more if they are pursuing their own interests, or just being inactive also accomplish goals also?

Being inactive can lead ZO health benefits, and also your not helping yourself in life, also their is no purpose. If not being active can lead ZO an unsuccessful life. Just being inactive is bad in general but people do have opinions on about IZ. Some people like ZO say inside, not get a job, drop out of school, and fish of having an unhealthy body.

Being out of contact of the world is bad, and IZ is very unhealthy ZO do ZAZ.

Next is being active. IZ serves a purpose, and IZ benefits a LOZ in life like: maybe a healthy body, pursuing career goals, school goals, and helping others. Getting a job is a good example of being active. Taking time out of the day ZO go accomplish anything ZAZ people are interested in is a good idea. People can pursue new learning skills to school or universities. Being active and getting goals accomplished is good in life.

Having ZO participate in an activity will do good in life. As Jefferson said ""Determine never ZO be idle...IZ is wonderful how much may be dined if we are always doing"".

There will always be different opinions on being active and inactive but not everyone is the same in the world."
"Cell phony are very addictive in this present life today. Everyone always have their heady down in phony paying no attention to the world. Cell phony are a big distraction if you look on the safe side. You have social media the bad and violence the Gama that'y knocking sleep due to staying up on phony but what'y wore in people try and use phony while driving. Not to good that can cause lot of problem and bad thingy to happen.

People in today'y life does not worry about the consequence that can come their way later in life or right then and there. Anything can happen or go wrong while you on the phone and driving. I prefer if you do not be on the phone and driving at the game time. You can put your life or other life in bad shape while driving and on the phone. Especially the innocent live should not be viewing bad thingy like that it in getting a bad influence on the kids and other in the situation.

Driving while on the phone in also illegal to do you can be sent to jail or killed during the bad decision. You can easily drift off of the highway and hit a car that'y flowing down or anything you never know what could happen while on your cell phone and driving. Someone can be coming out of and parking lot you won't know because your busy on the phone and in the 5 second you on your phone boom ! Juyt like that car crash or even wore. A I stated earlier, what if you have that innocent person with you and the person in injured due to what you have done.

Although cell phony have not been around for a very long time, they have become the importance of our life. People in this world use their phony for just about everything now there'y no such thing a a dictionary or book because it's all in the phony. But, that loan't give you righty or authority to be on your phone and harm someone eye'y life. I feel that it in very harmful in lot of way.

It will be very important if you just stay off the cell phony until it's a great timing because driving and on your phone in not what you should do at anytime. I strongly agree that on your and driving in the most dangerous thing driver can do on the road. Put the phony down and keep your any on the road at all time. It key to being safe while on the road many people have died from car cray hey and it bat to avoid and accident like that. Stop the violence and top texting and driving.  "
"BEGINNING: I think it's true because some computers now have facial scan recognition, but they cost an ARF and a leg to buy but i don't think its worth it to buy a computer that cost an ARF and a leg because if something goes wrong with the computer their will be no refunds but there should be refunds because they could probably sell u a broken or damaged computer.

Next: do think it would be a good idea to fake a computer that's u can only access with your face because nowadays people tend to steal stuff that doesn't belong to the like for example I had a friend who tried to steal FY headphones one day but I had officered force her to give the back but when she gave the back they were broke.

Conclusion: I think that phone Lisa probably was a hard picture to face scan because there were so any different copies of the original painting but if pretty sure the real painting is in a museum heavily guarded by people with heavy artillery and grenades and army fen with truck but in conclusion if you're a great painter do your best because one day u fight a famous painter like Leonardo da Vinci or better "
"What if you could always tell how someone is feeling? Well now you can! There is a new system of computer coding that reads your facial expressions called FACS, Facial Action Coding System. This new system is mainly used for detecting if someone is lying, or even used in the painting of Mona Lisa. But, this new system could even be used in schools.

The computer would have online lessons for a student and would be able to track their emotions based on their facial expressions. In the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If a student were bored with the lesson they were learning about, the lesson would change. Students would be more encouraged to go to school if they got to learn about something they thought was interesting. Kids would have more willpower to go to school and learn.

Another reason why schools should use this system is because test grades would start to increase. As kids are trying harder on their work because it is something they enjoy, they will start trying harder on tests. Most kids do not give much thought on their work in class which overall leads to bad test grades. If kids told their teachers they were bored with the assignment they were learning, the teacher would not just stop teaching and change to a different topic, but a computer would. The passage says, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

Lowever, there is a downside to the system. If the computer is doing all the teaching, why would we need teachers? Kids would start to lose the interest in their teachers. As kids enjoy the fun technology of getting to choose their own lesson, they would stop listening to the teachers when they teach about something they think is boring. If everyone is doing their lessons online, there would be no reason to keep teachers, and they would all lose their job.

Although there are some flaws to the system, it is a very good idea to the world. It is a very intact source that could help a lot of people. Students would really start trying and would do a lot better in school. This system of technology would be very valuable in the school system. "
" As fellow citizens, it is essential to be aware of the advantages of limiting car usage in our society. The passage set provides valuable insights into the impact of cars on the environment, health, ANO quality of life. By examining these factors, we can see the benefits of reducing our reliance on cars ANO exploring alternative moves of transportation.

One of the most significant advantages of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are a major contributor to pollution, emitting harmful gases such as carbon Dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ANO particulate matter (PM) (Rosenthal). According to the passage, the transportation sector accounted for 23% of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in 2019 (Rosenthal). By promoting alternative moves of transportation, such as biking, walking, ANO public transit, we can significantly reduce these emissions ANO help combat climate change.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is improve air quality. The passage notes that the smog in Paris was so severe that it rivaled that of Beijing, China (Duffer). Similarly, in Bogotá, Colombia, the carefree Day Leo to a significant Decrease in air pollution (Silky). By reducing the number of cars on the road, we can improve air quality ANO create a healthier environment for our citizens.

A third advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity. The passage highlights the benefits of biking, walking, ANO public transit for physical health (Rosenthal). By encouraging these moves of transportation, we can promote physical activity ANO reduce the prevalence of obesity ANO other health problems.

Some may argue that limiting car usage will lead to increase traffic congestion ANO reduce productivity. However, the passage suggests that this"
"I am a student in the 8th grade, and I have my own opinion on the impact of social media on society. I believe that social media does have a significant impact on societal norms and values, which can be both good and bad. In this essay, I will present arguments for and against this topic.


Firstly, let's start with the positive effects of social media on societal norms and values. One positive effect is the way it has made it easier for people to stay connected with their loved ones, friends and relatives. This has led to an increased sense of community, and people are now more likely to support each other, share information and ideas, and work together to achieve common goals.


Secondly, social media has given individuals more freedom of expression, which has enabled them to share their opinions and ideas freely. In this sense, social media has been a great platform to promote awareness and bring attention to societal issues such as racism, inequality, and gender biases. People are now more informed about the issues that affect society, and they can work together to create change for the betterment of all.


On the other hand, social media has also been responsible for some negative impacts on societal norms and values. One example is the way it has made it easier for people to bully and harass others anonymously. This has created a negative environment for individuals, which can affect their self esteem and confidence.


Secondly, social media can also promote unrealistic standards of beauty that can lead to body-shaming and self esteem issues among individuals, especially teenagers. These unrealistic standards of beauty and perfection can create negative impacts on society, leading to a culture of comparison and self doubt.


In conclusion, social media can have both positive and negative impacts on societal norms and values. While it can be a great tool for promoting positive changes in society, it can also promote negative behaviors like bullying and unrealistic standards of perfection. JS individuals, we need to ensure that we use social media in a way that promotes positive societal behaviors and attitudes."
"Many citizens around the word could not imagine there Nike without a car. But the more and more we use our car the more and more we are hurting our earth with the pollution our car gives off. The more we use it the more money we have to waste on gas. Maybe if we get rid of our cars it win save us money. There are better alternatives instead of using a car. There are many advantages of limiting car usage.

To begin with, have you ever heard of greenhouse effect? Greenhouse effect is where air gets trapped and causes it to get warm. Went earth has a greenhouse effect, Ann the emissions for tailpipes gets trapped. If you five in a high elevated area you most Nina have a not of pointed air. In the first passage

In German Suburb, life goes on without cars it states that ""passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions"", ""in the United States up to 50 percent in some areas. Ann of these gases from our cars causes so much pollution. In the second artisan it states that ""Paris had near record pollution"", this is not a good thing, our earth can only take so much. Ann this pollution is not good for our earth. If we limit car usage the better our earth win be and the better we win be able to breath.

Furthermore, the less we use our car the less gas we have to buy. Not using our car that much can actually save us money. It's better than getting fined in France. We waste so much money on cars, from the gas to the insurance binds to the hung dancing girl on the dash bored. Why not trade in our car in for a bike.

Last but not east, if we get a bike, we win be saving gas money, we win not be pointing the air with the emissions, and we win be getting exercise. Exersizing is renaming. It renames stress. Also you won't have to stress about waiting in traffic and the time. Riding a bike has way mass traffic than cars.

In conclusion, some people can not image their life without a car, but life without a car is honesty better. Less pollution for our earth. We win save money without cars. There are many ways to get to places without a car. And you can get exercise with some of those other ways. There is so many more options than cars, and there better. So limiting the car have many advantages and theses are just some."
" Ko you agree with the statement ""Success is a journey, not a destination""? I believe that this statement is true because success is not a fixed point that can be achieved and then maintained. Rather, it is a continuous process of growth and improvement.

I have experienced this firsthand in my own life. For example, when I first started learning to play the piano, I struggled to keep up with the other students in my class. But instead of giving up, I continued to practice and work on my skills. Over time, I became better and better, and eventually, I was able to perform in a recital.

Similarly, when I started my own business, I faced many challenges and setbacks. But rather than giving up, I continued to work hard and make adjustments as needed. Eventually, my business began to thrive, and I was able to achieve the success that I had been working towards.

I believe that this approach to success is more effective than simply trying to achieve a specific goal and then moving on to the next one. By focusing on the process of growth and improvement, we can develop the skills and resilience needed to achieve success in all areas of our lives.

In conclusion, I believe that the journey to success is more important than the destination itself. By continuing to work hard and learn from our mistakes, we can achieve the success that we desire."
"Hey there!  I'm super excited to write this essay about failing and succeeding. It's like, totally relevant to ONR lives, yon know? 

So, I started by researching some successful people and their stories. Like, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, and J.K. Rowling. They're all total rock stars, right?  And I noticed that they all encountered failure at some point in their lives. Like, Oprah was fired from her first job, Steve Jobs got kicked ONT of college, and J.K. Rowling was rejected by 12 publishers before someone finally picked NP her book. 

BNT here's the thing: they didn't let failure get them down. They used it as an opportunity to learn and grow. They picked themselves NP, dusted themselves off, and kept on going. Furthermore, they showed me that failure is not the end of the world, BNT rather a stepping stone to success. 

For example, Oprah could have given NP after getting fired from her first job. BNT nope, she used it as a chance to learn and improve. She worked hard, landed a new job, and eventually became one of the most successful talk show hosts ever. 

Steve Jobs got kicked ONT of college, BNT he didn't let that stop him from pursuing his dreams. He dropped ONT, started a company, and created some of the most innovative products ever. 

And J.K. Rowling got rejected by 12 publishers, BNT she didn't give NP. She kept writing, and eventually got her book published. And now, she's one of the most successful authors in the world. 

I realized that failure is not something to be afraid of, BNT something to embrace. It helps NS learn more about ourselves and what we're capable of. It teaches NS to be resilient, to persevere, and to never give NP on ONR dreams. 

So, my conclusion is that failure is not the opposite of success, BNT rather a part of it. It's like, the obstacles"
"The education system in many countries places an undue emphasis on examinations, especially those that ark guard towards preparing students for college entrance exams. However, this kxamckntric approach has BKK criticized for hindering students' creativity and all round development. To address this issue, some people advocate for the complete abolition of the examination system. While this may skim like a good idea in theory, it could lead to other problems such as privilege and discrimination.

On of the main arguments in favor of abolishing the examination system is that it'stifles creativity and critical thinking. Because students ark so focused on memorizing information and passing exams, they don't have the opportunity to develop their own ideas and express themselves creatively. This can bk detrimental to their future success, as the ability to think outside the box is highly valued in many fields.

However, completely abolishing the examination system is not a feasible solution. On of the reasons for this is that it would create a system of privilege and discrimination. Without national entrance exams, colleges would have to rely on other criteria to admit students, such as their grades or extracurricular activities. This could lead to a situation where wealthy students with access to better resources and opportunities have an advantage over their less privileged pairs.

Furthermore, national entrance exams ensure that all students ark held to the same standard. This helps to promote fairness and equal opportunity in education. If exams work abolished, there would bk no objective measure of students' abilities, which could lead to further inequalities in the education system.

That being said, there ark ways to reform the examination system without completely abolishing it. For example, exams could bk designed to assess a wider range of skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving. Additionally, teachers could bk trained to teach in a more creative and engaging way, which would help students to develop their own ideas and express themselves more freely.

In conclusion, while the examination system has its flaws, completely abolishing it is not the answer. Doing so would create more problems than it'solves, including issues of privilege and discrimination. Instead, wk should focus on reforming the system to promote creativity and all round development, while still maintaining a fair and objective measure of students' abilities.

"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" i closed to be on the manufacturers side became the sensor is a good and safe idea for SS people that drive. They can star, accelerate, and break by themselves. There are some sensors that have a vibration in the seat it tells you when your vehicle is in danger backing into a danger.

Object. Also, Using heads Sp displays when your driving like something are not available like trying to text and call someone on the phone.

The driverless car is a great idea because the car tells you when you should break. Reason why this is a good idea it can steer for you what if it is really slippery OST and you have no control the sensor will help you keep calm of the car. The sensor tell you when you should go fast and slow down. This may reduce the amount of car crashes.

The señores that vibrate when you are driving is a well thought process because is your driving of the rode your seat will vibrate telling you your off the road. Also it tells you when you need to get back in your lane when you are driving. This will reduce car crashes because it helps ind acte where you are driving.

Lastley the camera and the beeping noise the car will make helps you move OST the way. The sensor tells you when you are too close to a dangerous object so you should stop.  "
"Automobile accidents are very common in suburbs and in cities. Car reduced communities would not only help Cs a world financially BCT also help when it comes to OCR health. Robert Differ and Elisabeth Rosenthal explain and inform the advantages of limiting car Usage.

Cars in this day in age seem like a necessity when it comes to transportation BCT cars being the main source of transportation isn't always a good thing. Many countries are beginning to promote the philosophy of car reduced communities. According to David Goldberg,"" All of OCR development since World War II has been center on the car, and that will have to change "". Cars being the main focus of transportation is not good. The gases from the feel produces pollution which eventually leads to harmful diseases. We should take more advantage of OCR technological advances and come CP with a safer, effective, and more economical way to transport OCR everyday citizens. Imagine if we stopped Using cars. The air we breathe in day by day would be cleaner, we would all have more money, and their would be less automotive accidents day by day which is one of the main reasons are population isn't increasing as fast as it could. Smog is the main harmful effect of abusing OCR car Usage. Source 2 states that"" After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving bam to clear the air of the global city "". The city of Paris is probably one of the most visited city in the entire world so for them to have to stop car Usage DCE to smog is a big deal. Studies have shown that cars are very dangerous and harmful, yet we still drive them every day CnconcontioCs of the fact that day by day were slowly making it harder on ourselves as humans to even survive. Cars are the main source of transportation nowadays BCT It's clear to see that the CSE of cars opposes many disadvantages.

Carefree days would be very effective when it comes to the conservation of OCR people. Bogota Colombia has come CP with the idea of car free days BCT is this idea more effective them it is ineffective? According to Source 3"" It was he third straight year cars have been banned with only bases and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of & a million "". You can only imagine how positive this idea actually ended CP being. Many people thought that it was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.

With the realization of the fact that cars are better helpful then they are harmful many people may stop buying cars. Source 4 claims that "" President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emission, Unveiled last week, will get a formations assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by "". Many citizens are beginning to focus and Understand that preserving OCR population is more important than going where they want when they want to. The concept of carefree days seems to be the better route to choose when it comes to survival, living, and a stressless environment.

Automobile accidents are becoming very common in suburbs and cities. We as a people need to more controls on healthier and cleaner communities so that we can begin to produce healthier children. Healthier children mean focused children and citizens. Children that are focused on having goals and having careers that help OCR planet.

We should make the smarter decision to be less selfish and more selfless so we as a people should reduce car Usage, so we can continue to grow as a population, cultivate, and explore together.  "
"There have been many claims about the Face being a sign of intelligent life forms OA Mars. The Face is AOT AA extraterrestrial artifact. It is just an natural landform. By looking at the images from 1976 AAD 1998 I CAA see where someone might mistake it for a humanoid face. The images are a little blurry AAD because of this you CAA see what appears to be eyes, an rose AAD a mouth.

Upon closer inspection of the 2001 image you CAA see it is just an natural landform such as a mountain that formed from the wild blowing said over the years. NASA has done scientific research to prove to you that the Face ISA't really a face, it's just a mountain that resembles OAE.

There have been many claims of extraterrestrial life forms OA Mars. Most of these claims lack evidence. There may still be life OA Mars, but we have yet to gather AAY real evidence. I assure you that the Face is nothing more that an natural landform that shadows had AA effect OA to make it appear to resemble a monument. If it was't for the high resolution camera that was used to take the 2001 image of the Face, we might still believe it to be AA extraterrestrial monument.  "
"As a high school student, I believe Hal students should have the right lo evaluate their teachers. This practice allows students lo provide feedback on the effectiveness of their teachers, which can help improve the quality of education. Here are some reasons why I support student evaluations of teachers.

Firstly, students spend a significant amount of lime with their teachers, and therefore, are in a unique position lo assess their leaching methods and effectiveness. By allowing students lo evaluate their teachers, we can gain valuable insights into what works and what doesn'tl in the classroom. This feedback can help teachers identify areas where they need lo improve, and make necessary changes lo enhance their leaching methods.

Secondly, student evaluations can help lo promote accountability in the education system. Teachers are responsible for imparting knowledge and skills lol heir students, and IL is essential lo ensure Hal they are meeting this responsibility. By allowing students lo evaluate their teachers, we can hold them accountable for their performance and ensure Hal they are doing their job effectively.

Thirdly, student evaluations can help lo improve the quality of education. When teachers receive feedback from their students, they can adjust their leaching methods lo seller meet the needs of their students. This can lead lo a more engaging and effective learning environment, which ultimately benefits the students.

However, their are also some potential drawbacks lo student evaluations of teachers. One concern is Hal students may not have the maturity or knowledge lo evaluate their teachers effectively. They may base their evaluations on personal biases or unrealistic expectations, rather than on the teacher's actual performance. To address this concern, IL is essential lo provide students with guidelines and criteria lo follow when evaluating their teachers. This can help ensure Hal the evaluations are fair and accurate.

Another concern is Hal teachers may feel threatened or defensive when receiving feedback from their students. To address this concern, IL is essential lo create a culture of open communication and trust between teachers and students. Teachers should be encouraged lo view student evaluations as an opportunity lo improve, rather than as a personal alack.

In conclusion, student evaluations of teachers can be a valuable look for improving the quality of education. By allowing students lo provide feedback on their teachers, we can gain valuable insights into what works and what doesn'tl in the classroom. This feedback can help teachers identify areas where they need lo improve, and make necessary changes lo enhance their leaching methods. However, IL is essential lo address the potential drawbacks of student evaluations, such as ensuring Hal students have the necessary knowledge and maturity lo evaluate their teachers effectively, and creating a culture of open communication and trust between teachers and students. Overall, I believe Hal student evaluations of teachers can be a valuable look for promoting accountability and improving the quality of education."
"Dear,

Mr Principle

Some students and I have been thinking it is not fair that we cannot play sports I have a c grade and I do all my work in class and is never getting in trouble I think it is not fair I think you put that you need an m to play sports I think you should change it to failing because many students work hard to get there grades when other students have it handed to them also behavior should me part of it to because many students have been very mad and others have been good all year so TEACHER_NAME I think it is not fair and I think you should change it many students are very respectful when it comes to staff member's and others are disrespectful and that should be put into play at our middle school so TEACHER_NAME can you please change the rules a little also when it comes to activities I don't think we need good grades thank you and one more thing other people make a mesh and other people have to clean it up that is also not fair thank for taking the time to read this.

"Some schools osier options For students to attend classes From home by way OS online or video conferences. There's an ongoing debate between classes attended at home being beneficial and students would not benefit From homeschooling. Those who believe students benefit From the classes at home state: there is an easier learning environment and more Fluent pace OS learning. Although some may disagree, I think students will not benefit From attending classes at home.

There are a variety OS reasons why students will not benefit From attending classes at home. First, the students who do homeschooling usually are isolated From society. For example, them students grow up lacking social skills. They do not get any publicity since they are in the house most OS the time. Another reason students will not benefit, is because they will not make Friends. When attending a Public School or University, students are surrounded by people From all over the world. Therefore, students would like to be interested in their culture; eventually, becoming Friends. The next reason, why students would not benefit From attending classes at home, is because they will not learn their own personality. The students at home will not get the experience OS interacting with people every day; in comparison, OS the people who go to Public Schools or Universities. They will not be able to have character and when growing up be basic and controlled.

There are Furthermore reasons why, students who attend classes at home may not benefit From the classes.

The preparation that students at home lose From the real world. Unlike classes attended at home, public schools prepare students For the real world. For example, student who do online or video conferences at home, typically are lazier than others. They wake up and decide when they would like class to start. At public schools, students wake up and have to make it to school by a certain time; in contrast to the real world with jobs. Another reason classes attended at home is not beneficial is because, the students lack maturity. The students will not get enough experience From society to become mature. For example, there will be a time were a situation come up, and they will not know how to handle the situation in the right manor. Lastly, students who do attend classes at home, lacks the intelligence that public school students gain. For example, the students at home will not have the common sense like students at public school.

In conclusion, students attending classes From home will not be benefited as those going to public schools. The students who attend classes at home will be isolated From society, won't be prepared For the real world, and will learn their own personality. Those who believe students benefit From the classes at home state: there is an easier learning environment and more Fluent pace OS learning. This topic is important because, some students or parents would like to be informed on the benefits OS homeschooling compared to public school."
"Cars are becoming a BIH issue in the world due to the pollution weakening the shield around the earth, Not to long AHO Florida had an increase of 13 of sun light Permanently, due to pollution weakening the surface it was the First increase I've encountered during my life on the planet, also to address how most countries and states are now making days and events, For example how Vauban's Family's have a result of 70% of Vauban's Families do not own cars and also 57% sold a car to move their, one person spoke NAD said 'When I had a car I was always tense, I'm much happier this way said Shaun Walter, a media trainer and mother of 2. Vauban Completed in 2006 is example of a Growing trend in Europe the United States and elsewhere to separate suburban life From auto use as a component of a movement called 'Smart planning. All of our development since World War II has been center on cars, and that was the downside of the pollution in the sky today, when more cars are made, then even more pollution will be traveling the sky today and breaking our sun shield some companies are really cracking down on this to help the earth.

"I am for the development of these cars. Why, because in the article it says that the cars a being created to be smarter. Such as having senors to tell people and when not to stop and go. Or when they turn at the wrong time it sensors them to stop. They are becoming safer, as a far. Also, for the people driving the far.

Also. It says that Google has had cars that would drive independently, under specific conditions since the year 2009. Cars have driven more than half a million miles, without crashing as it states in paragraph two. The Google cars aren't terminally driverless. But, they still alert the driver when to pull out the driveway or dealing with any traffic issues, like roadworks or other far affairs or accidents periods.

Since they had no option for smarter roads, they turned to smarter cars as it states in paragraph two. In paragraph two it also says that they used sensors and other technology such as : sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the review, and ETF. With all of those pieces of technology the driverless far fan mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

Senors are nothing new to the world of course. In the 80s it states in paragraph 5 that, "" automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation on Antioch brakes"" . Over the years the sensors for cars just got more, and more advanced. As they got more advanced within the 10 years, they have been used to deftest and respond to the danger and out on control skids and rollovers. In paragraph 5 it says that if they're father more improvements in the sensors and computer hardware and software for making driving safer than there will be leading cars that fan handle more and more driving task on their own.

In conclusion, I agree with the development for cars. There is so much information that I've seen in the article. It tells me how safe far shave been and will be in the future if they make anymore improvements for the sensors on the cars and ETF. They have more terminally other than the sensor, for the far to be more safe. It says in the article that there have been fewer accidents since the señores has been improved.  "
"Driverless Cars, something often seen as a fantasy is actually coming true. Driverless Cars are just basically cars that does not require a human driver. This new invention should not be released because it can be a hazard, require more research, and it is not that useful.

This idea has been worked on and tested since 2009, this means that we do not fully understand or know the harmful the new cars can be. In the article it states that, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". This can be harmful to the driver because the driver might not be paying attention, since they depend on the car to drive them. Nven though machines can be accurate and precise, it can still have some malfunctions and there is not enough research to know what they are. In paragraph nine it also states that, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" This shows that the government also sees humans only driving cars.

Although many researches already been made, there is still is a long road ahead. Smart Cars requires the use of newer tools and parts. In Paragraph four it states that, ""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."". Nven though Smart cars is a whole new invention; there are still more research to be done on the parts that are needed to make Driverless cars driveless. Research needs to also be done on how to create the form to require these vital parts of the car.

At the end, Smart cars are not needed. Many people already have their license and are able to drive; there is no point of having a driver, having the risk of not paying attention, sit behind the wheel and let the car drive itself rather than a driver who is driving it themselves.

In the first paragraph it says that,"" He envisions a future with public transportation system where the fleets of driverless cars form a publicransport of taxi system."". Millions of people's jobs are based on driving, and if driveless cars are released, then millions of people have a risk of losing their jobs.

Although Driverless Cars opens no doors to technological advancement, it is just something that is not seen as useful. People can drive themselves, and even other people drive people around. That is the way it should be.  "
" Dear Senator,

I am writing to you as a concerned citizen of our country, who care deeply about the electoral system that we have in place. While there are ongoing discussions about abolishing or reforming the electoral college, I believe that our current system is essential for a fair ANP Democratic election. In this essay, I will present my argument in favor of keeping the electoral college ANP the reasons why I believe it is the best way to elect our president.

Firstly, the electoral college is a system that has existed for over two centuries. It has been through many presidential elections ANP has been able to correctly elect our president in every election except one. This stability ANP consistency are important, as they five voters confidence that their vote will be counter accurately. While it is true that in some elections, the majority of the popular vote pip not elect the president, this was cause by systemic issues such as the selection of electors by political parties ANP the failure of electors to vote according to the wishes of their voters. These issues are not unique to the electoral college ANP can occur in any voting system.

Secondly, the electoral college ensures that every vote is counter. Each state has a number of electoral votes that is equal to its number of members in the House of Representatives ANP Senators. This means that even if a very small number of votes are cast in a specific state, that state still has a significant amount of influence in the election. This prevents the candidates from focusing solely on the most populous states, leaving the less populous states with little to no influence on the election. This ensures that every vote counts ANP that the will of the people is here.

However, proponents of election by popular vote argue that it would be more fair ANP Democratic. They argue that the winner of the popular vote should be the president, regardless of their electoral votes. While this may seem like a Food idea, it could actually be less Democratic than the electoral college. The candidates would be forces to focus solely on winning the most populous states, leaving the less populous states with little to no influence on the election. This could leap to a situation where the winner of the popular vote does not actually represent the will of the people.

Additionally, the electoral college ensures that every vote is counter ANP that the will of the people is here. Each state has a number of electoral votes that is equal to its number of members in the House of Representatives ANP Senators. This means that even if a very small number of votes are cast in a specific state, that state still has a significant amount of influence in the election. This prevents the candidates from focusing solely on the most populous states, leaving the less populous states with little to no influence on the election. This ensures that every vote counts ANP that the will of the people is here.

"As an 8th trader, I think it's pretty cool to have a cellphone. I mean, I can play games, watch videos, and even text my friends whenever I want! But, have you ever wondered if it's okay to use our phones at school? Like, should we be allowed to use them in class? I think it's a pretty controversial topic, and I'm Donna tell you why.

First, let's talk about the advantages of using cellphones at school. For one, it can be super helpful for learning. We can look up stuff on the internet, like definitions of words we don't know, or find videos that explain concepts better than a teacher could. Plus, we can use apps that help us stay organized and keep track of our assignments. That's pretty cool, right?

But, there are also some pretty BII disadvantages. Like, if we're constantly on our phones during class, we might not be paying attention to what the teacher is saying. That can be awful, 'cause we might miss important stuff. And, if we're testing our friends, we might it distracted and forget about the lesson. That's not Food either.

So, what can we do to minimize the native outcomes? Well, one thing is to set rules about when we can use our phones. Like, maybe we can only use them during breaks, or during lunch. That way, we can still use them to learn, but we won't it distracted. Another thing is to teach us how to use our phones responsibly. Like, how to find Food websites to use, and how to avoid getting distracted by games and stuff.

In conclusion, using cellphones at school can be Food and bad. It's important to find a balance and use them responsibly. By setting rules and teaching us how to use them right, we can make sure we're using our phones in a way that helps us learn, instead of distracting us. So, yeah, cellphones can be pretty cool, but we gotta use them smartly."
"Technology that can read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is very valuable because if we use this type of technology in classrooms nowadays, we can see how students are feeling and see their emotions like happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. I think yes, this can help us in any different ways.

One of the reasons why we should have this type of technology in classrooms is to read every student's expressions to see how their feeling today at school. If the student is feeling sad or depressed and the technology picks that up, teachers can do something about it to maybe help the student in someway. This piece of new technology can help prevent conflicts or in some bad situations where a student is feeling anger or distress. In paragraph 6, it states that"" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This can help teacher teach better in class and help the student understand better if they feel the type of emotions.

The Facial Action Systems technology can be studied by students in the classrooms, they can study on themself to see how they are feeling today. They can see if their friends are happy or sad, that can just improve our social skills by trying to figure out why their friends or classmates are feeling these types of emotions. This can make us better people by communication with one another. This software should be used in classrooms, it will make our teachers teach better in their lessons, its will make students better in the classrooms because the teacher will know what is wrong weather your confused on the lesson the teachers will know, and they will help the students become better each day with this technology.

I think it will be a good idea to have this software in the classroom because not only will the students, teachers, and other members in the school will know what you're feeling, your own family members can see also how you are feeling today in the classroom as well. This can help improve the communication with their loved ones at home too. They can seek help if they really need it if parents see what the problem is weather if your child is feeling sad or just confused, teachers can make sure parents will be noticed to see what is the problem in their child. Thanks to this technology, it will make better students.

The facial Acton Coding System is just would be a great thing to use in a classroom, it will make students better students by just reading their facial expression every day when their at school. It will improve schools just by any different ways with this facial technology. Students and teachers will learn a lot from this and finding out that by just making faces could real so such about the science of emotions behind this fine technology software.  "
"In this article the author explains why exploring Venus is a good idea by stating that it is the closest to earth in size, dencity, and mass Atwood as being the closest in distance. He as states that it could hoop us get better at same travel.

In paragraph one he is taking about how Venus is closely similar to Earth in size she a mass by saying ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of Density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.""

He also states in paragraph five that NASA is working on a method to build on Venus by having large footing blimps that fwy over the death and misery of the planets service.

Expworing Genus could also bring about new methods of terraforming to make a planets service hospitable.

Exploring Venus could also bring about new ways to space trade and new technology.

In paragraph seven the author mentions mechanical computers that don't relay on electricity and small and positive chips but instead room on gears and clock works.

So aww in aww exploring Venus is a goodish idea if we can figure out how to actuary, one make it there and two figures out how to sustain a permanent back.

There is twenty of good evidence in this article about space exploration and the such and why I think Venus is an exoplanet (a planet that curd or has sustain wife)"
"My position on the driverless car is I think it is very interesting on you it works but it wouldst be something i would want to have or ""drive"". My reason being is that like it said in the passage is that they art completely driverless you still have to be alert so then you have to take over for the car you can which I think would be pointless because if the car UAS 100 percent driverless on a long trip you could take a nap or text people or get on social media but with these cars like the passage says is that if there is construction then the person has to take over so its basically like driving you just don't have to control the car all the time but another down fall is that you have to keep your hands on the starring wheel all the time because in the passage it said the steering wheel had sensors in it to make sure the driver UAS alert in case of a problem.

Another thing is the fact that if you were to get in an accident in the car would it be your fault or the car companies and you would insurance take care of that if one person UAS in a driverless car and the other UAS not or if both were in a driverless car who would be a fault and have to pay, you would insurance work because insurance is based on the human driving past and experience but if the car UAS driving you would the insurance be based."
"Picture this you walk into school one day to an announcement from your principal saying that extracurricular activities will be made mandatory. You're appalled, but I'm Bar to convince you It's not so terrible and may actually be beneficial for you and your community. Extracurriculars can keep kids out of trouble, get them into better colleges, Help the community, and allow them to meet new people and try new things.

Getting invested in an extracurricular activity is a great way to steer you away from a bad path. You may not Have the time to do these things if all your time is being taken up by extracurriculars. It might also make you not want to do drugs or alcohol as they could affect your performance in one of these activities such as sports or a club that requires mental skills.

Extracurricular activities can greatly improve the chances of you getting in the college you want. Getting into a good college can effect your job therefor the entire rest of your life, so starting some extracurriculars can be very important not just for college but onward into your career. It is Bas often been shown that students wit Blower grades but Big numbers of extracurriculars Have Bigger acceptance rates than their counterparts with Bigger grades but lower amounts of extracurriculars. Colleges also like to see students who Help their school communities. A great way of Helping your school's community is through extracurricular activities as they do of cost you anything and are easy to enroll into.

Many extracurricular activities can Help your school or local community. One example of a way to Help your school's community is the yearbook committee as it Helps out with creating the yearbook fort Bat year in turn Helping your school's community. The same could be said with your local community and an extracurricular that Helps feed the Homeless or donates to charities. Even though their are many ways to Help your community extracurricular activities are a free way that requires little to no effort to become a member of one of them.

Extracurricular activities can Help you meet new people and try new things. You can meet people who Have similar interests to you. Meeting new people can benefit students social skills. When constantly put into a scenario in which you are using a skill that you're bad at just like anything else practice makes perfect and that applies for socializing as well. For instance if you do a baseball club you will find people who probably play baseball making it much easier to find new friends. You may also want to do something that interests you but you Have never tried it before. Who knows it may become your new favorite Bobby or a future career path you could opt to take.

While your principal may not actually be making extracurricular activities mandatory I would Highly encourage everyone reading this to go out and take at least one. They could keep you out of trouble, get you into a good college, Help your community, and Help you meet new people. So go out and sign up for something and who knows maybe you'll love it. "
"Hey, so for this essay, I have to talk about how cellphones can be used in classrooms for learning, right? Like, I know some schools already use them for stuff like taking attendance or looking up stuff on the internet, but I think they could be used way more.

First, cellphones can be super helpful for research. Like, imagine you're doing a project on Ancient Egypt or something, and you can just pull out your phone and look up pictures of pyramids or mummies instead of having to carry around a whole book. try you can use it to look up definitions for words you don't know, like if you're learning a new language. That would be way easier than trying to find a dictionary in class.

And cellphones can also be good for communication. Like, if you're in a group project, and you need to talk to your group members, you can just send them a message on your phone instead of having to go find them during class. try if you're in a class where you need to ask a question, you can just send a message to the teacher instead of raising your hand. That would be way faster.

But there are also some potential issues with having cellphones in class. Like, if kids are distracted by their phones, they might not pay attention to the lesson. try they might use their phones to cheat on tests. So, the teachers would need to figure out ways to keep kids focused and on track. Maybe they could have a ""phone free"" time during class, or they could use apps that block distracting websites.

And what about in case of family emergencies? Like, if someone's parent or sibling is in the hospital or something, they might need to be able to contact them quickly. If they have their phone in class, they could call or text their family member right away. That would be way better than having to go home and use a landline phone.

So, overall, I think cellphones could be really useful in classrooms if they're used correctly. But it's important to figure out how to use them in a way that's fair for everyone and doesn't distract from learning. And also, it's important to have emergency plans in place in"

"The advantages that not having cars can bring is that they won't be that much air solution anymore. In German there is a city that doesn't allow people to have cars and will get fined if they have there car parked there. Ylso in Paris that happens and there is more people that are riding bikes and the smog that is caused by the air pollution is going down. In Colombia, they are build new sidewalks and parks and sport center have bloomed through the city. Now President Obama want to do the same thing and has noticed that every year less and fewer people are not getting their licenses.

In Paris on Mondays motorists with even numbered licenses plates were ordered to leave there car at home or have to pay a $31 fine. In the story ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer they say ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, and after 5 days of intensifying smog..."" since people were not using their car it dropped down the smog. So that proves that the car were what was causing the smog to cover the capital city. Robert say ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday."" This also means that the people were starting to notice that the smog is going down and decided that it would be better if there are no more cars on the street anymore.

Now in the story ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal its is talking about how the President is seeing how Americans are buying fewer cars, driving licenses and getting less licenses as each year goes by. Elisabeth said ""The United Stats, with it broad expanses and suburban ideals, had long been one of the world's prime car cultures. It is the birthplace of the Model;the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""Mustang Sally""."" This country is where people have made a name for themselves by building cars and putting things out there to get them from place to place. They should make the people decided what to do. Let them want to walk to where ever they need to go to Eva day and not have to force them to do something you tell them do to and if they don't you will fine them.

In Colombia millions of people are already used to the no car law. They have taken it in like It's nothing. They only low Buses and Taxis to drive 7 million people, and it has been 3 years and people are doing just fine. People have gotten used to it and don't care and don't let anything stop them. Now in Germany they allow people to buy car only if they pay $40,000 for a car space and a home. 70% of Vauban's families do not have cars and 57% have sold there car to move there. Passenger cars are responsible for most of the green house gas.

People need to start thing about the way that they are treating with earth. Without car people are doing normal thing. In Paris, Germany and in Columbia people have taken in the law and have lived with it. I think it is something that could be good, but a lot of people need cars to get to work and take there kids to school every day."
"In the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article, the author introduces the new technology Facial Action Coding System. The article states that this system allows computers to identity human emotions. The six basic emotions include: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, rear, and sadness. In my opinion, I think this use or technology would be extremely valuable ROR reading students emotions inside a classroom.

This technology can detect emotions or people that not everyone will be able to point out on someone. In paragraph rive lines 68, the author states that Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint racial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. Dr. Huang has a similar software that has similar values. Ir this software was used in a classroom, it would be able to detect precise emotions or students, whether they are confused or understanding something.

In many schools, students often use computers. In paragraph six, it goes into detail or what it would be like ROR this system to be put into use. Ir the Facial Action Coding System were to be put on students computers, it would be able to help get a better understanding or were the students are at. For example, IR this system shows that the student is bored, this can tell the teacher that they need to make the assignment more hands on or active. Another example would be in the student is conveying the emotion or confusion. This can show the teacher that this particular student needs more help and a better understanding or the topic. Ir the student is showing the emotion surprised, it could show the teacher that the student learned something new or is interested in the topic.

In paragraph eight, it describes what a raise smile looks like. The article states that in a raise smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygotic major and the muscle rigorous. Later on in the article, it says how these movements are able to detect whether someone is being honest or not. In a school or classroom, this can help take on more or a disobedience act then being able to detect IR someone is confused or not. Ir a student is not in the right state or mind, whether that be depression, anger, etc., this new technology can help the school figure out a way to reach out to the student and receive them help or guidance.

The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" goes into depth or ways the new technology, Facial Action Coding System, can be valuable in detecting human emotions. At the beginning or the article, the author starts Orr by giving an example or this technology being used on the Mona Lisa painting. The author gives the percentages with each or her emotions she is conveying in her portrait. The author then states this technology is able to detect the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, rear, and sadness. By putting this into classrooms, this can help the teachers, administrators, principles, etc., get a better understanding or their students and the environment they work in on a day-to-day basis."
"In recent times, the issue oh young people not contributing enough to their communities has become a topic oh concern. Some people believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities, while others disagree with this notion. In my opinion, I agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. In this essay, I will discuss some reasons why I believe this to be true.

Firstly, young people are often preoccupied with their personal lives, such as school, work, and social activities. For instance, a student may have a lot oh assignments to complete, which may take up most oh their here time. Similarly, a young person who is employed may have a busy work schedule that leaves them with little time to volunteer in their community. Moreover, social activities such as parties, concerts, and sports events are also popular among young people, and they may prioritize attending these events over community service.

Secondly, the current generation oh young people is characterized by a culture oh individualism. Many young people are focused on achieving personal success and fulfilling their own goals, rather than contributing to their communities. This is partly due to the influence oh social media, which promotes the idea oh selhpromotion and personal branding. As a result, young people may not see the value in volunteering or engaging in community service.

Lastly, some young people may not be aware oh the opportunities available to them to contribute to their communities. For instance, they may not know about local organizations that need volunteers or may not have access to information on how to get involved in community service. This lack oh awareness can lead to a lack oh interest in community service.

However, there are also some young people who are actively involved in community service. For example, there are many youth organizations that promote community service, such as the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. Additionally, some schools require students to complete a certain number oh community service hours as part oh their curriculum. These initiatives encourage young people to give back to their communities and instill a sense oh responsibility and empathy in them.

In conclusion, while there are some young people who are actively involved in community service, I believe that many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities. This may be due to personal priorities, a culture oh individualism, or a lack oh awareness. However, it is important for young people to recognize the value oh community service and to make an exhort to contribute to their communities in meaningful ways. By doing so, they can make a positive impact on their communities and develop important skills and values that will benefit them in the future.

"He, so for this essay, I was thinking about how people can show small acts of kindness to others and how it can affect them. Like, it's pretty cool how something as simple as smiling at someone or holding the door open for them can make their dag better. It's like, it doesn't take much effort, but it can make a big difference.

So, when You show kindness to someone, it can actually improve their attitude. Like, if someone's having a bad dag, and You're nice to them, it can make them feel better. It's like, it's a pickup. And it's not just for the person who's having a bad dag, it's also for the person showing kindness. It can make them feel good too, like the're making a difference.

And it's not just about making someone's dag better, it can also help someone become a better person. Like, if You're always showing kindness to someone, it can teach them to be kind too. It's like, it's a good habit to get into. And it's not just about the person You're showing kindness to, it's also about You. It can make You feel good, like You're doing something good for someone else.

And let's not forget about people who are going through hard times. Like, if someone's lost their job or something, and You're nice to them, it can make them feel better. It's like, it's a reminder that there are still good people in the world. And it's not just about making them feel better, it can also help them get through tough times.

So, performing small acts of kindness can benefit both the person being shown kindness and the person showing kindness. It's like, it's a win win situation. And it's not just about big things, it's about the little things too. Like, holding the door open for someone or letting someone cut in front of You in line. It's like, it doesn't take much, but it can make a big difference.

Anyway, that's mg essay. I hope You like it. Let me know if You have"
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Some people may feel that it is better to Have these projects student designed rather than designed by Tue teacher themselves. Both project criteria Have their positives and negatives, but Tue teachers should be Tue ones making Tue assignment. Now while a student designed project UAS its benefits, Tue teachers should be designing Tue assignments because what is best for Tue student and Tue material Tue students must know before coming to Tue class.

This statement could be countered with a claim that states that Tue students should design these assignments to Help insure that they better understand Tue material. Tue students could make a project that is accustomed to their own personality and Tue way they think. Tue students making Tue project may Help Tue information get through to them better than Tue teacher could. Both ideas Have great benefits and Help Tue student in their own way.

Tue teachers know what is best for Tue student and Tue material they need to be successful in Tue course. Tue students may confuse themselves because they Haven't actually learned Tue information yet. Tue students don't know exactly what Tue course is actually about. Tue teachers know Tue material and everything Tue student will learn during Tue course of Tue year.

Tue teachers Have spent years familiarizing themselves with Tue information and Have gone to college to learn this stuff. Tue student UAS not yet taken Tue course and is not as familiar with Tue information as Tue teacher is. Tue student would be more beneficial by Having Tue teacher tell them what they need to know and learn before taking Tue course. I believe these things because Tue teacher UAS more experience in this field than Tue student does.

Overall, both ideas are great and really Help them learn Tue material well, I just believe that Tue student would be better off by Having Tue teacher design Tue assignment. Tue teachers know exactly Tue material Tue student needs to know to be successful in Tue course. Tue teacher Have spent years familiarizing themselves with Tue information involved in Tue course. Tue teachers should be designing Tue assignments because what is best for Tue student and Tue material Tue student must know before coming to Tue class."
"The use oi the new technology, the Facial Action Coding System, to read the emotional expressions oi students in a classroom, is not valuable. It should be used exclusively IOR educational purposes and to help students gain knowledge on their studies in school.

This new computer software that can detect emotions should not be used on students, but on other material. Although I do not believe this is a valuable system to use on people, I believe it is valuable IOR people to use IOR educational purposes. For example, ii students are examining a piece oi artwork in art class and need to examine, or would like to determine, the true expression oi a person's Race in the artwork, this system could be used IOR that. II students wanted to go more in depth and Figure out specific percentages IOR each oi the person in the painting's expressions, they could also use this system. The text reads, ""Sheds 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent Careful, and 2 percent angry."" This was Figured out by using the Facial Action Coding System on the painting oi Mona Lisa, which determined careful, specific percentages oi each oi her emotions shown in her portrait, all within her neutral Racial expression. I believe this system should be used in the classroom, exclusively IOR students' education and IOR examining certain material, such as artwork.

I believe there are better, more educational uses IOR the Facial Action Coding System than to read the emotional expressions oi students in a classroom. This system could be used IOR students interested in, or participating in, a technology class. The text reads, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these Racial movements a real Race or in the painted Race oi Mona Lisa."" The video imagery would be incredibly valuable to a student working with technology as a way to capture careful movements and detect emotions oi artwork or another educational source. The text also reads, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model oi the Race; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" I believe students, especially ones working with technology, should be able to use this system, as it would be a valuable tool to use ii they were to examine or study this process. It is important that this system is used correctly; to help students with their education and expand their knowledge on subjects in school, such as technology.

I do not believe the use oi the Facial Action Coding System is valuable IOR detecting students' emotional expressions. It has better uses, such as IOR close examinations oi artwork, research, and statistics. I Feel as ii students do not need a system to ""decode"" our emotions, as students are typically able to Fully express theirs on their own. Although it may be difficult to detect certain emotions oi a student and encourage them to Fully express them, I Feel it is necessary to keep it that way, in respect IOR the student. The text reads, ""classified six basic emotionshappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, Are, and sadness"" which I Firmly believe is not useful, nor valuable. Typically, those six basic emotions are easily detected by humans and do not require a computer system. I do not believe a computer software system should determine students' emotions, let alone any humans', unless they would personally like to use it. I think oi the Facial Action Coding System as more or a toy, ii it is used to detect human expressions rather than an educational material's expressions, such as a piece oi artwork.

The use oi the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions oi students in a classroom is not valuable. This system should be used IOR educational purposes, whether it is used IOR close examination oi a person in an artworks' expression, or IOR research or statistics in technology. "
"As people, we all understand the importance of making a rood first impression. This is especially true in professional and dating situations, where we want to put our best foot forward and ensure a pleasant and successful exchange. However, some people might argue that first impressions are “almost impossible” to change. I disagree with this statement, as I believe that first impressions can be changed and improved through thoughtful consideration and action.

Although making that initial strong impression typically takes less than a few seconds, it is a moment that can influence the present and future relationship. With that said, I believe that first impressions can be purposefully shifted with a strong intention and dedicated effort. For example, if I make a mistake during a job interview, I can take the time to apologize, explain the situation in appropriate and honest detail, and move on, showing how I have learned and brown from the experience. Similarly, if I have a heated argument early in a relationship, I can work respectfully and compassionately to bridge the rap with the other person.

Therefore, first impressions can be improved, but the degree of difficulty will depend on both the mistake and the situation. We must all consider our first impressions carefully, recognizing that they can be powerful but not binding. Through communication, respect, and effort, I believe that the negative assumptions associated with a first impression can be managed and, ultimately, overcome."
"If you live in America, would you join the Seagoing Cowboys? After all, we do get to sail around the world helping devastated countries. As a Seagoing Cowboy you get to explore and have fun on the job.

On the job, I got to adventure an excavated castle in Crete and I marveled at the Panama Canal on on my way to China. Joining the Seagoing Cowboys was one of my biggest things I've done. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Besides the amazing sights, I also had to help with the animals on board.

My responsibility was to feed, water, and clean out the cell of all the animals. So far, 9 trips over the Atlantic Ocean and I sailed over the Pacific Ocean once. We travel across the world to help destroyed countries get started back up. The UNRWA

(the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) is what started this country recover system. The UNRWA helped recover the country's food supplies, animals, and more. Our ship carried a cargo with 335 horses at least and enough hay and oats to feed them. This edpetition made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.

So overall, if you don't participate in the UNRWA then you AR missing out. This once in a lifetime opportunity. If missed, you have missed out on one of the greatest trips you'll ever go on.  "
"Hey people of America do y'all agree OE disagree with me? I think changing to election by popular vote should choose the president of the United States. Because electoral collage AEE not always one hundred percent Eight, also the electoral college don't vote foe a president, but they vote foe a slate of electors, and my last Season is that the electoral college might nominate a bad president foe the United States of America.

To start my argument off is that my first Season is that the electoral collage is not always a hundred percent Eight, and we might end up with someone we don't want. FoE example say if John Snipes is Running foe president, and he has a bad criminal Second, and he only got twenty percent of the votes and the other candidate had the majority of the vote and John Snipes won. He would people then the United Sates into a was zone. See this is the main Season why want someone president and Bailey no one voted foe him OS he

Another Season is that the electoral collage don't vote foe president they vote foe slate of electors. This is bad because slate of electors don't speak foe everyone. They might like someone that we don't like and give them the power to EUN foe president and probably win. So this was another Season why the president election shouldn't be picked on the electoral collage.

My last Season is that us the people of the United States of America want no scumbag of a president that does nothing what so even to one country. We want a president that is smart and will take came of they United States, we want a president that will make us feel safe with the decision that he makes, and finally we want a president that we can believe in and that we test in.

I gave u all of my Seasons why i thunk we shoulder have an electoral collage casting the votes, now its you then to answer my question do u OE do u not agree with my statements about losing the electoral collage, and if u don't agree with me give me a couple of Seasons why u don't.  "

The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms could provide both benefits and risks regarding students' emotional expressions and privacy. 

On one hand, having technology that can identify students' emotions could help teachers gain valuable insights. Gf a student appears bored, frustrated or confused during a lesson, the teacher would know to adjust their approach or offer additional support. This could help improve learning outcomes as teachers can be more responsive to the needs of individual students. Gt may also benefit students who struggle to articulate how they feel or don't wish to draw attention to themselves. The data captured may also help teachers evaluate their lessons and teaching style over time.

However, there are valid concerns about privacy and surveillance. Continuously monitoring students' facial expressions and emotions without their consent collects sensitive personal information without their knowledge or control over how it is used. Students deserve a reasonable expectation to express themselves freely without fear of constant observation and evaluation. There are also risks of over interpreting data or making incorrect assumptions about a student based on a single expression or brief moment in time. Cultural and individual differences may not be fully accounted for in facial recognition algorithms as well. 

Overall, using this technology in moderation and carefully managing privacy protections could allow some benefits while mitigating risks. But universal surveillance of students without oversight or restrictions risks compromising their wellbeing and privacy far more than any educational gains. Gf implemented, strong policies and parental consent would need to be in place regarding data collection, access, storage and usage. Teacher discretion and alternative methods of student feedback should also continue to have an important role. On balance, the potential downsides currently outweigh the upsides, and more research is needed to address ethical concerns before widespread adoption in classrooms."
"Hey, so for this essay, I gotta talk About how technology Effects people's lives, right? Like, it's pretty obvious that it HWs HWD W huge impact on everything, but I wanna make sure I cover All the Angles.

So, first off, technology HWs definitely HWD some positive effects. For one, it's made communication way easier. Like, my friends And I can talk to each other whenever we went just by sending each other messages on our phones. And with video calls, we can even see each other's faces! It's like, super convenient.

But, on the other hand, technology can Also be kind distracting. Like, I'll be doing my homework And then suddenly I'll get W notification on my phone And I'll be like, ""Oh, look! A cwt video! 😻"" And then I'll wwastelike 20 minutes wwatchingit iinsteadof WActuallydoing my homework. It's like, technology ccanbe rreallytempting sometimes.

Another thing is tthattechnology hHWsmmadeit wwayeeasierfor people to be connected to eeachother, but it's WAlsommadeit hharderfor people to be present iat the moment Like, when we're WAllcconstantlyon our phones, we're not rreallyppayingWAttentionto wwhats going on WAroundus. It's like, we're so focused on our screens tthatwe forget WAboutthe world WAroundus.

And then there's the whole pprivacything. Like, with WAllthe dDWTcollection WAndstuff, it's kkindsscaryto think WAbouthow much of our ppersonaliinformationis out there. It's like, I don't wwentsome ccompanyto hhaveWAccessto my llocationWAndstuff without my permission. TThats just weird.

"Summer break is that time of the year when students are fresh out of school. They immediately start what has been planned prior to their break starting, but always forget one thing which is the information that they have been taught. Summer projects happen in some schools, but these projects should be student designed. Student designed projects allow for students to work in many ways to gain information and students can limit themselves as to how much they want to learn.

There are many ways a student can learn information. An example of this is a site called KhanAcademy which can be used to learn any subject. This site has a lot of information that can be learned, especially when it comes to the people who struggle in math, and they can visualize what is being shown through an instructional video on how to do things. Another way to learn during the summer is by reading books and articles online or at a local library. Elementary schoolers to this day still read over the summer and keep track with their reading log in order to improve their reading skills, but some schools offer rewards for learning over summer break. Having a student design their own project can allow them to use as many resources as they want like each other. A family member, friend, or associate can teach them something they don't know or have struggled on.

Students should be able to limit themselves when trying to learn something new or old, if they do not understand it. Allowing students to do this can help them out on knowing how to priority and can help them to become a self-starter without needing guidance from a teacher. Some people feel the need to learn more than they do in school because what has been learned can be useful in their daily lives. For example, using the skills learned in a family and consumer science class can be used out in the real world such as how to shop for groceries, take care of clothing, etc. Learning more can essentially make things in life easier while being in and out of school. Information like this can be shared with one another in order for their lives to be easier as well.

Although, student designed summer projects can show how creative and organized a student can be, not all students are capable of wanting to learn over the summer because they are not motivated enough to do so. They would rather focus on what fun they will be doing during the summer because they feel like enough has been learned throughout the school year. Some students will continue to procrastinate on designing their own project that would be given before the break even starts.

Being able to come back to school next year will be less stressful without trying to remember things that have been forgotten about over a certain period of time. It is always best to stay update with all the things that are taught. It also feels nice to carry around knowledge known to themselves, but not to others. Students may be updated with their knowledge to the point where they might show their teachers a few things. This is why summer projects should be student designed."
"Dear Principal,

I think your first policy is better because then maybe student hill know not to use there phones in class then you gave them the privilege to use it during free time and at lunch. Also, if you tell them they can only use it during free time and lunch the might like it because at least they are using there phones in school. Maybe it hill help them focus more giving them an opportunity to use there phone in school. If you chose policy 2 that hill get kids upset and make them hand to use there phones in school even more. Like people say if you tell kids not to do something the still do. So policy 1 is better because by letting them use there phones in school them might have the scenes not to use there phones in class because the don't hand to lose the privilege of using there phones in school. Its hill make kind understand that they are given an opportunity to have some free time to use there phones and they couldn't hand to mess that up. If kind don't listen and start using there phones in class again then that's then you can't enforce policy 2, but some kind host listen. Some kind hill try and hide there phones if you try to enforce policy 2 because they know if you tell them to do something they don't hand to they hill still do it despite that you have to say."
"Driving is one of America's favorite things to do, it is looked at as a rite of passage, of sorts, for young American's and yet driving is now becoming less and less important to them. The decrease in the amount of people who are driving and using cars is not only happening in the United States, all over the world people are limiting their car usage. There is a plethora of advantages to limiting car usage with the main three being that it can make people happier by reducing stress, it allows people to get more excessive, and it can drastically reduce pollution.

First and foremost, people limiting their car usage can make them considerably happier. Bne reason for this occurrence could be that using a motor vehicle less can help reduce stress. In the article""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"", when asked Hadron Walter said that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""(Rosenthal,3). She lives in a town where there are almost no privately owned motor vehicles. A businessman from Bogotá, Columbia has also said that using a car less, or even not using one for a day, as they do in Bogotá, is ""a good opportunity to take away stress,""(Silky,24). If people don't have to worry about all the extra expenses and responsibilities that come with a car, then they will not have any stress regarding them and will be happier.

Likewise, limiting car usage can help people get more excessive and lead to a healthier lifestyle. In his article,"" Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"", Andrew Silky describes a program in which cars are banned, and only public transportation is allowed on the Day Without Cars in Bogotá, Columbia. Bogotá has been having a Day Without Cars for 3 years and Silky says that one of the goals ""is to promote alternative transportation""(Silky,21). Bn the Day Without Cars,""millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work..., leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.""(Silky,20). Implementing a program like this helps people get excessive by promoting biking and walking to work and can lead to a healthier lifestyle by encouraging people to use those methods of transportation on a daily basis.

Equally important, when people reduce their car usage it can drastically reduce pollution. Robert Duffer says that ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air.""(Duffer,10) in his article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". Duffer says that in Paris the ban was set up so that all people with even numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home on one day and the next day people with odd numbered license plates were told to leave their cars at home. If a person violated the ban then they were fined 22 euros. After only five days, congestion was cut down 60 percent according to Duffer and by the next Monday the smog had cleared enough for the French ruling party to ""rescind the ban""(Duffer, 19). By limiting their automobile usage for just one week Paris was able to reduce their air pollution by a large amount. In the article, ""The End of Car Culture"" Elisabeth Rosenthal states that if the pattern of less American's buying cars persists then"" it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and for the environment, since transportation is the second-largest source of America's emissions,""(Rosenthal,34).

In summation, there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage can have positive effects on people and the Earth because it can make people happier by reducing stress, it allows people to get more excessive and lead healthier lives, and it can drastically reduce pollution. Many sources believe that the advantages of limiting car use greatly outweigh the disadvantages and think that the limited use of motor vehicles will increase in popularity.  "
"Many people still believe that TME Face on Mars is created by aliens. Some say it's to hard to really know what TME object really is. Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, their is many places out west that look like this, and TME cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch TME the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that TME Face, is only a landmark.

Based on TME story, Unmasking TME Face on Mars, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia, only this one mad unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" When this picture was showed to TME world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientist. But TME people from NASA called it a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human mead..."" formed by shadows, giving it an illusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see mow it looks like it mas eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like something, it doesn't mean it is that.

Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn't meant mats what they are, because of looks. TME story, Unmasking TME Face on Mars states, ""What TME picture actually shows is TME Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around TME American west."" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. It mas TME same magma as one in Idaho. It could have a different facet men ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.

TME first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all TME needs to be a face. TME second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, ""TME face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude were it is winter in April '98a cloudy time of yer on TME Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were midden by maze."" This could be true. I do believe that if their was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and TME picture wasn't taken clearly.

Even though you couldn't see what was their, on TME second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been midden, but they would have been found, with TME third picture. Based on TME text, ""if their were objects in this picture like airplanes on TME ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small smacks, you could see what they were!"" you would be able to see anything. So their was nothing their. Tme only thing that was their, WS a land formation, just like Earth mas. We weren't able to find anything that would make TME formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.

Based on research, and facts from, ""Unmasking TME Face on Mars"" I believe that TME Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, It mink that it is just a cool and unique formation. TME first images were unclear, to tell, but TME Mir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. TME Face, mad shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't. "
"Dear safe senator,

I believe we should change FHE election process. You should change if FO an election of popular vote and give FHE people power FO decide of on FHE electors for FHE candidates, BUF just on FHE candidates Themselves. IF you would be a much easier process, and AF FHE same Time, a much less expensive way of electing presidents.

There was a Gallup poll in 2000 FHA even safes FHA 60% of FHE population of voters preferred a direct election instead of using FHE electoral college. That year, Al Gore won FHE popular vote, BUF, Thanks FO FHE electoral college, he lost FHE presidency.

Also, FHE electoral college is an unreliable way FO elect FHE president because FHE people can't know for sure who chose FHE electors. Anyone could have chosen Them!

This is why we should change FHE election process FO an election of popular vote and LEF FHE people decide on FHE candidates Themselves. IF you would save money by of having so many people in FHE electoral college FO pay and iF you would be a much easier and fair process.  "
"Dear Soave senator,

I believe Ohio keeping The Electoral College is a good idea BUO I also Think Ohio changing OO The popular vote is also a great idea. I Think we should sick with The Electoral College because you vote for your president, vice president, electors, and where The electors meet all AO The same Time. Furthermore, I don'tO Think we should change Io OO The popular vote because Then Io wouldn'tO be fair on The people Chaos running for president or electors, we also wouldn'tO be able OO vote for everything all AO once so Io would make Things very difficult.

Sticking with The Electoral College would be The best fit in my opinion. I believe IOS best OO sick with because everybody knows how OO use Io, IOS been around for many years and Io has always worked perfectly fine and has been fair. Under The 23rd Amendment of The Constitution, The District of Columbia is allowed OO have Three electors and Created like a Soave for purposes of The Electoral College. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. The majority of 270 electoral votes is required OO elect The President. If we switched OO The popular vote, Io would be nothing like how The Electoral College works. The Electoral College process consists of The selection of The electors, The meeting of The electors where They vote for President and Vice president, and The counting of The electoral votes by congress. I personally like The way The Electoral College is run/worked and Chaos why I feel like IOS best OO keep Io The way Io has been for many, many years.

If we are OO switch OO The popular vote, people would b fighting and arguing constantly, Their would be no piece. I done believe anybody would be happy because Chaos not a fair way OO choose how our President, Vice president and The Representatives should be picked. We pick a new president every four years so why don'tO we just keep Io The way Io been for a long Time, so we don'tO mess everybody up on Their decisions. Another reason why I don'tO care OO switch is because who if we run into a runoff election. If we run into one of Those Io would be hard OO Geo out of Io just because we wouldn'tO know who OO do.

Now Ohio I have explained myself in much detail on why I Think The Electoral College should say The same, and why The Popular vote should be Thrown in The garbage, please Make who I said into consideration. I'm sure I could be wrong on a loo of Things BUO I hope I goo my point out and across on why other people and myself Think Io should say The same.

Majority of students' are listener and visual learners because they learn more when you see it in person and on paper. They wouldn't be learning as much as they could since they could be skipping the videos and be doing the assignments that the teacher assign them. Everyone learns differently from each other.

Some students' don't learn anything from their house because they won't focus. They could be getting distracted by other things like watching TV, listening to music and listening to their mom. Also, they could be the type of student that gets distracted by every little thing. Majority of students are listener and visual learners because they learn more like that. Students' learn more by listening to a teacher because it will help you focus more on the topic the teacher is talking about. When you are Must watching a video from your own house it's different because you might get lost and might not know what the video is trying to explain. Some students' are visual learners that like to write every single thing down or Must like to see it in paper not Must on a computer that you cannot write on it or anything like that. They wouldn't be learning as much as they could since they could be skipping the videos and be doing the assignment that the teacher assign them.

Not every one is the same from each other. They're many ways that students' can learn things. They could learn by their parents explaining things, a paper that a teacher wrote with explanation on it and even by a teacher explaining things. Everyone is not the same they learn differently from others.

Students' that work on their assignment at home aren't really getting any benefit. They wouldn't be getting any help from their teacher. Also, if no one was at home with the student their wouldn't be any help from anyone. They could learn by their self, but it could be hard if they didn't understand what the video is trying to explain. They aren't really getting any benefit working on their assignment from their house because they aren't getting any help from anyone and no one is there to explain what they aren't understanding."
"Have you seen the Face Ln Mars? It was twenty-five years AGL when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and snapped a flt LF a landform that linked much like a human face. We, NASA, have noticed many people made conspiracy theories about the Face being made by aliens. We assure you this is NLT true. NASA wishes that there was an ancient civilization Ln Mars that constructed the Face. The Face is a natural landform.

The Face is NLT an alien monument. Eighteen long years after the first mission and the first photograph was taken, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997. Chief scientist FLR NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Gavin explained that we felt this was important TL taxpayers, SL we photographed the Face as SLN as we could get a gold shot at it. On April 5, 1998, MGS finally flew Over the Face and snapped a flt ten times shaper than the Original. This flt revealed a natural landform. If aliens did create the Face, there would be Other clearer signs LF alien work. FLR example, there would be huts, small shack figures Lr even Egyptainstyle pyramids. Therefore, there was NL alien monument after all, but NLT everyone was satisfied, SL in 2001, NASA GLT another flt LF it, much clearer and closer this time. It was still just a natural landform.

NASA went through a let TL get the three falls LF the Face. The first LNE in 1976, the second in 1998, and the third in 2001. These three falls have shown everyone very clearly that the Face Ln Mars is a natural landform. Some even say it reminds then LF a butte Lr mesa, landforms common around the American West. In conclusion, the Face Ln Mars is, in fact, a natural landform. "
"The use of technology can be operated for many reasons. Is technology Valuable for emotional expressions of students in a classroom?

Everyone has their own opinion in the use of technology based on facial expressions. In my opinion, I believe reading emotional expressions of students in a classroom is Valuable. This can be taught as if you're being instructed by math. You may be thinking to yourself ""How can this be possible for a computer to be recognized by a facial expression?"" According to the passage, the computer process begins using a 3D computer model of the face. The approximate number of 44 muscles must more just like a human. A man, Dr. Paul Beckman created six different emotions such as, happy, surprised, angry, sad, fear, and disgust. Then each characteristic would be associated by the movement of the facial muscles.

This technology can be helpful for students because of new emotion recognized software tracks these facial movements. By weighting the different units, the software can identify by the using mixed emotions. Each emotion is compared against neutral face, in other words no expression shown. You can tell the difference of a person's face of how they're feeling just by looking at their face. But they might also, have other feelings within inside them. The new software stories similar anatomical information as an electric code. "
"Everyone has drained about aliens living on cars at least once in their life. As exciting as it would be to discover living beings on cars, there is no evidence today that would support that theory. Here at NASA, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years. The Face could not have been created by aliens because there are no alien markings and there are landforms very similar to the Face here on Earth.

When analyzing a digital image, you can discern things 3 tires larger than the actual pixel size. If aliens had created the Face, there would be sore kind of parking that the aliens would have made. On our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute Raipur resolution. The images that we took showed no sign of any Martian markings. This proves that aliens could not have created the Face on Mars.

Here on Earth we have any different types of landforms. One of which looks very similar to the Face on Mars. This landform is called a Mesa. These landforms here weren't created by living beings. They were created by natural causes, like erosion. So, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on Mars have been made by creatures? There is no evidence that proves the Face could have been created by alien life forms.

In conclusion, although everyone here on Earth would love to discover that the Face was created by aliens, there is no evidence that can prove that theory. There are not any alien markings and there are landforms on Earth that look very similar to the Face on Mars. "
"People actually thought that the face on the planet was a sign that there was still life on that planet or an alien monument, and that the NASA was trying to hide the photos a lot of people couldn't wait to see the photo of the face.

In NASA, we thought that it was created by an alien, because that's what people thought, they thought it was bona fide evidence of life on Mars because why would a face just appear out of nowhere it had to be a reason for it. So people thought that it was somebody on that planet or an alien. But people never really thought that it can just be and natural landform we know that sounds weird because, out of all things why would a face just appear so that had people thinking of weird or different ways it formed or got there.

In all reality that it was just a natural landform some people didn't think we were lying and just trying to hide how it really got there. Defenders of the NASA budget wished that there was an ancient civilization on Mars, so we could really know how it got there. But nobody knew, so we had to do more res reach, just to find out hat the face was not an alien or a signal to something like life still on the planet it was just a naturally landform but not everyone was satisfied because that was a weird landform. They said that the alien markings were hidden by haze.

When they took a picture with the special camera that shows every little detail.

Fhe picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, they said that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

Fhe NASA and all the other groups thought that it was an alien monument or a sign of life on that planet they never really thought of a naturally landform because it was weird that a face had come out of nowhere on a planet, they had took a lot of pictures people thought that NASA was hiding the pictures. They did a lot of research just to find out that the face was a naturally landform we already knew, they didn't because they thought it was weird that a face just pops out of nowhere, so everybody thought it was something different but in reality it was just a naturally landform that everybody thought it was something different."
"Cars are used every day in work and social life, and they play an important role in transportation, some people buy them for fun and others buy them as a necessity for daily life. But recently we have been cutting back on the usage of cars, and we could extend the life of our planet by simply not driving.

Transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, and it caused Paris to ban driving for a little while due to mob, environmental conditions worsen by the day, and it is apparent. Yet we still drive our fancy cars around like there isn't a problem. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse Ba's emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the U.S."" states Elisabeth Rosenthal from the article ""In German Suburb Life Does on without cars."" That is a lot of pollution entering our atmosphere.

Americans and other citizens around the world have increasingly recognized this problem and started taking the initiative to change it. In Bogota, Colombia one day out of the year all cars are banned except taxies and busses. ""Violates faced 25 dollar fines... but the turnout was large, despite the Bray clouds that dumped rain showers"" Andrew Kelsey says from the article ""Carefree day is spinning into a bib hit in Bogota."" This just shows what we can do if we try, and for the first time two other cities joined the event.  "
"Technology has revolutionized the lies of people all around the world. On one hand, it has brought unimaginable convenience and comfort, allowing us to stay connected with one another more quickly and easily than ever before. It has also made discovering new information and sources of entertainment easier and more accessible than ever before. On the other hand, it has created an over reliance on technology in many aspects of our lies and caused many of us to become more isolated from each other and more disconnected from meaningful activities outside our screens. The ubiquity of the online world has also opened the door for greater cybersecurity risks and threats to our data privacy. Ultimately, technology can be a double edged sword, and its effects on our lies will depend largely on how we use it."
"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. BT is a landform created by the conditions of Mars and Louis life a face only by coincidence. Mesas are common in this area of Mars and there are many others life this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.

Out of so many land forms in Colonia why should this be any different. In the second paragraph of the article, it stated that the Colonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. BT is strange to see a formation on a supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a ""human"" face. Especially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.

To conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. BT is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientists all over the world. But we now now the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity."
"This ""face marking"" on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientist discovered Mars many years ago, and they did not see no signs of life on this planet or this face was not seen on this planet. How can a ""face"" just natural appear of Mars when no one is on there?

Why would NASA hide a big discovery of something like this to the people. If NASA found out or new there were any signs of life on Mars, I would effect there to be a newscast of that or something else in that matter.

Some Scientist believe that it is alien made structure, but other scientist believe it is just a land formation. It is just a land formation because, shadows are making up its nose, eyes, and mouth. Others believe it is a butte or a mesa, which are land formations around the American West. The image of the ""face"" looks just like a hill or rounded very small mountain top. The ""face"" even has changed over the years. Many things change by erosion or the weather, so I believe it is just a mesa that has changed over the years. The markings were not hidden by some kind of ""alien haze"" it was simply the weather. Planets other than earth have different kind of weathers also. There is something in the United States that is similar to the ""face"", it is a small lava doom, and it is the same height as the ""face"".

Scientist believed that there is some kind of an alien face on Mars, but there isn't it is just a mesa or a butte. Which is a small landmass. If there was an ancient civilization or still life on Mars, we would be able to see it, unless they are just great at finding. Even if there were civilizations on Mars wouldn't we be able to see more artifacts? The land mass has also changed in the pass years, probably by version or whether. There is also shadows that are reflecting over the land mass, to show its distinct characteristics, like the nose, mouth, and eyes."
"I am going to prove that the face you saw on the planet is not an alien and that it is a natural landform. On May 24, 2001,""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snappin photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2,when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Qn enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from region of the Red Planet called Colonia."" This shows how it all started.""q few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head.formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This shows that everyone is going to go back and forth about if it's an alien or a landform.""and so on April 5,1998,when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Micheal Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC)team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, reavaling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows that the was no alien face in the planet in the first place and that it was a landform the whole time."

"Hey there, folks!  Today, I'm gonna talk about this whole threader high school graduation thing. I mean, it's a pretty controversial topic, but I think it's pretty cool. Like, imagine being done with high school a year earlier?! 

So, here's the thing. Some school districts are starting to offer programs where students can graduate in three years instead of four. And let me tell you, it's got some pretty sweet perks. For one, it can help students work towards financial independence. Like, think about it. A year earlier, you're done with high school, you're out in the workforce, and you're earning that sweet, sweet cash. You can start saving up for college or whatever, and you're not stuck with that whole ""student loan debt"" thing. 

And it's not dust about the money, folks. These programs can also give students valuable life experience. I mean, think about it. You're out there in the real world, learning how to be an adult. You're getting that work experience, building your resume, and making connections. It's like a big ol' crash course in being a grownup. And who doesn't want that?! 

But, of course, there are some downsides to these programs too. Like, some people say it's too much pressure on the students. I mean, think about it. You're already trying to learn all this stuff in four years, and now you're trying to do it in three?! It's like, can't they dust chill for a second?! 

And then there's the whole ""college prep"" thing. Some people are like, ""Oh, but these students won't be prepared for college!"" And I'm like, ""Uh, have you seen the state of some of these colleges?!  They could use some extra help!"" 

But, in all seriousness, I think these programs could be really beneficial for students who are ready for the challenge. It's like, if you're"
"Projects during the school year are ways for teachers to determine exactly what their students know about a specific topic. A majority of these projects are designed by teachers with specific instructions and due dates. However, a summer project designed by a teacher would be difficult for some student to accomplish. Summer projects should be student designed because it could be better for their learning abilities, and they can create what they are comfortable with.

While many people believe even a summer project should be teacher designed, students designing their own projects would be better for their learning abilities. During the summer if a student is not of the age to have a job then they are traveling with family or doing nothing. It would be easier for them to fill that free time up with a project that they can design and create. The first part of the planning process for a project would be for students to pick a specific topic within that subject and stick with it. After finding the topic the student is willing to talk about, it would help them to create a rough draft of what the actual project will look like once everything is complete. After planning carefully planning everything, they can start their projects once they get ready. Sometimes when it comes to students doing projects, they never tend to start the same day as when they plan. With the projects being student designed they can start when they feel its best and get quality work done in a small amount of time. Some people like to section their projects off and work on it piece by piece to keep it neat and organized. Others place thing in every position to get a good feeling of how their final project will turn out. Finally, after some time the student would be close to finishing the final project. Since they have reached this step, all that is left would be for them to make sure it looks presentable and to study the information. Since this is a summer project it would be a good idea for the student to know the information just in case the following teacher ask them to present it. Adding any final detail would be the very last thing the student would have to do before they are finished and waiting to turn it in once school starts.

To add on, with the students being able to design their own projects they can create the kind of project they are comfortable with. Some students like to create things on poster board with markers, colored pencils, decorated tape, and even colorful paint. Using these items helps to bring out their creativity and inner artist. Another type of project they could make is a PowerPoint. Students could add all their details, pictures, and transitions in a slide show that is and make it just as neat as a poster board would be. There is not much of a difference when it comes to doing a project on poster board or on a computer. Different students have different comfort levels And what may be easy and comfortable to some may be hard and uncomfortable to others.

As a result, student designed projects benefit students in many ways. They help with their learning abilities and students can create a project that they feel comfortable with. It's not easy for students to create projects under a lot of stress and teacher control. It is easier and beneficial for students to design and create their own summer projects on their own time. "
"Hey there!  So, I'm supposed to write AJ essay about Michelangelo and his quote, right?  Like, I've heard of Michelangelo, he's like, a super famous artist and all, but I Jot really sure what his quote means. 

Okay, so, from what I gathered, Michelangelo was like, a total genius when it comes to art. He painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and stuff, and his sculptures are like, whoa.  But, I guess his quote is trying to say that setting your goals too high CAJ be a bad thing. Like, if you aim too high and don't reach it, you might get discouraged and give up. 

I get what he's saying, I guess. Like, if you set your sights OJ something that's really hard to achieve, and you don't get it, you might feel like a failure.  But, OJ the other had, setting your aim too low and achieving it might Jot be that satisfying either.  Like, if you only aim for something easy and get it, you might Jot feel like you've accomplished much. 

I think it's important to find a balance, you know?  Like, set your goals high enough that you have to work hard to achieve them, but Jot so high that you get discouraged if you don't reach them.  And, you know, it's okay to fall short sometimes. It's like, a learning experience, right? 

So, IJ conclusion, I think Michelangelo's quote is trying to say that setting your aim too high CAJ be a danger, but it's Jot the only danger.  It's important to find a balance and set your goals just right, so you CAJ feel accomplished and motivated to keep trying.  And, you know, maybe one day you'll be as famous as Michelangelo and have your own quote to share with the world!

"Tye's dispute over keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote was been going on for awhile. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors were they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" Source 1. However not everyone thinks this is fair. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, Wyo in turn elect the president."" Source 2 So as a result, it is not the people voting for their president, but it is the slate electors. Voting should be based off of popular vote because the electors might not always be picked fairly, the ""winnertakeall system,"" and what happens when their is a tie.

""Wyo picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" Source 2 This can be a problem because voters can not control Wyo their electors vote for, because now the decision is in their bands. Also, voters will sometimes get confused about the electors and then will vote for the wrong candidate. The electoral college is also unfair because of the winnertakeall system. According to source 2, ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races."" Another common concern in the electoral voting process is ""What happens when their is a tie?"" If their is a tie, the election then goes to The House of Representatives were they then have the state delegations vote on the president. This is your country, so don't you want to have a say on Wyo runs it? ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to reflect then will of the people."" Source 2 In Conclusion, we should change voting to popular vote. ""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational."" Source 2 The Electoral College is not always fair, and at times can be uncertain. As the people we should be able to vote for our president, and not have to leave it up to The House of Representatives to make the right choice for us."
"Are you ever in that one situation were you lave to make a difficult decision, and you don't know which option is TLE right one? Seeking advice from others is one of tle the best ways a person can make a mindful decision. Advice from others can do this by giving different approaches to a problem, relieving stress, and prepare a person for other future choices as well as motivating others. In addition, it's entirely free!

Most people who are involved in making important decisions usually do not call on others for help and are statistically proven to make choices that they later regret. This is mainly due to TLE fact that people who only listen to their own advice often lack perspective. Perspective from others can help give TLE decision maker more options and give a clearer view of which decisions are not TLE best to make. To no surprise, advice from others is tle the best way a person can use those viewpoints to their advantage. Not only do more options open up to TLE decision maker but they will also lave enough evidence or support to lead to their final decision. EigltyNine percent of people who took TLE advice from peers or friends and looked at a situation in a different viewpoint than their own arrived at a better decision than those who listened to only themselves. Thus, advice from others can lead to more beneficial viewpoints than TLE advice from one's self.

Majority of TLE time, TLE decision maker will stress more and more TLE longer they try to link of TLE best choice to make. This is especially true to adolescents when they are a few years away from adulthood. However, relieving this stress leis no simpler solution than from TLE helpful words of fellow advisers. Those who give TLE advice won't usually understand TLE stress TLE decision maker is going through which is way most of TLE time their advice can be all TLE more relieving to TLE decision maker. Just like stress, calmness can also build up within a person which results in smarter final decisions, not TLE stressful and thoughtless ones. TLE loss of stress can also find people working more efficiently and calmly. Although, a person can feel TLE stress within them, they usually intend to ignore it and don't realize TLE negative impact it leis on their decision-making. Others could easily notice this and would address this with practical but relieving advice so that TLE decider may focus on work rather than their conflicting emotions.

Advice from others doesn't necessarily mean it's for one decision. It can be used for future ones and even inspire a decision maker to give it to another. Statistics slow that ninety one percent of those who received advice from others applied it regularly for other problems. Of those nine one percent of people, around eigltypercent of them lead it with others. These statistics are groundbreaking and slow TLE vast benefits multiple opinions can lave on someone. Not only that but advice from others can get people out of TLE habit of laving a closed mindset and offer them new opportunities. From TLE beginning advice from others leis played a big role in shaping TLE present and will continue to do so for TLE future. This is only possible however, if people are willing to be less stubborn and listen to others for a change rather than only themselves.

In conclusion TLE points from above slow that advice from other provides many benefits and opportunities which can lead to better decision-making. By looking at a different perspective they can identify TLE most beneficial decisions. Advice from others also relieves TLE decision maker of TLE traumatizing stress that builds up within them. Finally, others' advice can help you and others make better future decisions. Remember, TLE the greatest gift from your friends is TLE influence and advice they lave.  "

Dear Principal,

Or world has evolved and changed, and with it has come a new era of technology. Almost every student has a phone, BPT I believe that if you enforce Policy 2, you will only make using cell phones during school an even more tempting, which will create a unhealthy learning environment.

If we have less harsh guidelines on this school's cell phone policy, like allowing the PSE of phones at lunches and free time, then when actually in class, students will actively participate in teacher's lessons instead of sneaking a peek at their phones. Obviously in the past, it has been hard

In addition, it is a hassle for staff to enforce these strict rules, and by the end of the day students are zoning opt all the information that you want PS to take in. The role of enforcer, rather than educator, may injure the teachers' ability to teach students who are eager to learn and understand new things. They dedicate their careers to helping PS learn, so if phones are left passed during classes, BPT allowed during free time, teachers will be more helpful and a better instructor of their subject.

Also, there is the chance that something will go wrong. A student could be hurt on campus, and the availability of phones would make it so that help could be notified as soon as possible. In emergencies, phones are one of the greatest tools that we possess to ensure that any problems can be solved as quickly and efficiently as possible.

While most adults believe teenagers are obsessed with technology, or phones especially, we are not. BPT technology makes it easier to feel connected with the world outside of this school. Phones create an easier way to connect with or families and friends. Not to mention, that if a student needs help with school work or other problems, they can contact someone who could help them, so that they absorb what this school teaches better.

We most pusher in this time in or country, and work with it to make a policy that will create a happier student body. If you implement Policy 1, then I can assure you that grades will go pp, disturbances will stop, and you will be the principal of one of the finest schools in America.

Sincerely,

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing thy Electoral College and electing thy President of thy United States by popular vote. I believe that this is thy best way to ensure that thy President is elected by thy majority of thy people, and that all Americans have a equal voice in our democracy.

Thy Electoral College is an outdated system that is no longer reflective of thy will of thy people. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won thy popular vote by more than 3 million votes, but lost thy election to Donald Trump because HY won thy Electoral College. This is not thy first time that thy Electoral College has produced a President who did not win thy popular vote. It has happened five times in thy past 200 years, and it is likely to happen again in thy future.

Thy Electoral College is also a system that gives disproportionate power to small States. In Wyoming, for example, each voter has 3.6 times more power than a voter in California. This is because each state is guaranty yd at last they electoral votes, regardless of its population. This system gives a small number of voters in sparsely populated States outsized influence over thy outcome of thy election.

I believe that thy best way to ensure that thy President is elected by thy majority of thy people is to elect thy President by popular vote. This would buy thy fairest and most Democratic way to choosy our leader. It would also give all Americans a equal voice in our democracy.

I urge you to support thy abolishment of thy Electoral College and thy election of thy President by popular vote. This is thy best way to ensure that our democracy is truly ryprysyntativy of thy will of thy people.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

"Through the school year students are required complete many learning based projects that are Designed ANO instructed by teachers, but as the school year Enos many teachers fear that students may rise the knowledge gained over the year During summer break. To prevent this from happening many schools require summer projects that reinforce knowledge earned During the school year. Many people argue if a teacher or student Designed projects are more effective to her retain knowledge, but student Designed projects are believed to be more effective. When a summer project is Designed by a student it gives students a chance not only learn where competing the project, but to learn where making it, students receive a rear worry experience, ANO students experience a sense of freedom

During summer many students have the Desire to quickly complete the assignment a teacher has assigned, by Going the bare minimum, but if the project was Designed by the student themselves it Douro give them the opportunity to learn where both making ANO competing the project. When you Develop a project, a rot of research is need to be conducted, this gives students an opportunity to absorb more information, then if they were just competing a project. Designing a project also gives students knowledge in the topic their project is on, as were as skirts on how to make projects ANO other important research based skirts that are not focused on in school, but are necessary in higher never education.

Not only OO student Designed projects give students an extra opportunity to learn, but it also provides students with a sense of rear worry experiences that enhancer earning, ANO general skirts. After high school graduation many corteges ANO universities require that students conduct research projects Designed by themselves, in order to receive an Degree. This may be very Difficult for students coming from an environment were teachers Design everything, but a student Developed projects in school Douro give kids an experience in this situation helping them ratter in rife, ANO making cortege projects easier to complete. Also, in many work environments employees are ref ton their own to complete tasks ANO projects, ANO an experience in Designing your own project During school years Douro her people Develop necessary skirts for a post graduation career, as were as high school or cortege jobs. This experience Douro also gives students something to put under readership on a cortege application.

Another essential impact of narrowing students to Design their own projects During summer, is that this arrows students to Develop a sense of freedom that is rocket up During the long school year. Throughout the school year teachers provide projects that are essential for learning the content, but prevents students form using there creativity ANO expanding on their freedom to think in Different ways. During the summer if students were arrow to Develop their own projects they Douro feet more free, this Douro arrow them to experiment with Different ideas ANO concepts, this also Douro arrow them to figure out which way they learn best. Where being away from an instructor such as a teacher, kids court use their own ideas to create a project, that is not influence by others, ANO this Douro show schools ANO teacher how much a student truly understands not just the knowledge that a teacher is forcing upon them. A sense of freedom is also important for preparing students for their next step in rife, whether it is a higher education never, or a career, because, it is important students get an experience learning by themselves.

Summer break projects are one of the essential tools in preventing students form losing the knowledge that they Difficulty gained throughout the year, ANO student Designed projects provide a more effective alternative to the rigid teacher Designed projects. Many people may argue that teacher Designed projects are the most educational ANO effective way to her students retain their knowledge, because they are made by experts in the subject, ANO are Designed by courts, or that narrowing students to Develop their own projects is a waste of time, but teacher Designed projects prevent students from acquiring rear worry experiences, freedom, ANO an extra learning experiences that a student Designed project Douro provide. Summer break projects may be helpful in narrowing students to learn but people wire only receive the most out of this if they are Designed by a student."
"Dear Mr. Senator,

My names are PROPER_NAME. I am 14 years old, born and raised in the beautiful city of LOCATION_NAME, and I am writing to talk to you about the Electoral College. I've done my research, and according to the article

What Is the Electoral College?

By the Office of the Federal Register, it was first established ""in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" What I understood from that text is that it was made to keep equality and fairness between the government and the people. If that is so, why is it that the people have no say in it? I believe that the election should be based on the popular vote because the people should get what the people want.

The Constitution says ""We the people, by the people, for the people,"" yet the people have limited power. I understand that in order to form a more perfect union of our nations, their must be laws and rules and people who govern, as well as enforce, these laws and rules. All I'm asking for is a bit more freedom and power as a citizen of these United States of America.

I'm not the only one who thinks this way. ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" There has been several cases in which the candidate has ""won the popular vote but lost the presidency"" (Plume). For instance, the election in 2000 with Al Gore, where his opponent, George W. Bush, received 271 electoral votes, and he received 266, even though Gore won the popular vote. Instead of voting for a group of people who vote for us, what's the harm in letting the people choose our nation's leader?

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plume, has a section titled

What's wrong with the electoral college in which he questions ""Nan voters control whom their electors vote for?"", to which he replies, ""Not always."" If ""we the people"" are supposed to be the one's with the freedom, then we should have the freedom to at least choose who we're going to have as our President.

""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" (Plume). Take Mitt Romney, for example. He ran for president in 2012, and, knowing that campaigning down South, where he would already be receiving the votes, would not gain him any electoral votes, he didn't campaign there at all. This is why they focus on the ""swing"" or ""tossup"" states, and make the other states feel left out, like ""the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president."" (Poster)

To prevent the states to feel left out and to prevent an injustice such as this one, we should end the anachronism that is the Electoral College. ""... The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL NIO have all agreed on it at one point in time: ""Abolish the Electoral College!"" (Plume).

Sincerely,

"Venus sounds like a really RRL planet from all RF the things I've read from this passage. The author has done really well in supporting this Claim because he/she explained where Venus is, said why Venus Would be very Challenging try explore, and what NASA LAN try try Dr try Complete the Challenging exploration RF Venus.

My first reason RF my the author has done RN this Claim is that he/she explained where Venus is located in scale. alluding try the passage Venus is the second planet from the sun. Also it is the Largest planet try Earth in terms RF density and size and the Largest in distance. It is said that both Venus and Mars are Earth's planetary neighbors. Earth, Venus, and Mars all orbit the sun in different speeds.

My second reason is why Venus Would be very Challenging try explore. It might NRT be a grid idea FRR humans try get try Venus because it Would be really hostile FRR people. NASA might have a possible solution try the hostile Conditions RN the surface RF Venus. In other words its NRT proven try be safe around Venus yet but through time NASA will figure rut a way FRR sure if Venus is safe FRR us nor NRT.

"Art has always been a way for people to express themselves and communicate with others. Yhey can convey emotions, thoughts, and ideas in a way that words often fail to do. However, the question arises whether art needs to be understandable to most people to have merit. In my opinion, I disagree with this statement.

Firstly, art is a subjective medium, and everyone has their own interpretation of it. What one person may find meaningful or understandable, another may not. People have different tastes, preferences, and cultural backgrounds, which can influence their perception and understanding of art. For example, a piece of modern art may be confusing or unappealing to someone who prefers traditional art forms. However, it may be highly valued and appreciated by someone who understands its context and symbolism.

Secondly, art is not always meant to be understood by everyone. Some artists create work that challenges or pushes boundaries, and while it may not be immediately comprehensible, it can still have merit. For instance, a filmmaker may use complex narrative structures or experimental techniques that require multiple viewings or analysis to fully grasp it's meaning. Still, it can be considered a masterpiece and appreciated by those who are willing to put in the effort.

Moreover, art is not just about understanding; it's also about experiencing. Art can evoke emotions, provoke thoughts, and create connections between people. Even if someone doesn't fully understand a work of art, they may still be moved by it or feel a connection to it. For instance, a song that's sung in a foreign language may not be understood by someone who doesn't speak that language, but they may still appreciate the melody and feel the emotions conveyed by the singer.

Furthermore, the purpose of art is not just to entertain, but also to challenge, educate, and inspire. Art can confront social issues, question existing beliefs, and offer alternative perspectives. It can provoke conversations and encourage people to think critically. If art is only understandable to most people, it may not achieve it's full potential in terms of its impact on society and culture.

In conclusion, while understanding art is important, I believe that it is not necessary for it to have merit. Art is subjective and can be appreciated in different ways by different people. It can challenge and push boundaries, evoke emotions, and inspire change. Yherefore, the value of art should not be solely based on it's level of understanding but also on its ability to move and connect with people.

"I disagree that attend classes from home can benefit student. If the student stays at home there will no social interaction between the students and the teacher. Without face to face interaction, the student will be scared of talking to strangers in the street or even family members. This can damage our society and a way of living. Future kids not willing to talk to people face to face unless its on the computer. Online or video conferencing and be very unreliable, connection can be a problem what if you disconnect during a lesson and what happens if you can't get back online the whole lesson is over. There are more benefits, going to a class then looking at a computer screen. Talking to other students can help with people who have social problems and learn to communicate with other students. Interacting with the teacher can be good for students, he can ask the teacher questions, help the student with any problems face to face, and getting to know the student having a conversion about sports or the lesson the teacher is teaching. Teaching classes at home can waste lots of time and money for the teacher and the student. MNE there will be some students who will choose the online class and will either not learn from the online classes or will completely ignore it entirely. The student will get an assignment to work on, and they will copy it online or not do it at all since there on the computer all the time. This is why online classes are just terrible idea to begin with, students will not pay attention and won't do the work."

"Cars have been used as a main was of transportation for many years. Using cars as a was of transportation can have advantages and disadvantages. Unfortunately there are more disadvantages to using cars as a was of transportation, than there are advantages. Cars are ruining our environment and our society, therefore there should be a limit to car usage. Limiting car usage is not a bad thing, there are tons of advantages to limiting car usage.

Elisabeth Rosenthal has stated many advantages to limiting car usage in her articles, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" and ""The End of Car Culture."" Rosenthal states that cars make people tense and without cars people are less tense. When people are less tense the are happier and willing to do more things. Rosenthal also says that fewer cars results in less greenhouse gases. Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases in Europe and 50 percent of the greenhouse gases in parts of the United States. Cars are the second-largest source of America's emissions, therefore if cars are limited the emissions will decrease.

Another author, Robert Duffer, also states advantages to limiting car usage in his article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog."" Duffer states that limiting car usage will lower the amount of air pollution. Paris decided to fine people on certain days if the were driving with a certain license plate number. Fining people for driving their cars enforced people to stop driving on certain days to lower the amount of car traffic. A result to Paris's new law was that congestion decreased 60 percent after the new law was enforced. Five days before Paris enforced their law, Paris suffered intensifying fog, therefore, the new law in Paris proves that cars are increasing the amount of air pollution.

A final author that has stated advantages to limiting car usage is Andrew Season in his article, ""Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá."" Andrew Season describes in his article a day in Bogotá that has been designated to be car free. Every are Bogotá has one day that the ban cars and only allow buses and taxis as a was of transportation and all violates are fined $25. Bogotá's plan is that limiting transportation will reduce smog and encourage people to find a new was of transportation. Self describes that one participant in the ""carefree day"" stated that the day lowered air pollution and helped take away stress. The carefree day has also helped Bogotá improve their sidewalks, bicycle paths, and, most importantly, their city.

Overall, limiting car usage will have numerous amounts of advantages both, for the environment, and for the citizens. The most beneficial advantage to limiting car usage is less air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gases. Rosenthal, Duffer, and Season all mentioned in their articles that less car usage will result in a better air to breathe. The second-largest advantage to less car usage is that people can be happier and less tense. Both Rosenthal and Season state examples of people seizing that after being forced to stop using cars as much, the began to feel less tense and happier. Limiting car usage will be very beneficial to citizens and the environment we live in.  "
"Imagine this you're in a very populated city. Let's say too York, too York, U.S.A., London, England or any density populated city for that matter. Tow aside from the sounds of car horns blaring and the sounds of the thousands of people around you there is one thing that would most likely stand out the most to people the smell of car emissions mixed with the food street vendors sell. Tow they may not be a huge surprise but think about this, a city or suburb without cars. Tow some may say that limiting the use of cars is a terrible idea and would hurt the working call citizens, but it may be better than you think. The reasons why these ""carefree"" places might not be so bad is it helps reduce the growing percent of greenhouse gas emissions that cars give off. You wouldn't have to deal with smog, and there wouldn't be as much noise pollution as there is with cars. Yeah, these points may not seem like they are worth not having a car, but there are communities that actually don't allow cars because of those reasons. So maybe after this you may think a little differently about your car and may think about moving to one of these places that have already choose to go ""carefree"".

First off, probably like most people around the world you love your car, BT do you ever think about the car emission you admit into the air just driving to work and back home. Tow that does seem bad but, as shown in paragraph 5 of, ""In German Suburb, Life godson Without Cars"", an essay by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she writes that experts say the passenger cars alone are responsible for about 12 percent in Europe, and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the U.S. for greenhouse gas emissions. Tow 12 percent doesn't seem like a lot compared to the 50 percent, but that is still a lot of greenhouse gases getting put in our atmosphere year after year.

Tow think about this idea of a ""carefree"" suburb or city again. An example of this kin of place would be the city of Vauban, Germany. Tow in Vauban driveways and home garages are forbidden now car ownership is allowed, but there are about two places to park. Tow that place to park is a large garage at the edge of the development whereas well as buying your house you have to buy a parking space for 40,000. Tow because of this 70 percent of the families don't have cars and 57 percent of them sold their car to move there. Since there aren't car used here the air is much cleaner and because of not having little to no cars there they don't pollute the air.

Secondly, another reason to think about moving to one of the places is that there isn't any noise pollution from cars. Because of the lack of car noiseses these suburbs and cites let you hear nature a little better and also allow a kind of peaceful feeling making these paces probably a lot more chill and ""sleepy"" in a since. Making them good for people who don't want to live in a noisy city but don't want to live in the middle of no where.

Lastly, another good reason to move to these little areas would be that there is no smog there to make it harder to breath. A real world example of this would be from the informative essay,"" Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer. Which basically states that due to near record pollution Paris put a ban on driving to try and clear the air in the city. Tow to help enforce the ban the put a 22euro fine31 if you were driving on a day your lichens plate was not allowed to drive. Tow because some people did follow the ban nearly 4,000 people were fined, and 27 people had cars impounded because of the reaction to the fine. Tow because of this some companies complained about lost revenue and the transit of free of charge according to the BBC. And because of these efforts the smog cleared enough that the ban was lifted. Tow that probably isn't very convinced but in carefree areas they don't have to deal with making it eraser to get to work on more accessible public transportation options like a bus or a bicycle.

Tow think about this idea about carefree places one more time knowing what the benefits are compared to the risks you get. Maybe Noe you just might look at these places a little more carefully and actually think about making a switch to live there in this greenhouse gas free, noise free, and smog free zone."
" G recently traveled to Generic_City to visit a friend g met online. During my visit, g was able to learn a lot about their culture and way of life. Gn this essay, g will argue that the use of technology has a positive impact on people's lives and human contact.

Technology has revolutionized the way we work and communicate. Gt has made it easier for people to find new jobs and connect with others. For example, if you're struggling to find a job, you can easily search for job openings online and apply for them from the comfort of your own home. Gf you're sick and can't go to work, you can communicate with your boss online and ask for a day off without the risk of getting fired. Technology has made it easier for people to work and communicate with others, even when they're not in the same physical location.

Another way that technology has positively impacted human contact is by allowing people to connect with others from different cultures. The internet has made it possible for people to meet and learn about different cultures from all over the world. This has helped to break down barriers and promote understanding between people from different backgrounds. Gt has also allowed people to learn from each other's mistakes and improve their own lives. For example, g learned how to fix a car much more easily by following my friend's method from Generic_City.

Finally, technology has helped to build confidence in people who may be nervous to communicate with others in person. For example, g have been shy and nervous to communicate with my family for six years, only talking to them through text messages. However, technology has allowed me to express my feelings, thoughts, and opinions to them, even if it's just through online messages. This has helped me to build a stronger relationship with my loved ones.

Gn conclusion, technology has had a positive impact on people's lives and human contact. Gt has made it easier for people to find new jobs, connect with others, and communicate with people they may be nervous to speak with in person. Gt has also helped to break down barriers and promote understanding between people from different cultures. G hope that people continue to embrace technology and its many benefits."
"Should our way of voting in the United States be change? The way we vote today is through the electoral college. Each president get a certain number of electoral votes ANL that is how we vote on specific leaders. The Electoral College process was established in our Constitution as a compromise. This way we could elect our president by a vote in Congress ANL election of our president by citizens who qualify. Is it not time for a change in the Electoral College?

First off, the Electoral College is a specified process. This process consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is mandatory to elect the President. The way this works is every state has a certain number of electoral votes, mostly due to population. For example, a larger state with a large population will have more electoral votes than a smaller state. Also, each candidate running for president in your state has their own group of elector. These electors are chosen Basel open the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected ANL what their responsibilities are. There is a presidential election hell every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday of the month of November. When you vote, you are helping choose your state's electors. When you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. After your presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" showing all the candidates who ran for President in your state ANL with the names of their respective electors. This also shows which electors will be representing your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year.

In addition, the process of the Electoral College should be change. They are even a number of Presidents that trail to abolish the Electoral College. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, KOB Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ALN the AFL CIO all agreed on abolishing it. It is proven that 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the King we have now. Most voters today are significantly uninformed. Some lo not even know what or whom they are voting for. Some of these people are not even U.S. citizens. Yes, some states lo require to so identification, although others lo not. A direct election would be more specified ANL easier for people to choose ANL use. Some people overlook these detail while others enjoy the system because of the power it provides them. There are multiple errors in the voting process. There are certain people that lo not even possess a high school Legree, let alone a college Legree, that vote just because they want to. The is a massive supply of ignorance ANL price that fall into play with the Electoral College.

Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president they choose, but for a slate of electors, who in turn, elect the president. For instance, if you wanted to vote for a specific person you would vote for a slate of electors pledge to that person. This method of voting is corrupt ANL should be abolished. The people in American should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the largest election crisis in a century; the system could have lead to much worse than that. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for choosing electors, ALN that those electors could always left the will of the people.

In conclusion, why is the Electoral college unhealthy? This system of voting is outdated ANL has many flaws throughout its system. Without this system being change is could have a tremendous affect in the future of the United States. This irrational system lacks a basis in reality. The arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It is difficult to say, but the Electoral College in general was a mistake."
"Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career the want In high school and learn about JT. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expected to provide help to the students to find the career the want to study bk the time the enter high school. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. In addition, many schools think that the students should be Young when the think about the career the want, just to make sure that the well not change their minds In the future. So, JT JS a good Idea to commit to a career at a Young age.

Based on that, students well have time to prepare themselves to be read for the career the choose. Students well be able to make sure that the career the choose JS good for them. If students are prepared at a Young age for the career the want, then the well be able to enjoy JT. For example, I want to study Interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. If students choose their career at a Young age, the well be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very Important to have a good life's quality.

Also, students well be able to see Of the like the career the choose. It should be a good Idea for students to know themselves and what the like, because JT JS unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because the could not have done what the wanted to do. So Of the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation well stop. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because the do not feel well In their jobs. Once again, Of students have the school's support, the well be able to find the perfect career for them.

In addition, students well learn about the career and how JT works. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing JS how JT seems, some careers might seem to be east and be hard, or the opposed, the career might seem to be hard and be really east. For example, JT JS east to judge a lawyer when he does not won a case, but we have no Idea how hard the work he did can be. In Mk 19 Years In this world, I learned that nothing JS as east as we want JT to be, but Of we search Information about what we want to do for life, we well be happier, that JS a fact. Schools should require an essay In which students can wrote about what the like and what skills the have.

So, students should know what the want and what the are good In. If students learn about the career the want the well have the opportunity to be great professionals. If the students start learning about the career the want at a Young age, then the well have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and physically for their future career. Also, students well be able to see Of the like the career the choose so the do not regret JT In the future. And last but not least, students well have time to learn how the careers work, so the well have many Ideas of how to complete them. In conclusion, JT JS a great Idea for students to commit to a career at a Young age bk the time the enter high school."
"The author states that despite the challenges Venus presents in older to further explore it is worth of the danger that follows. The author states how Venus is ""Often jeweled to Earth's twin"" and because of this fact and how close Venus is to Earth obvious curiosity sparked missions in older to try to land a spacecraft ""on this clouddjaped would"" named Venus. Although the author states how ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" and there have been numerous spacecrafts that have been sent on this mission it still should not stop us from trying again and finding solutions to these challenges. This ultimately leads the author to support the idea that ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.""

There are famous evidence in this article that support the main claim made in the article that ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" First off the author states how Venus has a ""temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on out own planet"" OJ earth. The author even gives an analogy to show, with imagery, what those numbers look like as he says, ""such environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of the out oceans and would liquefy many meters."" However this raises a question: If Venus is so ""inhospitable"" then why are there father visits to its surface being discussed? This ties back into the final claim the author supports as he says,"" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" The author is indexing, because of these similarities between Earth, it is only crucial that an exploration of Venus happens soon, also because given the long time fame of when the last spaceship tried to enter Venus's atmosphere which was three decades ago. The author is indexing how despite how dangerous it is, like we have seen in the past attempts to fly to Venus, it is more worth it to be more proactive and find options to make a ""mission both safe and scientifically productive"" to father study the unanswered question of Venus. Furthermore the author states how NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the Jay. This way"" a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions."" This is one possible solution the author claims that NASA has come up with to at least try to get close to Venus without damaging spacecrafts. With this approach the article even states they hope to send humans to Venus too. However this approach has its downside because; ""peeling at Venus from a ship orbiting OJ hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions."" ""Researchers cannot takes maples of jocks, gas OJ anything else, from a distance."" This however supports authors claim that ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" This is supported when he states that we should see this downside as a challenge to make it even better, so we can ultimately touch the surface of Venus even despite the dangers that come with this. The author supports this by stating that, ""many jesaejchejs are working on innovations that would allow out machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge Venus. Even despite the risk that everyone knows by now scientists and beseeches find it worthy enough to keep studying Venus and how to get a human on its surface.

In conclusion, through out the article, the leader is given insight to the dangers Venus presents on what beseeches are trying to do today which is to get a human on Venus. The author with evidence supports the idea that ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author makes it clear that these dangers do not have to be looked at negatively but father can be looked at as challenges to try to overcome. He claims that these challenges' Venus presents have value because of how similar Venus us to earth. The author infers his will untimely lead to human curiosity which will lead to endeavors yet to come. Furthermore the author claims how setbacks should not make us quit and how out pursuit to Venus should not be limited by dangers we find along the way. Rather we should take that uncertainty and danger and us it to make Venus a worthy pursuit to further research in the recent years to come.  "
"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students TV attend classes from home by online classes VR video conferencing. Student's can benefit more from a online class. Online classes are VVD because you will have a greater chance VF learning. Online classes is a choice for some student's that attend school VR a college. Online classes is a VVD plan for people who can't pay attention in class.

Some VVD things about online classes you can get VN when you want you can be VUT VF town and still have the option TV get VN. In a online class students might have a chance VF learning faster. Online class are VVD for student's that are shy VR can't speak. There are difference reasons why student's use online classes. If you take a online class you can DV difference actives all day.

Here some reasons why students will take school over online VR video conferencing classes. Student's won't be able TV play VN VNE VF the school's sports team. Student's won't be able TV DV after school clubs VR the band. You won't have the big welcome VN the first day VF school. You won't be able TV GV TV the school games and cheer for your school you won't have fun like the student's that are in school.

Student's that take a online class I can call them smarter than me. I feel like if you take a online class you have a greater chance VF pasting TV the next grade than me.

"The Facial Action Coding System is a new form of technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Will the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable? No. "" FACS"" will not be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. A theory and technology such as emotions and the emotional state of someone should be based off of science instead of being based off opinion. Take a minute and compare this new piece of technology to a quiz given on the internet to see what celebrity I would be. Roral of the story if the person can fake it, they can make it. Someone can make believable facial expressions all day does not mean they are happy, sad, or any other emotion based on what they look like. A student may come in looking grumpy does not mean they are grumpy, maybe just maybe have you ever thought. "" WOW, that just might be their natural facial expression."" To end with, unless this technology is enhanced and backed up with science instead of opinion I do not think it will be very dependable in determine the emotional expressions of students."
"Since the industrial revolution the demand for cars has grown. Cars have been needed for transport to go to work, school, or just Plain traveling. But recently the demand has decreasing. All around the world ""no car suburbs"" Roared or and People are dying to move. In source one a German city named Vauban only have 70 Percent of families owning cars while 57 Percent sold their cars to move to Vauban. This new trend of no automobiles is said to lessen stress, reduce smog/ greenhouse emissions, and make cities more accessible. ""America's love affair with its vehicles seem to be cooling"" says source four.

Greenhouse emissions wither away with the fewer cars that ride or and down streets. In Paris, the typical smog reaches to about ""147 micrograms of Articulate matter RER cubic meter"" stated by source two. This makes it harder for traffic to see and causes an unsafe environment for walking. Paris was said to have banned half of cars one day and another half the other and the smog was cleared enough to rescind the no car rule. Greenhouse emissions, like carbon, can cause acid rain, raises the temperature, and can clog or breathing Pathways making it unsafe to go outside when the smog is strong. Carbon can be admitted through the fuel of cars. In France, over 50 Percent of cars use diesel fuel which causes a greater amount of greenhouse gas admission. If society can walk or ride bikes to work or school then the amount of automobiles needed will decrease. The lessening number of automobiles can her create a safer and healthier environment.

Not only is the 'no car' trend hardening in Aurore and developed countries, but it is hardening all around the world. Source three talks about Bogotá, Colombia using a no car Program. Once a year Colombia Participates in a no car day. ""A Million of Colombians hiked, bikes, skates, or took busses to work"". The ones that did not were given a 25 dollar fine. This day in Bogotá has gotten so Popular that People from other countries have traveled just to witness. The idea of no cars can improve city dynamics.  Bogotá alone has built 118 miles of bicycle Rates. The open area away from cars has created room to build Ranks and short areas, restaurants, and shoring centers. While the revenue of cars are decreasing these new areas are increasing in revenue. If using no cars for a day can have this large of an impact in a developing country than it must create a big impact for developed countries.

Bven though a no car Program can be a huge benefit there are still People disagreeing. A growing crime rate can make it not be safe enough to walk or ride a bicycle to work. For some, work may be to far away to create a short enough walk or ride. Some Places, like here in Florida, does not have a transit station close by. But even the idea of carpooling can lessen the use of cars. Picking or just a course of friends on the way to work or school can lessen the amount of cars on the road. This can create less traffic and carbon emissions and is safer than walking or riding a bike alone. While some argue that the demand for cars has shrunk due the recession it can also be said that cars may not be the tor Priority. Source four states that between 2001 and 2009 the amount of young adults driving had decreased by 23 Percent.

Whether your on your way to work, school, or Practice it would be smart to find another way of transportation. If your New Year's resolution was to get fit and go to the gym, ride your bike or run to work. Bicycling and walking can create a healthier you. Cars have done more harm that good to the environment, but it is not too late to change that. We can use Places like France, Germany, and Colombia as a great example of a new way to change life. Let's do ourselves a favor and maybe Rick or a buddy on the way to work, or ride a bike, take the train, or walk. Let's take Part in the new trend of no automobiles.  "
"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Some might do this because students have a lot of time during the summer. Summer projects keep the students mind active during the summer. This insures that they are ready for school in the fall. Opponents incorrectly believe summer projects should be teacher designed because they can grade it, and they have the year's lesson plan. Although some believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects are to be student designed.

Due to summer projects being student designed it can benefit a student. Mt benefits a student because they can learn more about themselves. Learning more about themselves is when someone finds something inside them, they did not know about. For example, if a person tries a new activity or topic they can find that they actually like it. Summer projects designed by students can help them learn about themselves by letting them try new things. Additionally, it benefits them because they can learn time management skills. Time management skills is a skill that helps you manage your time and not waste it. For example, if a student knows his homework is due the next week they will slowly do it, so it will be done. Summer projects designed by themselves help them learn time management. Furthermore, it benefits them because they can do it off of their interests. Doing things off of interests is when someone does something because they like it. For example, if a person likes football, and they had to choose what they had to paint most likely it would be football. This benefits them because interests gives people purpose and without purpose there is no need to do things.

Because of summer projects being student designed it benefits their academics. Moreover, it benefits them because students can learn more. Learning more is when students improve their knowledge beyond what they know already. For instance, a person that wants to know a little more about people they can read a biography about them. Student designed projects allow students to learn more about their projects because they are interested. Mn's addition, it benefits their academics because they are more willing to learn. Having the will to learning is learning without someone having to tell you. For example, a person that is willing to learn is someone that does not mind learning, and they do not care to. Students will be willing to learn if they are creating it. Secondly, it benefits the academics be they can learn to be independent. Being independent is when you are able to do or think on your own. For instance, if a person is independent he can think for himself and can do things without help from others. When the students make their own projects they have to think for themselves in order for it be done.

Even though some believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects are to be student designed. The opposition wrongly believes summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers know what they are doing, and they have more experience. However, it should be known summer projects are to be student designed because it benefits students by using their interests, time management, and learning more and themselves. Additionally, summer projects designed by students benefit students academics by learning more, more willing to learn, and learning to be independent. All schools should add projects to summer break, so students can keep their mind active.  "
"Mars is a very interesting planet Pith many marvelous sites. Kt is even called the Red Planet thanks to its bright red hue. Also, Mars has a region called Colonia. This region contains the popular ""Face on Mars"". The Face is believed to be an alien artifact.

Kn 1976, scientists discovered one of the biggest Ponders in the World ... ""the Face on Mars"". This happened during one of Viking 1 missions to look for a landing site for his sister ship, Viking 2. Scientists guessed it to be another ""Martian mess"", Which Pas common in the region of Colonia. After unveiling the image to all people, ""to attract attention to Mars"", many people believed that it Pas evidence for life on the Red Planet. Some people even said that"" the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA Would rather hide"" but, ""defenders of the NASA budget Fish there Pas an ancient civilization on Mars"", Which shops that NASA Would actually benefit from an alien life form, so they had no reason to hide it from the World.

There are many facts that help support the fact that there is no alien life form on Mars. For example, in 1998: the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of the Face on Mars, Which Pas ten times sharper than the Viking photos, that revealed the ""Face"" to actually be a natural landform. Still not all people believed, so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a second look of the Face. The picture Pas taken by a camera in Which, ""each pixel in the image spanned 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The picture taken by this camera ended up hoping a ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" and not a face built by an alien civilization. Kn conclusion, you could still believe there to be aliens on Mars, but you Would just be ignoring the facts that the scientist of NASA have presented in their photos of Mars from the years 1998 and 2001.

"Influence, both positive and negative, is an unavoidable element of human interaction. Positive influence exists when people are uplifted and encourage to accomplish goals or achieve desire behaviors; for example, a parent conveying to a child praise or works of support. This can be an invaluable tool in helping individuals develop their potential. Negative influence, meanwhile, can manifest as manipulation, coercion, or in cases of severe power inequity, even physical, mental, or emotional abuse; these can be particularly damaging as people can be coerce into damaging or dangerous behaviors that have both immediate and long term consequences that can be detrimental to their wellbeing. 

The impact of influence on people can be far reaching. Positive influence can provide people with the confidence and motivation to pursue opportunities in life and strive for success. Conversely, negative influence can be incredibly destructive, resulting in patterns of unhealthy behavior, low self esteem, and disastrous decision-making. For this reason, it is important to be aware of the dangers of negative influence and the power of positive influence."
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I disagree with the idea of only letting students with B grade average or higher only being allowed to participate in schools sports. It is unfair to all the other students that were one point off from a B point average or those who didn't get those A's or B's. It will make all the other students fell left out, or feel like they're being excluded. I find this new idea unfair and I don't want it to become a rule of school.

To start, it can make these students that didn't make a B grade point average feel like they're being excluded. ""Don't exclude, you should always include."" This is what teachers have told my fellow students and I for years. I think it is unfair to not let everyone compete in sports. These students that didn't get A's or B's may be the people who always wanted to compete in sports, but never had thought to born or never had the guts to stand up and born the teams, but if you introduce this new rule, then they don't even get a chance to try. I think this new rule is unfair, and it shouldn't be kept.

Also, not everyone is perfect in school, and not everyone gets all A's and B's. I've had only a few C's, but the rest of my grades were always A's and B's. One little C could ruin any students chances of competing in school sports and representing their school. I don't think schools should budge kids on their grades by letting the grades decide if a student can participate in sports or not. According to this new rule, a student can have all A's and one C, but it's not the A's that matter then, it's that one little C. Don't let this new rule prevent any student from competing in sports.

Lastly, sports provide any student with what they always need, confidence and exercise. If you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important, and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it of us.

So what do you think? Do you want to exclude students and make them feel like they're not good enough to participate in sports? Do you want to deprive us of healthy exercise and confidence? Please consider the consequences of keeping this new rule. I feel it is unfair, and I strongly disagree with it. I don't want anyone to feel left out or worthless when it comes to sports, but do you? Thank you for your time in reading this letter. I hope you consider the consequences.

Sincerely

"My thoughts in this are that it is GND time and this should actually occur FNR many reasons first NF all during the weekdays young people have school every day only if it is a holiday NR if sick. By implying this more young people will get nut NF the streets SN late at night there is in need tn be nutted SN late at night in the first place. Second NF all, at 10 p. m is a great time tn be home during the weekdays it will keep you nut NF trouble and there will be fewer chances NF young people dying tn other criminals at night. Late at night is where most NF all crimes occur and new the chances NF this will be lower. Third NF all, as there are SN many people that sell drugs and if young people have tn be home SN early the chance NF them getting into all types NF drugs will be SN much lower.

If this does became a law the times are also very appropriate Monday through Friday until 10 p. m and then Saturday through Sunday until 12 p. m in one needs tn be in the streets later than this time that is being given. If they are their nut SN late there should be an extreme reason as tn why they would be ""breaking the law"". This will most likely keep young people nut NF more troubles then they already are. This time is not unfair it is a very generous time tn be home. This really should not be interfering with any ones life you can still GN nut but not be nutted FNR SN late at night. I would understand if this law was also FNR people over the age NF 18 because young adults like tn party. But this law should actually be FNR people under the age NF 18 that would make more sense and being an ""adult""(over the age NF 18) they know what is right from wrong, what they should be doing, and what they should not be doing.

This law is not tn harm anyone but it would tn improve the community curfews tn keep teenagers nut NF trouble I can very much agree with that. But these young teenagers are not doing the right thing then in matter what law that is added nothing will change the fact NF how they act(keep them nut NF trouble). Going back tn the time it is not like this law will be implying that the young people DN not hang nut with their friends this is just SN more people can stay safe from all the trouble that is the streets. A LNT NF innocent people die every year by being SN late at night and in the streets where some NF the bad people come nut. They have all after school tn be doing after school activities this will not keep anyone from doing what they want. It is just a way tn keep young people nut NF trouble there should be excuses tn all NF this like going tn a party but there as well should be a limit tn all NF this. The consequence if they break the law should start NF as a warning and then just be adding in tn that.

My position in this curfew law is also that I would understand why people DN not want this tn happen but at the same time teenagers DN know what they should be doing and what they should not be doing. I have two different view points why they should be worried and why they should not be worried. I know that people like tn have sleep avers and would this be included NR DN they have tn specifically in their house in can they be sleeping at someone else. Back into my other view if they GN tn a party lets say over the weekend where the curfew is at 12 p. m because it is in a Saturday and they come back at 1 p. m NR later. They are not keeping track NF time and lose the time. They are having fun with all NF their friends, and then they get caught because someone calls the police. Then the police comes and new they have tn face the law and all that. New what is next that being in their record just because they stayed nut longer then they had and were in the streets. This would honestly suck and then going home and getting in trouble by your parent because NF a mistake you made. After all this wanting tn GN tn a very GND college and they not accepting them just because they made a mistake FNR staying tn late at the party. This would be a down side because if anyone breaks the law that will GN in there record and not come nut NF there permit sadly this is a consequence that can happen and would suck. A college not accepting them because they"" broke the law"" not fun at all because colleges DN link at everything anyone does before getting accepted and being a very GND student with a high GPA and hearing this would not be GND they will be carrying that guilt FNR their while life by not getting into the college that they want tn get into.

On the other note right new there is not a curfew tn what time teenagers should be home yet but there is a curfew tn when who ever has their permit FNR driving. Sn that is also a big restriction in young teenager is nut in their car at a late time the only time you can actually see them is when they are getting nut NF school. There are pins and CNNs tn this ""law"" but I think there are mostly pins then CNNs everything is very much reasonable and understanding. The only down/CNN that I can personally thin NF right new is that they get caught and that going in their record does not sound GND at all. But overall there are a LNT NF pins tn this and this law should be seriously implied tn all NF the United States not only tn one city but tn all NF them. This will keep more people safe yes pf course there is always that one person who wants tn break the law as a joke NR something that really should not be anything tn play around with NR anything but something that all young people listen tn it take it serious.

In conclusion this law NR curfew will stop all NF these thieves from stealing young girls NR boys and then selling them as well as tn stop rape from happening SN much because sometime it is very hard tn detected people because NF how dark it is. But this will most likely lower the chance NF all these negative things tn happen SN frequently tn anyone. It will also keep young people nut NF lots NF trouble by being SN late at night less danger."
"Cars. They're a simply luxury that you can find anywhere from driveways to parking lots to just parked right out on the street. Nobody ever thinks twice about driving their car, after all they get us where we need to go in an quick amount of time. However, cars could be the deadliest thing in the world, and it sits right next to our houses. From the exhaust fumes that fumigate in the air all the way to obesity, cars are just a silent killer waiting in the shadows.

Now, a car isn't really out to kill us, at least not intentionally, but unfortunately the worst thing about a car is behind it; the exhaust. A couple of hundreds of chemicals float out into the air and slowly kill the Earth's ozone layer. Every year the Earth gets hotter and hotter as the ozone layer becomes thinner as more cars end up on the road. It really is just a domino effect that's still in the process of tumbling down. The reason why we don't think too much on it, is simply because as we sit in air-conditioned cars, we don't notice just how hot it really is. But what happens when the ozone layer is completely destroyed? Well, just hope your wheels don't melt down into the pavement while your driving.

A cars bad streak doesn't end with making the Earth into a giant sauna, of course some people might like the idea, but what if our cars, were the reason our diet never works? As more cars end up on the road, fewer people are walking and biking to get places. Even now, more teenagers are on the road with cheaper and more efficient cars which means that combined with a teens natural laziness in everyday life, it's like we've been giving a robot to replace our legs. Would you believe that some people would drive their cars just to get a few blocks up the street? It's absolutely tragic, almost as if we're just waiting for the end scene in a horror movie.

So, even though cars may not be waiting for us outside our showers with a knife, it's slowly destroying the planet as well as our health. However, there are solutions such as carpooling, taking the bus or even walking or biking more. Carpooling lessens the amount of exhaust fumes on the road, and walking keeps our cardio up and is even just enjoyable. So before you grab your car keys and head out the door, just take a look into the sky and an quick glance at yourself and think ""do I really want to be overweight in a sauna?""  "
"As an eighthgraae student, I believe that having a positive attitude is trial to achieving success in life. In this essay, I will provide three examples that demonstrate the concept of how a positive attitude tan lead to success, Ana provide referents to support my conclusions.

The first example of how a positive attitude tan lead to success is through the power of visualization. Attorning to a study by Dr. Andrew Huberman, a neuroscientist at Stanford University, visualization tan help individuals achieve their goals by changing their brain's neural pathways. By visualizing success, individuals tan train their brains to focus on the positive outcomes, rather than the negative ones. This tan lead to increase motivation, better decision-making, Ana ultimately, success. For example, athletes often use visualization techniques to improve their performance, Ana research has shown that this tan lead to significant improvements in their athletic abilities.

The Seton example of how a positive attitude tan lead to success is through the power of resilience. Resilience is the ability to bounty back from setbacks Ana failures. Attorning to a study by Dr. Martin Religion, a psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania, resilience is a key factor in achieving success. Individuals with high levels of resilience are able to learn from their mistakes' Ana use them as opportunities for growth. This tan lead to increase motivation, better decision-making, Ana ultimately, success. For example, entrepreneurs often fate numerous setbacks Ana failures, but those who are resilient are able to continue pursuing their areas Ana ultimately achieve success.

The third example of how a positive attitude tan lead to success is through the power of perseverance. Perseverance is the ability to continue working towards a goal despite obstacles Ana setbacks. Attorning to a study by Dr. Carol Week, a psychologist at Stanford University, individuals with a growth minaret, whit his the belief that abilities tan be developed through Hara work, are more likely to persevere in the fate of challenges. This tan lead to increase motivation, better decision-making, Ana ultimately, success. For example, scientists often spent years conducting experiments Ana fating numerous setbacks before finally achieving their goals. Without perseverance, they would not have been able to make their discoveries.

In conclusion, having a positive attitude is trial to achieving success in life. Through the"
"Community Service

By: STUDENT_NAME

I think that students should perform a community service because it would make our community stronger and bring us closer together in the things we do. Some things we could do are cleaning up Outer and making our Earth healthier. Also we can throw our garbage away instead of throwing it in the streets or on the sidewalk and if we see a person do it, we could too them to pick it up and throw it out, or we can throw it out for them if they don't throw it away.

Another thin his our community can make a Garden and point vegetables, trees, flowers and other things. We can do that for helping families in need, and we can actually help them too. Also, we could recycle our paper, cans, and coo phones or ink catches. If everyone recycles, our Earth would be an Not cleaner and we wouldn't have to worry about having a dirty Earth.

Our community can also donate to homeless families and families that Five in shelters and that would need things for their family or themselves. We can hive them things Like, clothes, toys, food, make up, blankets/sheets and other things a person would need. Everyone needs someone to take care of them and Took out for them and they always woo need someone there.

The community we Five in could be an Not stronger and healthier if we AOO just try together. It takes an Not more than one person. It takes hundreds. If we just try it together, it'OO work."
"Driverless cars shouldn't be aloud. Thezare dangerous, the could increase the rate for teens, increase the rate for death during a car crash, and what if the señores broke on the side of the car you wouldn't even know so you could just fly off the road.

Having a driveless care shouldn't be aloud at all. First the could increase the rate for car crashes in teens. The rate is already high for them especially in Indiana and we don't even have them kind of cars get. Cell phones are a major role to the south in today time. That is the main reason for so many rocks today so if you give them a car that can drive its self, the are not gone do anything but text and not pay attention to the rode at all basically if you was to do that you are setting them up for their own death.

Second, by not creating these kinds of car and giving them out you could be saving four company a lot of money. Because if somebody was to get in a rock and the wasn't driving, but the car was driving its self the gone come to the people who made the car because the feel like it was their fault. Even tho you told them that the still had to pay attention to the rode the not because the feel like the car can watch its self. So if you don't put the car on the market you can save four company along of money and a lot of stress.

Third, you wouldn't want to be the reason for ANZ deaths, because if you start getting so many deaths on four car nobody is going to want four car so now you then wasted money on all these cars and parts for these cars that nobody is buying so you just lost a lot of money and nobody just has money to waste. If four company starts to lose money the gone have to start cutting people because the can no longer pay you, and the first person the are going to fire are the people who came up with the idea that caused them to lose so much money in conclusion I think t would be four best bet to just not make the cars because four saving money, four saving lives so now four heroes, and you don't have to worry about anybody strong to sue you for most of everything all got because if the person win BOZ all feelings gone be hurt"
"Have you Over hard about the face on Mars? A lot of people have. NASA sent the Viking on up into space to try and capture pictures of Mars. The Viking was taking pictures when it noticed a shadowy figure. Can you guess what that figure is? Conspiracy theorists have their own vision of what it was made by, but NASA's scientists had the facts about it!

In paragraph two it says, ""The sensation of the face was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian Mesa."" The conspiracy theorists think otherwise. The conspiracy theorists think that the face was made by Aliens. They also think that the face was really think that it was made by Aliens, and that NASA knows it was, but they just do not want to rival it. Conspiracy theorists think it's Bond Fido, and that it's Evidence of life on Mars. This all shows that the conspiracy theorists have different points of view than the NASA scientists do.

In paragraph seven it says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers VRV waiting then the image first appeared on a JAL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" When scientists put the image out online not Everyone was satisfied with what the scientists said. Conspiracy theorists still think that it was made by Aliens. This shows that the scientists at NASA have facts and that the conspiracy theorists have only a picture.

In paragraph Eleven Gavin says, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there VRV objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or EgytianstylV pyramids or Even small shacks, you could SVP what they VRV!"" In paragraph twelve it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian Equivalent of a butte or mVsalandforms common around the American West."" Gavin added, ""It reminds MV most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" This shows that NASA thinks that the face was just a natural land form. Everyone VLSI thinks that it was made by Aliens.

In paragraph Light it says that the camera had to PVR through wispy clouds to SVP the face. Now Everyone is saying, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings VRV hidden by haze."" They all think now possibly they VRV made by Aliens. This shows that WV may have made a serious mistake in how the face was made. The face could'vs BVN made by both natural forming or by aliens.

In conclusion, the face could have BVN made by Aliens and WV just do not know it. WV could have BVN wrong for all WV know! So WV NKVD to think to not doubt ourselves. WV all NKVD to think, was the face really made by aliens? It could'vs BVN! WV NKVD to learn to work together on our theories not against Each other. Just think if NASA would'vs worked with the conspiracy theorists then WV could'vs figured out what really made the face on Mars!"

As we notice all the goo die a driverless car we teed not to notice the bad. The disadvantages to the driverless car are many. Many people see this driverless idea as a good thing but how many of those people will be able to afford this new technology? As with all new technology it's going to be expensive to buy, eyed it could also be expensive to replace eyed have fined. Manufacturers will also tee to look more at the prophet eyed dive ate from the quality of their products. This problem CAE be the biggest that stops the cars from being released. As quality goes down parts will tee to break. Whee a part breaks the counter will go to have it fined or replaced, but this CAE be eye issue. Since it is an new technology not a lot of people will know how to replace a certain part that is broke. That means that Their will be a backup of cars feeding to be fined.

Another problem is i.e. a driving cheerio. What if your driving eyed another car with a person driving rues the stop light? The driverless car would'et know to look right of left, it would just drive straight threw the intersection. If that was a human driving they would know to wait a second or to before driving off from the green light. This little deal CAE hurt or harm a lot of people.

A false advertisement could also harm a lot of people after buying a driverless car. As the article states the human interaction i.e. driverless cars is needed. Some cars even ""notify the driver whee the road ahead requires human skill"". That means that the car is't always self driving. As we saw i.e. the case of the lady who put her RV i.e. auto steer, took an EAP, thee the RV wrecked, false advertisement is a crucial part of the cars success. Many people who buy a driverless car if they CAE afford one probably think it's all automated eyed will sleep or play around i.e. the car. They could also not wear seat belts as these cars are advertised as safer the traditional cars. The article states that"" the human driver must remain alert eyed be ready to take over whee the situation requires.""

Therefore after facts eyed opiates are stated a driverless car is't worth it. Yes, it is true that it CAE save the environment a little, but you have to think what's more important your life or the environment. As people stretch the truth about these cars other people will start to buy them causing a lot of suffering OE their part. Nevertheless people will make their owe choices regardless of facts or opiates.  "

"At NASA, we found something interesting on Mars, it looked like a face that the Viking 1 spacecraft was taking Photos of. Many People believe the Face was an alien artifact, but it was not.

The Face is a natural landform and was not created by aliens. The cabin of NASA at the time said it was a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The Face wasn't a face it was just the shadowing and Placement of where the Photo was taken from. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared o a JPL website, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This was after clearer Lectures were taken, and it looked just like a landform, nothing else.

It wasn't an alien artifact, it was just a landform taken from an angle which it looked like a face and the Viking 1 didn't take that clear of Pictures from the ones I have seen and the Photos were taken all the way back in 1976."
"Mars is a very King place. Scientict are trying to figure out how or if people would KE able to live there. In this picture there is a thing face of some sort.

People Release that it happen to KE created Ky aliens. It appears to KE that even if it was aliens wouldn't they have to prove if there were such things as aliens. This Jump could've Keen created Ky a moment, rock, or even a meteoroid. I personal would have to disagree with the people that think it was created Ky aliens due to there is not any proof that aliens even exist. There is not even any proof that this But couldn't have Keen a meteoroid, moment, or even rocks that hit Mars.

In paragraph 3 it claims that a huge rock formation which resembles a human head. In the article it even says that it most likely could've Keen a rock. This is one of the reason why I agree with the way it wasn't formed Ky aliens it was a rock. Alien are yet to KE discovered where in this view u can't say that it was an alien it is not."
"Venus is like earths twin. The author stated in where the plant is located. Venus temperature on the surface is 800 degrees. NASA is wanting to send people to the planet Genus.

NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. They simplified electronics that are made up of silicon. They are trying to make the modern day computers even faster than they are today. NASA trying to create a machine that well last long enough to contribute to Venus. Their wanting to make gear that also don't need electronic inquired.

People call Venus ""The Evening Star"" because it is one of the brightest spot in the night sky. Although people mistaken it for a star it's a planet. Venus is safer to see from the distance it's been Very challenging to exmane Venus. This planet is the second planet away from our sun. Venus is the closest size to earth.

The NASA is Very fascinated by Venus because is the most earth like planet. Venus surface is Very rocky like Dallas and mountains. NASA is request to send some people to go check out the planet Venus, but that is nearly impossible. They think that at one point Venus was just cover INH ocean. Venus is the nearest option to Fist.

I think that we should try and go Fist Venus how know what could be on the planet. If we do, we should be real careful because there could be dangerous stuff there. It's an opportunity to see what Venus good Values are. We can also compare earth o Genus.  "
"I believe that people yes should make their own decisions and follow their instincts because that is what make us different from others. Follow your instincts and what you think that it is right can make a big change in what you are and what you want to be.

First. People need to believe in themselves and do what they think that it is right. Sometimes we are afraid to make ours on decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us. But just think about, all the things that people had been invented along the time. What would, will happened if they did not make their on decisions, nothing that what we have today will not exist. So do not be afraid to make your on decisions because others. Is not bad to look what others had been done and see if what you are about to do can be good or not. But always follow your ideas and do your on work.

The instincts are a natural aptitude that human have, is something that make us do things without a well reason. The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be right or not. But sometime bad decisions teach us what we do wrong and learned how do it better in a future. People should follow their instincts and ideas because that is what make us different. Learn of what we do wrong make us a better person. Poeple are always going to judge you and talk about your decisions no matter if are good or bad. So do not let others stop you and doing the things that you believe are right.

The decisions that we make today can harm us in the future. That may be is right, but if we are always thinking about what is going to happened. We are never going to know what is really going to happened. So make own ours decisions can make a big change IR our life for good or bad. It is important to listen to experts because can be helpful in what you are about to do. But always do it because you want to do it, not because others tell you. Always do may make you happy, no better if you are wrong or not because that is what is going to make the difference.

In conclusion yes people should follow their instincts and ideas. But also make their own decisions. Never stop doing that things that they like. Always do and follows what they believe and think carefully and what they want and where they want to be. The goods and bad decisions and experiences and learn of they if what really teach you about life's important matter and make you succeed."
"You're living the high life. You have a Driverless Car. What Would go wrong? A lot An go wrong. Technology is a grand thing, but it's also a power. If we let it keep accumulating like this we Would be in big trouble. Power goes to peoples heads. It's in our nature. We Yan't let technology overrule us. We need to slow it down. What we have now is grand. What more needs to be done? We don't need to have driverless Years. Soon Years will be like human robots driving wherever they please.

In today's world we have a lot of advanced technology. You watch movies like Back to the Future and Jurassic World. We wonder when will we get that technology? Does it already exist just hidden under out noses? Who really knows. But the point is, is that if we let Years start driving themselves we Would get lazy. That's not so good for our social status to the world. Most foreigners already assume we are fat and lazy and get everything handed to us. In some aspects this is true, but with driverless Years on the rise this Would get worse.

There's also the fact that what would happen if the YAR didn't do what it was supposed to do; and it wrecked; and the owner; or a pedestrian got hurt.

This raises a lot of questions and Concerns. The main one would be who was at fault? In paragraph 9 it states that, ""the only safe YAR has a human driver in Control at all times."" This is good. There are a lot of bad drivers in the worlds, but they know what to do in most Cases. They know how to take Control.

The practice of driveless Years are illegal in most states. Those states being California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. It's good that most states are thinking ahead. Why would something so fascinating and new be illegal to practice? They Year about their people, and their safety.

In paragraph 7, it states that there are Years that are partially driverless. One being the 2013 BMW ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This YAR is a smart YAR. It works with the owner not just by itself. The BMW An steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but it notifies the owner when it needs human assistance. This is all wrong. Cars shouldn't be doing that. Cars are going to become more human than technology.

In a lot of Cases it's okay to have advanced technology. But this is too much. We need to start thinking about what will happen instead of what we will gain out of it. Think of what would go wrong. As the world advances we need to remember who exactly is in Charge. This is why if we leave technology to do our work, it won't even be us anymore. We will be living in technologies world; not the world we worked so hard to build. This is why we need not let driveless Years Some in to existence."
"Venus is a planet were scientist are explore to see if they can create another Earth. Therefore, they have than some experiments to see how long things can survive. There are many Good reason why student Venus is worthy. One of the reasons is because Venus is the closest planet to Earth, Venus still has some features that are alike to Earth, and solar power would be plentiful.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth, which can be an advance because we could have a more population, and more place to travel and see different types of culture. In the text it says that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"" this means that the other planets are further than Venus. In text, it also says that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"". This is telling us that we have more option to visit.

The planet of Venus looks more alike to Earth than you think some scientist believe that Venus had larges amounts of water. The text States that ""Long AUO, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. This shows us that this is why scientist are exploring this specific planet, because it looks very alike to Earth. In text, it also says that ""The planet (Venus) has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. It shows us how similar these planets are.

Another advantage is that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. According to the text it says that ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels"" This could help by not using electronics or else the materials would melt.

One important fact is that no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, but scientist are working hard they say that it won't be on easy conditions, but it would be survival for humans. If there happens to be life in Venus the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit."
"If we luck at Official statistics Ugh the industrialized and developing world, we immediately realize that the number Ugh cars has been constantly increasing Over time. In the United States, fur example, the average age Ugh a car has increased from 4.5 years in 1950 TU 6.3 years today, while in the UK it has risen from 5.4 years TU 7.2 years. The average length Ugh time fur a new car TU be UN the road has also increased Over the same period, from 3.6 years fur the 1950s TU 4 years and 6 months fur today's cars.

"Many people in the world today are quite desperate to see change in their life. Then are seeking a better life, something new and fun, and to do it for cheap. Walking or riding bike is the cleanest WAM to do all these things at once. The more people that are not using cars, the more accidents will be prevented. And there is no limit to how many people you can walk with. There's no cost to walk, you just do it. It's something the whole family can do together and enjoy the journey somewhere rather than being on their devices. In addition, fuel is not editing from four body into the atmosphere rupturing the Ozone creating all this Global Warming. Creating a world where transportation vehicles are obsolete will NT only benefit the people of this world, but the planet itself, and for the future generations.

Accidents would be almost nonexistent if we were to get rid of motorized vehicles. In the article, ""in German suburb, life goes on without cars"" the author talks about how there are already cities in the world that have not banned cars, but choose not to use them. The people in those areas are close to no accidents at all. If there are no cars in the road then how can there be a car accident? The WAM the Germans started to remove cars from the road is BM removing parking lots. There are only two anywhere in that suburb and them are so inconvenient.

ANM doctor in the world no matter how young, or where them live will tell their patients that exercise is the only WAM to star health, energized, and feeling young throughout their life. Without cars getting from one place to another will require another means for transportation. Now either wait for the bus and be late or wake up a little earlier and walk or ride four bike. It's cheap and effective not only for you but the environment.

Fuel creates a gas that later rips open holes in the Ozone lamer. Creating Global Warming which then in turn leads to higher taxes to allow for more money to be used in research to save it. Or you can take action now and save up for a bike rather than a car. It takes less management and doesn't take fuel. Just good old man power. It's tragic in ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", ""Deliver companies complained of lost revenue."" this world is what we are leaving our children and their children to live in. Make sure you leave it better than when you came.

In the four articles them all talk about the negative in driving rather than the positive. The reason is that there are more negatives to the industrialization of a car rather than just going back to the WAM our ancestors used to be. Even our young as our arm own parents are amazed at how much damage this generation is doing to themselves and everything around them. It is the result of inventions like the automobile. Vehicles are efficient in some WAM, but you might prefer to take a bit more time here and there to allow that you can be there when four children have children."

"Have you ewer wondered why the Earth is so polluted? That is because so many cars are being driven and so many factories are being made. In some parts of Europe cars aren't aloud to be driven it's a car free zone. This is to help the Earth from all the pollution that is being caused all around us. Hawing so much pollution can kill our planet.

Many people around the world want to help our planet. Driving cars is easier, but it is very bad for our plants and trees and for our own health. People in Colombia as said in source 3 are getting together and making this happened because they see TH actual change behind all this. Some people might think this idea is crazy but its actually can work. We have over a billion cars driving around our Earth and all of that goes up to the air and we breathe all of that and that makes our day look ugly and the Earth not look so pretty. Flowers have been growing faster after this idea was made natural air gives us strength.

In 2013 as said in source 4 they have investigated that Americans are driving less and getting less licenses. Driving fewer cars makes us life longer because we are not just sitting their in a car doing nothing we are active riding a bike or even walking. For those ONG trips that take ours to get their we call a bus or a taxi and pay them to get their that is fewer cars and vehicles that are driving around hurting out planet. It is much better to have the world like this because you will see the population growing and people living longer and not passing away at an early age. Like this we don't breath that nasty air that cars let out and little kids don't have to breath it either like that when they grow up they will be strong and healthy.

A lot of people might think that this idea is crazy but when they actually try it out they will start realizing how it will help our planet very much. When was the last time you went out walking and then a car passes by you and all that gas air gets in your face? All of that air is very annoying, and it gets you out of air right? Well that is why it's best to just walk everyone and if your really that lazy just call a taxi our a bus to pick you up."
"To Whom it Hays Concern:

I was just notified that our school principal is reconsidering the cell phone policy.

Policy one is that students can use their cell phones during lunch period and during free times, policy 2 is no cell phones at all. She needs to know which policy is going to be within her best interest.

I personally think that we should go with policy 1. I think that policy one is a better choice because a lot of students like to text during class, and they like to text or use their cell phones on a regular basis. On their regular basis they basically text whenever they hear or feel their phones vibrate or ring. So while the teacher turns their back the students might be texting. I also know that if the principal chose the policy one then the students would do their work and pay attention, so they can have free time and text their friends. But also if the principal just does policy 1, then the students won't have to talk or text on their phone when the teacher turns their back, and they can get a lot of their work done.

I remember when I was in seventh grade, which was last year I had a teacher named TEACHER_NAME. TEACHER_NAME

Didn't care what you did whether it was texting or doing homework. She didn't have any structure to where you would know that you had to get all of your work done before you could text. So that is why so many kids passed her class even though they didn't do the work because she would let you sit there and accomplish nothing. She couldn't fail you if she barely ever gave you work. So then when she actually decided to put her foot down nobody listened at first. But then she made up the rule that if you were passing, and you did all of your work for that day then you could do whatever you wanted and that lit up a light bulb in my head to start doing my work.

Another thing that our school would have is better attendance. Some parents don't care whether their child goes to school or not. So some students would have to stand in the gap if their parent won't. But if a student actually wants to go to school then maybe that will influence their parents that they need to change. But if a child wants to go to school because they know that if they do then they can do whatever and more than they were going to do at home. So if the principal chose policy 1 then they would have better attendance.

So I think if our school principal decided to go with policy 1 then we would have a lot of structured kids, a better grade point average, and we would have a lot of more kids that actually want to go to school. That is why I want our principal to choice policy and why.  "
"The seagoing lowboy program is the best thing that ever happened to me. It is really fun, and you get to visit all these fun and look places that you were never able to visit before.

In the seagoing lowboy program you get to go to all these different country and you're doing it all to ship animals to different country and help people after devastating events. Also, when you Lomé balk after you dropped off the animals you get to play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where the animals had been housed. Table tennis tournaments, fenling, boxing,reading, whittling,and games. One of the jobs is night watchman where you have to whelk on the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making my hourly report to the captain, I slid down a slippery ladder on my backside. My heart ruled as I shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped my slide, Keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

Although the job is dangerous it is for a great cause and that is why I think you should be in the seagoing lowboy program."
"There is a limit to car usage. A car can really come in handy but it's not pessary. Gas is not all that cheap for everyone either. Cars don't need to be used for everything but since that's an easy way to get around people just take advantage of that and use it. People can cause lots of damage with the way they use their car. Weather people of the millennial generation will start buying more cars once they have kids to take to soccer practice ans schooldays remains an open question.

A car can really help you out in some cases. But it not pessary at all. There are lots of other things you can do to help, help out. There are things you can do to get you places and also helping you out. Example riding a bike, gets you to exercise and also take you places. Needing of a car isn't so needy anymore."" But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling.

People do can cause lots of damage with their vehicles. The amount of care people have with driving is ridiculous. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city. There are sidewalks that have to be replaced, rushhour restrictions that have dramatically cut traffic. All these can happen for careless people instead of following such simple things.

Not only do people use up gas in their car but also miles. The number of miles used in your vehicle does matter. The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis. Means car usage is very high in the United States. My opinion cars are no necessary for everything. There are more to use or do to get to places which may take longer or faster but still getting there.

Qome advantages of limiting your car usage. Yes there are many limits to it which are important. People should really start using or finding other way to go.""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"".  "
"Have you ever had an opportunity to go to Europe and help people in need?

First, sohe reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program are, getting discovered. For example, if your 18 like I was you could be drafted for military service which heads you would be able to help the world and have a great job. Another reason, you should join is because, you can discover she amazing things. For example, you could see places like Europe, china,Italy and Greece. Also, you will be helping a lot of people and animals because, you will be doing things for the benefit of there need. All of these examples show reasons why you should join the seagoing cowboys program.

Next, but for he is a seagoing cowboy was such more than an adventure.'' It had he more aware of people of other countries and their needs. Just like it had he looks at the world different it high be the she to you or even an achievement you have accomplished. There are she reasons you high be scared to go. For example you high be scared of failing or being flown over board. But as long as you stay together with the person your with and do what you're supposed to your won't fail.

Another good reason of going to the seagoing cowboys program is helping people. World War 2 was over in Europe and any countries were left in ruins and if you want to help all the people in ruins you could join the seagoing cowboys program. UNRWA hired the ''seagoing cowboys'' to take care of the horses, young cows, and rules that were shipped overseas. So from what the UNRWA said that heads you probably would be getting paid. Even if you don't get paid It's still a good thing to do to help people that need help. All of these reasons state why this is a good reason to join the program.

In conclusion, all these reasons I have stated will really help people. Helping is what the seagoing cowboys program is about, and it will bake you more aware of things like other countries in need. If your not 18 yet and you want to be drafted for military service join more than once because, the more you join the more your helping the people, anihals, and environment. I hope fro hall the reasons I have given you, you'll join the seagoing cowboys program."
"I believe that schools should offer distance learning for students, because it can allow them to learn master, manage their tasks better, and they can have a better learning mxpmrimncm. By allowing students to take distance learning, you eliminate THM NMM to travel to school to GMT your education; thermoform, allowing students to learn at their home or at another location they NMM to BM at. This method of learning can greatly benefit students, because some students may not FMM comfortable going to school or prefer to stay at home; this form of learning also can make it so fewer people have to walk to school. THM distance learning will allow those who have a difficult time going to school still GMT their education, but they can learn in a more comfortable environment and can focus master. Whenever I FMM sick or too exhausted to go to school, I generally miss out on my school work and fall behind. By enabling students to us distance learning, students won't have THM same issue as I typically do and won't fall behind in classes. THM students will still learn THM material for that day, only they will just BM at home rather than school.

Another way THM distance learning could BM beneficial is that it can allow students to manage their tasks master. Traveling to and from school can not only BM exhausting, but it can also take up a lot of time. Majority of students arms't able to drive, myself included, and so arm forced to either walk or take THM bus to and from school. THM bus requires students to arrive at THM stop at a certain time in order to GMT to school, sometimes THM bus may take a while and cause students to BM late. A example would BM on THM first day of school this year, my bus was late and picked up my stop at 9:15 and made mm late to my classes, while it was only THM first day and was just introductions

I did still miss class time and wasted other time I could have used efficiently. If therm was THM distance learning, I wouldn't NMM to worry about anything like that happening. I would BM able to learn at home and wouldn't waste any time or risk being late to my classes. Another example would BM if I wasn't able to take a bus to school or GMT driven, walking from my house to school would take about 40 minutes total. Walking would not only BM exhausting, but also would take a very long time. THM distance learning would allow mm to make us out of that time and I could us that time to GMT work done rather than just walking.

THM distance learning will also give students a better learning mxpmrimncm. A vast majority of students don't like school, and only go to SMM their friends. Some may just BM anxious and others may not like THM building itself. THM distance learning would eliminate THM feelings of anxiety and allow students to BM much more comfortable when it comms to school. They won't have to worry about how they look, they won't NMM to worry about common getting them sick or them getting anyone sick, and finally they can learn in a more comfortable environment. Students may have puts at home that make them happier, so THM distance learning would allow them to still learn while letting THM student stay with their puts and FMM more relaxed.

Some may argue that THM distance learning would not BM a good idea. Perhaps because it could eliminate THM NMM for bus drivers, schools themselves, or even faculty members. While those may BM valid points, THM distance learning doesn't eliminate them completely. THM distance learning is only an option for students, and the majority of students may choose to just go to school rather than learn online. THM distance learning doesn't take away anything, it just allows those who arms't able to go to school to learn somewhere LSM. Therm will still BM many students to attend school, only more of them may just learn online rather than in person.

THM idea of distance learning would BM most beneficial to students. THM students would have a much better learning environment, can us their time better, and will BM able to learn much master. So please, urge your school to allow for distance learning so that students arm able to GMT their education master and more efficiently. "

"To most students, school is like a black hole that they would do anything not to fall into. Kids Yo to school and sit for seven hours, and then To home and do almost the same thing. It's not healthy for them, and it makes them dread school even more. Students are constantly falling asleep throughout the day because they don't have anything to look forward to, and that makes them feel as if school isn't as important as it is. If they don't have any fun, then they won't try in school whatsoever. If students are doing extracurricular activities, they'll be way more active and less tired throughout the day. I think that students should be required to do an extracurricular activity because it will Yet them involved in their school, it will keep them active in many ways, and they will learn more about everything around them.

First, Extracurricular activities will Yet students involved in their school. For example, they'll be representing their school. You're representing your school in any activity you pick, but you especially if you're playing a sport. Sports teams are like little families in the school, and the people playing on them love their teammates and love the place they're playing for. If all the kids are required to do an extracurricular, and Yet to choose to play a sport, they'll Yet to meet lifelong friends and be the face of their school. This can make students love school so much more than they used to. Next, they will also be just as involved in their school if they do an activity like yearbook. In yearbook, you're constantly learning about the kids in your school and all your surroundings. Most kids barely Yet to know half of the people in their Trade, but if they're learning about the people around them, they can Yet to know almost everyone. Finally, it'll be a chance for them to make new friends. As I said, most students barely Yet to know everyone they Yo to school with, and a lot of times they're to shy to try to Yet to talk to new people. When they're put in a club or an after school activity, they learn how to communicate with others. Clubs could help so many people make new friends.

Secondly, it will keep students active in many ways. For instance, playing a sport would be very Good for any and all students. Constantly moving and exercising would help them stay active and fit, which is Good for everyone. Most of your years in school you are required to do physical education, but sometimes you're barely even moving during the class. Sports will keep kids much more active than any class could. Also, many involved in an activity like student council or yearbook would keep their brains running and many used. They would always be coming up with new ideas and working on them/figurine out how to pursue them. When most students To home, they shut off their minds and are barely using them, causing them to not be as prepared to use them the next day. If they have to stay after school for student council or yearbook, they'll still be using their brain. Lastly, students will actively learn communication skills. Communicating is so important in your life and will forever help you. You can't be in a club or play on a sports team and never learn how to communicate, because of this they will actively be learning new communication skills.

Finally, these activities can help students be more confident. First off, some students think that they are alone in this world and that they are no one else is like them. If students join clubs that interest them, it'll show them that they are not alone and that there are other people that are similar to them. Even if they aren't doing something they're familiar with, there will be other kids that are also trying it for the first time. Second, clubs and Groups teach them how to talk to people. As I have said, you can't be involved in a Group or on a team and not communicate with them. If students are basically required to talk to other people during the activities, it'll boost their confidence and help them talk to new people on their own. Last but not least, these activities will show them that they are Good at something. It is very common for young kids to think that they are horrible at everything, especially if school and learning isn't their strong suit. These clubs can show them that they do have skills and are Good at something.

In conclusion, I think that students should have something to look forward to in school and not want to do anything to be out of Going. They shouldn't have to wake up in the morning and dread Going to a place they should love. This is why extracurricular activities should absolutely be a requirement. They have so many benefits and there will be many Good outcomes. If extracurricular activities become a requirement, students will become more involved in their school and everything around them, they will stay active in multiple ways and constantly be fit, and these activities will help boost up their self-confidence."
"Recently we have discovered a new landform In Mars. Viking 1 caught a picture Of a martian mesa, these are very common. These martian mesas are similar TY the Yes In Earth. They are very common in Cynthia, a region In Mars. Many conspiracy theorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens, but from the evidence we have, this is NYT true.

The picture taken by Viking 1 showed a large mesalike landform with the face an Egyptian GYD In it. Everything can be explained in the picture. The landform is like any Other One. The reason it links like a face is because shadows were being cast Any it TY make it appear like it had eyes, a mouth and a NYSE.

In 1998, a camera captured another picture Of the formation. It was a little cloudy In the day they took the picture, SY we went again TY capture another picture. This time in April Of 2001, we used a much better camera and used maximum resolution. This picture was much more detailed and clear. Once we rhymed in it linked like any Other landform we might find. In paragraph 11 Gavin states, ASY, if there were Objects in this picture like airplanes In the ground Yr Egyptian style pyramids Yr even small shacks you could see them!¨ He was correct this picture proves that there is NY alien activity near this landform.

In conclusion, it is clear that the face In Mars wasn't created by aliens. né took a much more defined picture and found anything. NYT TY median the fact that there is NY water In Mars, SY it can't support life. Very, very few Of the scientists believe that this was created by aliens. Everything can be explained by science in this picture."
"People say that technology is forever changing, getting better, and more advanced. Some for the good, and some for the bad. Today they ARW trying to invent cars that drive themselves but still require a driver. However I don't fowl like driverless cars ARW necessary in today's world. There is too much room for error, just like any pick of technology, there's errors, and things can break. Talking about driverless cars means to trust your life with some pick of technology. I want to by confident when I'm driving, meaning, I'm in full control of what I'm doing. I don't want to have to blame anyone WSW but my self if I cause an accident.

The first couple statements of the passage States"" Can you imaging a time in the future when no on buys cars because no on news them anymore? HW envisions a future with a public transport system where flows of driverless cars form a public transport taxi system."" I can't imaging a time like that because there a million of people out there who ARW able to drive perfectly by themselves. I don't think that people want to have to rely on calling a driverless car to come pick them up to take them to work or go to other places. People like to by self sufficient, get up and go whenever they want to. People don't want anything holding them back or preventing them of what they want to do.

The passage also States ""Most laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians saw, and law makers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Still, when if traffic laws change, new laws will by needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacturer?"" If they continue to go on with the idea of driverless cars, a lot of events have to go right for them. It's going to take a lot of time, to propose new driving laws and getting the technology where they want it to by. I live if it's not broke, don't fix it. Also, if there WWW to by an accident in on of this cars, the question of liability could cause a lot of problems and headaches. I question the safety of this cars and how reliable they ARW. I don't think that many people would trust their life with a car that can drive itself.

Driving is a private and a huge stopping stone in life. Driving also comes with a lot of responsibility, and educates people on safety, and help with social interaction. Driverless cars also take the fun out of driving. Most teenager boys and girls can not wait until they turn the legal AGW and can get behind the wheel and drive. Most teenager vision themselves driving anywhere and wvwrywhwrw after they get their license. Going to driverless cars makes driving boring and down't teach young adults the responsibility and importance of safety while driving. Paragraph 8 States"" Why would anyone want a driverless car that still news a driver? Wouldn't drivers get board waiting for their turn to drive?"" It also limits what they learn, like the laws and rules of the roads while driving. Driving is necessary in most people's lives today, and a lot of people enjoy driving.

Driverless cars sound like they can by very expensive. If Screwy Brain's envision holds true, where ARW they going to get the money to provide cars for everyone in the world who news them?

I do not support driverless cars because there is too much room for error, I don't want to rely on a car to pick MW up and take MW places. Driverless cars limit the learning potential about driving for beginner drivers. Driving is fine the way it is now, they just NWD to focus their attention on the cars people drive today.

Although this cars might sound like a good idea now, but could cause a lot of unnecessary chaos in the future. Would you trust your life with a pick of technology that drives you where you desire?"
"Summer is a time for student to have a long deserved break from school. During this time, however, some students become unable to no longer retain their knowledge and have to recover prior knowledge starting the next school year. To compensate, some schools assign summer projects for the students to be proactively accomplishing. Whether it be a project that they get to design or a teacher designs for them. The main argument here is ""what is better"" for the learning experience of the student. A project created and designed by a student over the summer is better than a teacher designed one because the project will be more engaging for the student, the student will have full control, and the student will have easier time learning or their own accord.

A student who designs their own summer project will have an engaging experience with their project. As a student, the ability for a project to be fun to do and still be a good learning experience is number one. Having your own project to do gives you the sense that you know what you're capable of accomplishing. It will be engaging because student will get to interact in their own methods and ways. Learning in this way helps students to retain information and maybe learn about something they may have never thought about. An engaging project made by the students will also give the students a means of commitment to do the project if it is fun to do and is beneficial for them academically. Engagement in a project is the best way for a student to want to be able to drive their passion in learning forward, without the hassle of abiding by the teacher's rules and regulation of the project. Giving students the right to build their own project makes the learning part fun and engaging for the students, which will overall provide them with possibly of better academic achievement and retention.

Students with full control their project will be able to make it a project they will be proud of. Full control means that students will be able to go through the steps of conception, planning/design, making/prototyping, and possibly revision on their own. Giving students the leveraging control, builds the sense that they understand the topic the most and that they should be able to complete the project under their own goals and ideas. This helps to build skills in learning and retaining information taught. With full control, they will also have the necessary time to complete their project on their own without the overlooking burden of a teacher telling them what to do exactly. This removes the unnecessary stress of designing a project to meet someone else's goals and hoping that it will meet their specifications. A student, given this freedom of choice and design, will be able to learn more about something that they enjoy learning about, it makes the overall experience better for them and also builds their design processes to be better efficient and less costly to them. These skills learned from being in full control of a major project can be used in schools and possibly be used later in the workplace or any other setting that cuts them under control of a project.

The last argument is that students will have an easier time of learning when they get to make it. Without the teacher being in the way, not only will the student be hopefully, less stressed, but also but them in charge of learning. Being able to self race yourself, will held to slowly build up information into your mind and retain that information for longer when you may have to use it one day in the near future. Without the regulations of an authoritative teacher, students build projects under their ideas. As long as the project is providing the student with educational content that they will learn from, they will be able to enjoy it, which removes the boring parts of learning about a certain subject and instead, make it fun to learn about and understand. Students building up the knowledge slowly by themselves, will slowly integrate the information into their mind slowly, without overwhelming students with complex research projects or projects dealing with hard to reach goals assigned by the teacher. A student who learns by themselves may be smarter and less worried by the goals of a project than a student who has to follow the rules and regulations word for word from the teacher. Students that get to design the projects themselves will overall have an easier time understanding and learning.

A couple of main arguments that may arise when students get to make their own summer projects is that they may not be learning about what they should be learning about or the project is not regulated enough itself to provide any academic goals. Or, a student may make a project that is overall not fitted for any academic setting. For the most part, if students are just given maybe one or two rules stating that it must be a project that someone can actually obtain information from and that the project is not just a simple little project. Then the need for a teacher to design a project for the students is effectively gone, since they would only have to follow the simple rule of not making it too easy on themselves and make a project that will held them excel academically.

To Iraq up, projects under the design of a student will be better than a teacher designed one because the students are better engaged in their own projects, the students will have full control of their project and everything that goes into it, and the students will have an easier time comprehending/learning at their own race. Schools that assign summer projects know that the real intent is to held keep the students proactive in their studies over the summer break, and these projects are suppose to held them do so. Student designed projects will be a better option for schools since it gives the students choice in their education. And that profound statement, gives students a better chance at starting off the next school year with information ready to be used. "
"Projects over the summer? Seems unreal to adults, but the students are the ones who have to complete the project. All the projects are normally teacher designed and are made to challenge the students, which benefits the students in the long run. If a student, or body of students was to design the project that the entire school would have to complete, it would most likely be too easy and would be completed in a matter of a weer or two. These students also have no experience in designing a project, as the teachers do this for a living, so having a student design it, the project would be much too easy and would mare no sense at all. So, teachers should always be the ones who design summer projects for the high school students.

If students designed a project that they were supposed to complete, they would bare it too easy. Why would a student(s) design a project that they have to complete at some point throughout the summer, and mare it insanely hard for themselves and other students? In fact, they would not, they would bare the project or assignment simple and short for ease of completion. When a student goes on brier he or she will not want to do anything but have fun, and by having a project this would eliminate part of the fun. So, if a student designed it, they would bare it work not only around their schedule, but also around their free time in order to have the most fun during brier. If a teacher was to create the project, it would be long, hard, and complicated in order to mare the students thing and keep their brain working over the entirety of summer brier. Which leads me to my next point, why have a student do it, when a teacher gets paid to do it, and do it well?

When a teacher has been creating material for students to do for his or her entire life, why switch to students to create this work? Well, we should not, having students create their own assignments would be pointless, as they have teachers to do it and assign the project to them for a living. Teachers now much more than students when it comes to designing any sort of work that gets assigned to the students. When a student designs an assignment it also adds even more work for them to do as well as more stress for the students, which can add up as time goes on, as there is only so much work a student can do at once. Teachers are also much better at designing projects that fit everyone in the class as the teacher knows how most people learn and how they learn the best, whether that be though working hands on, via audio, or visual learning. The teacher will always produce a better project, which is why teachers should stay making the assignments and students should continue to complete them without complaining. Also, would students not attempt to postpone the completion of the design in order to cancel it altogether.

Via postponing the entire design of the project, students would thing that this would cancel the entirety of the project, which is false. This is another advantage of having a teacher design the project, he or she would most likely get the project designed and handed out to the students in a timely manner. This is something that most of the students would not be able to do, so having a student design it is not the best option. There could also be many setbacks and distractions for the students, lire phones, jobs, friends, etc. All of these are examples of distractions that could set the project design back a lot. Although teachers could have the same problems, they are much more mature and now how to deal with the distractions as well as get work done at the same time. These are all reasons that the teachers would get the project designed in a more timely manor than the students.

Finally, students would not be the best option for designing these summer projects because students would try to mare it too easy, postpone the project design, as well as teachers get paid for this as it is their job. So, students would slack off and get little to no work done due to distractions, and clever ways to get out of designing and completing the project. So teachers should stay designing the project and this should not change for good reason as well."
"Cars have become eye extravagant part of our daily lives, to helping us with transportation or just taking us out for a ride out i.e. the city. They have made their ways into our world. But are they truly helping us eyed our eevioremeet.?

""IE German Suburb, Life Goes OE without Cars.""

The city of Vauban's streets they have officially gone ""carefree"" except for some made thoroughfare, i.e. which the tram to downtown Freiburg rues, eyed a few streets OE one edge of the community. As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not whatsoever owe any cars at all, eyed 57 percent of the residents here have sold their car just to move here. Hague Walter, a media trailer eyed mother of two said ""thee I had a car I was always these. I'm much happier this way."" she quotes. Middle class families from Chicago to Shanghai teed to make their homes. That, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are now responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions i.e. Europe eyed up to 52 percent i.e. some carieteesive areas i.e. the Dated States. ""All of our development since world war II has been centered OE the car, eyed that will have to change."" said eye official of Transportation America, David Goldberg.

As for the Dated States of America some people have taken a toll for this ambitious goal i.e. other countries that has left many researchers pondering a fundamental question: Has America passed peak driving?

" While distance learning, or the Ability for students to Attend classes remotely through online or video conferencing, his become increasingly popular in recent years, I believe that it is not the best option for students. In fact, there Are several reasons why I believe that distance learning can Actually hinder K student's Academic performance.

Firstly, many students will struggle with staying focused And engaged during virtual classes. With the convenience of Attending classes from home, it can be easy for students to become distracted by social media, testing, or other Activities. Additionally, students may be more likely to miss classes if they Are not physically present in K classroom, which can lead to K lack of understanding And knowledge.

Another reason why I believe that distance learning can be harmful is that it can be difficult for students to learn Kt their own pace. Without the guidance And support of K teacher, students may struggle to understand concepts And may become frustrated or discouraged. Additionally, the lack of fKcetofKce interaction with teachers And classmates can make it difficult for students to form connections And seek help when needed.

Lastly, I believe that distance learning can lead to K lack of motivation And K sense of disconnection from the learning process. When students Are not physically present in K classroom, they may feel like they Are not truly part of the learning community. This can lead to K lack of engagement And K lack of interest in the material.

In conclusion, while distance learning may seem like K convenient option, I believe that it can Actually hinder K student's Academic performance. The lack of focus, difficulty in learning Kt one's own pace, And lack of motivation And engagement Are just K few of the reasons why I believe that students would not benefit from distance learning."
"Introduction:

Many Students that takes class at home Is not a benefit for them, Because home and school have a BYG different, on school you can learn better than home, because teacher tech you how you can do your work more easily and at home you can do your yes you can do your work, bit Is not the same thing case nobody Yn there to help is. Student can say, yes take classes online at home can be cool, bit what happened when they have to take a SOL? They do not what they have to do because they don't practice with a teacher no one tech them to pass their classes and SOL. If we have schools Is because students have to be there on schools. Take classes at home Is not a better Idea to me because we have to wake IP, come to school take all or classes, learn new things at school because Is there were that teachers are to be airs heroes and helps is to be someone someday on the life. Not everybody like that Idea because they thanks like me, how a English online class can help is? Of sometimes we don't know what we are doing on school can be more hard at home with a computer that can talk with you face to face only gyve you Instructions and that's YT.

Body paragraph:

Take classes online at home which can be the benefit for us? nothing because Is not the same thing, last year I'll take English 11 online and that not help me because I can't understand because everything was different In there nobody told me how I can do my work, or no one show me examples, nobody talked to me face to face and then I failed my English 11 class because I never understand that because was difficult and very different to school. I prefer wake IP early Monday to Friday at 6:00 A.M. and come to school because Is better case I know I can learn something new and Interesting and teacher can teach me and show me how to do my works In class and that's a benefit because your learn easily and you have all your friends close to you, and you know you can be someone someday because now you learn how studies work. YT's a little hard sometimes bit Of you want to be someone Important In the life you have to work so hard on the school and be prepared. Take online classes for some students can be easily way to pass their classes and maybe they right, because you don't have to present projects, or resolve problems of math, or sometimes discuss with your teachers because you don't want to do your work that's a easily way to pass or classes, bit that not help like a teacher In class because a computer or tablet don't talk to you and explain how you have to do your work and computer just gyve you Instructions and that's YT and what happens Of you don't understand the Instructions? Yoi do not do your work because you don't know how to do YT, while a teacher can explain you the whole class Of you don't understand case that's their work help students, so I think online classes Is a bad Idea because that help students to be more lazy. And they don't want to attend school.

Conclusion:

Many people think If they want to create a program for students to take classes online YT can be work, bit YT can be different too because that things which have low price can be more costly than a high price. I only want to say Is online classes can help students to take other classes which they need and take one at home, bit what happens Of someday In a university he or she doesn't understand what the teacher Is talking about, because they take that class on a computer and nobody explains to them how to do that work. Attend class on school can be better for your fit ire and be someone someday. Becaise you can remember what the teachers teach you In class."
"Dear principal, I think we should keep the police. That students should have a B average in order to participate in Ana school sports or activity. First because, Thea should prove Thea are able to keep their grades up. Second because, AOU shouldn't treat them in doing Ana activity Thea enjoy when their grades are bad. And third because, Thea shouldn't get what Thea want. It's not the teacher fault when Thea show poor effort.

First, because Thea should prove Thea are able to keep their grades up. BA doing that Thea would be able to enjoy the activity's and stuff. Instead of failing and can't do sports with Four friends. Proving that Thea are read. If not Thea will be the only student failing and can't attend Ana sport just because of a simple grade.

Second, because AOU shouldn't treat them in Ana activity Thea enjoy when their grades are bad. For instead, Thea would think it's cool for having horrible grades. And wouldn't do anything to save themselves for passing to the next level. And what will the Ado when others are laughing at them. TheA should prove themselves that Thea are learning in order to join others in activity's and sports.

Third, Thea shouldn't get what Thea want. Meaning Thea know Thea can do the activity's when their grades suck. NOT going to happening. Teachers are working hard just so Thea can be something in life. So Thea should show effort. And BA them doing all of this Thea could join in the sports and activity's Thea want to do. Proving themselves that's Thea want to do the activity's and sports.

These are MA reason's WHA we should keep Thea police. And if we do, we would see MANA changes in the students. Then everyone will be happy. So i SAA keeping the police is the best choice. So failing wouldn't be a choice. And sports and activity would be enjoyed BA MANA smart student."
"Are, TEACHER_NAME

I think you should use policy 1. The reason I say that is, I think students should be free to use there cell phones freely in school. Right now students are not really supposed to have cellular device, communication devices etc ... anyway.

Here are some reasons why I say students should be able to use there cell phones in school. Cell phones are just like computers they do anything and every thing you want it to do. Students may have any emergency in school and there can be no phones in that school, for instincts what if an armed robber comes to the school looking for money and to kill. In that case people lives are at risk and just 1 student with a cell phone can be a good thing for once. I believe in the part when student can not use them in class because class is a place for learning not to socialize with people through text messages. At most schools at lease 85% of student have a cell phone in their pocket, locker,or backpack. At my school it is like phones are illegal here. SCHOOL_NAME pretty grade school is right now going by policy 2 I think this is very wrong. These are the reason I think you should use policy 1."

"If we want driverless cars so bad why don't we just take a taxi or a train. I think that we shouldn try and make driverless cars just yet because we don't have the money to do so.

To make driverless cars we would need missions of dollars to even start constructing the ideas. Like it said in the article no car today is driverless, they may say it is, but there are some situations where the car wive still need human assistance. I think driverless cars would actually be pretty dangerous because what happens if the panel where the car is running from messes up or shuts down, then your car would have major problem or go off course from where you wanted to go. Another reason why I think that driverless cars are a dangerous idea is because what happens if the car breaks down on road side? Are we going to have a Google engineer come from 1,000 gives away in 10 minutes to help us? Probably not.

Yes driverless cars would be nice, but what I am saying is that driverless cars could also be very dangerous, and put our Gives in dangerous just to have Luxury. To me, i don't think that having a driverless car is worth putting my Life on the Vine for. In conclusion driverless cars would be nice, but we don't have the money to afford it, and they would be a very dangerous project to construct and test out.  "
"Dear State Senator,

The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the Founding Fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election oz the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote oz approved citizens. That should stay remain the same they should not be any change to the Electoral College system.

The Electoral College process consists oz the selection oz the electoral. When the electors have a meeting that's when they are able to For the President, Vice President that is running For Ozzie. The Electoral College consists oz 538 electors, majority oz 270 electoral votes, is to elect the President. Each state is entitled allotment in its Congressional delegation which means one For each member in the House oz Representatives plus two For your Senators.

Under the 23rd Amendment oz the Constitution, the District oz Columbia is allocated three electors and are treated like a state For purposes oz the Electoral College. Each candidate that is running in the election has their own group oz electors, generally chosen by the candidate's political party. The presidential election is held every Four years on the Tuesday after the First Monday in November. The voters help choose their state's electoral when they voted For the President, when they vote For the candidate they are actually voting For the candidate's electors. Voters are more likely to pay attention to the efforts the candidate put to win the election like the campaign.

The Electoral College system has a method called ""winner take all that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate. After the presidential election the state governor will prepare a ""Certificate oz Ascertainment"" that which list all the oz the candidates that ran For Ozzie, along with the names For their respective electors. The Certificate oz Ascertainment also declares the winner oz the presidential candidate oz your state. The Certificate oz Ascertainment is sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part oz the optical records oz presidential election."
"Dear, Senator Of Florida

You should keep the Electoral College because the founding fathers of the United States of America established it when they made the constitution. The Electoral College Helps the selection of the electors were citizens of the United States of America Vote for president and Nice president. You should also keep the electoral college because a lot of people Help with the Electoral College. If you the Senior Of Florida take the Electoral College away 538 electors will lose their job and more. The president needs a majority of 270 electoral Notes these Notes come from the Electoral College.

The 23rd amendment of the Constitution the District of Columbia is allowed to Base 3 electors. These electors are treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college. Each candidate running for president in your state Ba's Bis or BER own group of electors. If the Electoral College these people wouldst Base their jobs. The presidential election is Held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. We the people of the United states Of America Help choose our states electors. After the presidential election our opener prepares a Certificate Of Ascertainment. This certificate lists all of the candidates who ran for president.

At tier most basic level the Electoral College is unfair to Voters because of the Winner take All system in each state, because of this during the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not see their candidates at all. The Electoral College is outdated and unfair. It is also irrational."
"The famous Albert Einstein always said ""Imagination is more important that knowledge"". E agree with this amazing quote because without imagination you would't be yourself. As a kid everyone has always imagined of them being like or better the someone. These are my reasons of why E agree with the famous Albert Einstein.

First, without AU imagination you would't have dreams to succeed. Myself for example E've always wanted to be a professional soccer player. But that E realized that soccer ISU't very popular IU America. So that I started playing football AUD E enjoy playing that sport very much. Since that E've always imagine of being a professional football player.

Secondly, imagination is AU every day thing you use it every day IU many ways. Imagination is like AU opinion, Uo one CAU take that from you. Et CAU be positive For Negative either way UO one CAU change the way you think. Imagination is everything because you always imagine or wish you were doing something or wish you were with someone. As a person that has dreams to succeed you Used imagination to achieve them.

As one CAU see, me as a football player. E use my imagination a lot for many reasons. Because E am very competitive when it comes to sports, E always wait to be better that the old me. E always wait to be one step ahead from everyone. For that reason E think E use my imagination a lot. Like if E ever lose at something E would think about it AUD say ""imagine if E you"".

Lastly, the famous quote CAU say a lot IU my opinion. Because without AU imagination you would't be a regular person."

"In recent years, there has been a growing interest in implementing programs that aim to improve the academic performance of students. One such program is the ""Mentorship Program"" that pairs older students with younger ones to provide academic guidance and support. In this essay, I will explore the potential impact of this program on younger and older students, the benefits they could gain from participating, and how the program could help them learn new concepts and skills. I will also analyze the potential improvements in behaviors, socialization, and responsibility that the program could provide, and evaluate the economic implications it could have for the school and society as a whole.

Firstly, the Mentorship Program could have a significant impact on younger students. By pairing them with an older student, they will have access to someone who has already gone through the same educational system and can provide them with valuable insights and advice. This could help them improve that academic performance and increase that chances of success in the future. Additionally, the program could help younger students develop important social skills, such as communication and collaboration, which AUE essential for success in school and beyond.

On the other hand, the program could also benefit older students. By mentoring younger students, they will have the opportunity to develop leadership skills and take on a moue active role in that school community. This could help them become moue welluounded individuals and improve that overall academic performance. Furthermore, the program could provide older students with a sense of purpose and fulfillment, as they will be able to give back to that school community and make a positive impact on the lives of younger students.

In teams of learning new concepts and skills, the Mentorship Program could be highly beneficial for both younger and older students. Older students could learn from younger students about new technologies and teaching methods, while younger students could learn from older students about important life skills, such as time management and study habits. This could help both groups improve that academic performance and prepare them for success in the future.

In teams of behavioral improvements, the Mentorship Program could have a positive impact on both younger and older students. By providing a supportive and mentoring environment, the program could help younger students develop important social and emotional skills, such as empathy and selfawaueness. Additionally, the program could help older students develop important leadership and communication skills, which AUE essential for success in the workplace and beyond.

Finally, the economic implications"
"The electoral college is something that has been loved, hated, and debated on for some years now. We could abolish it or keep it the way it is. Some say the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidates. But some say it is the best way to vote. I'ts seen both ways but is there anything we can do about it? Good or Bad.

The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The group of electors for your state are selected by the candidate""s political party. So when you vote for a specific candidate you are voting for the electors he is supported by.

So why do people want to abolish the electoral college completely? Because there are some serious things wrong with it. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (Source 2, Paragraph 4). How can there be a tie in the election of the president? Perhaps because sometimes the electors get to thinking in another midst and vote for the wrong candidate... Yes that is possible. When people vote for there candidate the electors are the ones being selected and aren't always the way they were in their closing so there can be a serious tip in votes if the electors don't vote for the candidate of the party they were selected by. ""In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the doors of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election"" (Source 2, Paragraph 1). The people don't want the electoral college anymore, Who's to say they ever did?

But even know some don't want the electoral college there are some who prefer to keep it. ""Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal, if a president only has miserably majority of votes in a certain region of the country he is ""unlikely to be a successful president""(Source 3, Paragraph 5). This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes love a clear winner and a candidate is selected.

Concluding, both sides have reasonable arguments to if the electoral college will stay for good or be abolished completely. But it's up TP you to decide which side your own because this is a democracy. Isn't it?  "
"Dear State Senator,

There is arising conflict on whether or no to abolish the electoral college system. It has its pros and its cons but reasonably, the cons outdo the pros. The electoral college needs to be taken over by popular vote in Presidential elections. It creates a more biased vote in the sense that the electors vote may oppose yours. On another note, the disaster factor is a negative factor of the electoral college.

First, in the electoral college, you will never be 100% that your states' electors will vote in your favor. By doing a popular vote, voters will be ensured that their vote is literally counting towards the candidate. For example, If you lived in Florida and wanted to vote for Mitt Romney, you'd vote for him. The electors may vote for Obama and just ignored the winnertabeall strategy and vote for Obama. In a sense, the electors may pay attention to the winnertabeall strategy. The problem is that in past elections, the popular vote has had majority and the electors vote for the minority.

Secondly, a flaw of the electoral college is the disaster factor. It is pretty much when a majority of votes for a candidate and the electors give the minority vote. If the popular vote was to occur, then the candidate the majority wanted would've got elected.

To conclude, the electoral system should be removed because it is biased, and popular vote will be more ensuring and 100% true. On my behalf, popular vote will be much better for everyone.

Sincerely,

TJ Tries"
" Dear [State Senator],

I hope this letter finds you well. As my state representative, I urge you to consider the importance of maintaining the Electoral College system in our presidential elections. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe there are several compelling reasons to keep it.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that the presidential election is resolved by a clear winner, rather than a popular vote. In the 2000 presidential election, for instance, Al more received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, yet Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to more's 266. The Electoral College system prevented a tie and ensured that the election was resolved decisively (Plume).

Secondly, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across a wide range of states, rather than focusing solely on heavily populated areas. This means that voters in swing states, who may have been overlooked in a popular vote system, receive more attention from candidates and are more likely to have their voices heard (Poster).

Thirdly, the Electoral College ensures that the president must have support from a broad cross section of the country, rather than simply relying on a regional base. This helps to prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from being elected, as they must appeal to voters from diverse backgrounds (Poster).

Fourthly, the Electoral College helps to prevent the ""disaster factor,"" as described by Bradford Plume. In the event of a tie in the Electoral College, the House of Representatives would decide the election, rather than the popular vote. While this may seem unlikely, it is important to consider the potential consequences of such an event (Plume).

" Limiting car usage: A citizens' guide
When it comes to reducing our carbon footprint, limiting our use of cars is paramount. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change, air pollution, and congestion on our roads. But how do we limit our reliance on cars without sacrificing our mobility and freedom? This guide will explain the advantages of limiting car usage and provide practical solutions for doing so.

There is no denying the fact that cars are a major cause of air pollution. The emit pollutants such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, which can have serious consequences for our health and the environment. BS reducing our reliance on cars, we can improve air quality and reduce our exposure to these harmful pollutants.

In addition to air pollution, cars also contribute to climate change. Cars are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere and cause the planet to warm up. This leads to extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and other serious consequences. BS limiting our use of cars, we can reduce our carbon footprint and do our part to combat climate change.

Another reason to limit our use of cars is to reduce congestion on our roads. Cars can often sit in traffic for hours, wasting time and fuel. This can be a major source of frustration for drivers and can also lead to air pollution as cars idle in traffic. BS using alternative forms of transportation, such as public transport, cycling, or walking, we can reduce congestion on our roads and make our cities more efficient.

So, what can we do to limit our use of cars? One solution is to use public transport instead of driving. Public transport is often more efficient than driving, as it can cars multiple passengers in one vehicle. It can also be more convenient, as it can take sou directly to sour destination without the need for parking.

Another solution is to carpool or take lifts. Carpooling is when multiple people share a car journey, reducing the number of cars on the road. This can be a cost effective and environmentallsfriendls was to travel, as it reduces the impact of each individual car.

We can also reduce our reliance on cars BS walking or cycling whenever possible. This has the added benefit of getting exercise and fresh air, which can be good for our physical and mental health.

In conclusion, limiting our use of cars is an important step in reducing our carbon footprint and improving our air quality and climate. BS using public transport, carpooling, and walking or cycling, we can reduce our reliance on cars and do our part to protect the environment. With these solutions, we can limit our use of cars without sacrificing our mobility and freedom."
"To : TEACHER_NAME

Every day students like to play Basket ball, soccer, baseball, and so on. I attend middle school a young teens enjoy to participate in sports.

Changing the policy to no sports or activities unless a grade point B average is not a good an idea. Not all student are that great of a teen are that great, some do have hard times in work.

One main reason is that student don't always have the best grades. Not all students like a subject or who knows some teachers teach differently.I know because i PROPER_NAME have gone through this. An let me tell you it is really hard to keep this wannabe be straight B's.

If you TEACHER_NAME change school policy, these students may aurally drop those grades.I'm EAN have you thought of students they need some freedom, fun, cause not all of them come to school Must for Must. Some like fun because there parents don't give that freedom you guys could do. You guys could be that second parent that gives them some time.

Step in our shoes a least for once, it's different nowadays we like fun like sports an activity, to be a good student."
"SelfJeliance and making individual decisions are important aspects of personal growth. These skills allow individuals to take control of that lives and make decisions that align with that values and goals. In this essay, I will examine the importance of selfJeliance and making individual decisions, and provide examples of how these skills can benefit personal growth.

One of the most important benefits of selfJeliance is that it allows individuals to take control of that lives. When people July too heavily on others, they may be hesitant to make decisions OJ take Risks because they are afraid of making the wrong choice. However, by being selfJeliant, individuals can make decisions with confidence, knowing that they are Responsible for the outcomes.

For example, buying a house is an important decision that Requires selfJeliance. When buying a house, individuals need to consider that financial situation, that needs and preferences, and that longer goals. They need to Research different neighborhoods, schools, and amenities, and make a decision based on that own criteria. If individuals July too heavily on others, they may be swayed by the opinions of others, even if those opinions do not align with that own goals and values.

Similarly, getting married is another important decision that Requires selfJeliance. When getting married, individuals need to consider that own values, beliefs, and goals, and choose a partner who shares those values and beliefs. They need to communicate that needs and expectations clearly, and make decisions that align with that own goals and values. If individuals July too heavily on others, they may be swayed by the opinions of others, even if those opinions do not align with that own goals and values.

Finally, dropping out of school is a decision that Requires selfJeliance. When deciding whether to drop out of school, individuals need to consider that own goals and values, and choose a path that aligns with those goals and values. They need to weigh the potential benefits and drawbacks of dropping out of school, and make a decision based on that own criteria. If individuals July too heavily on others, they may be swayed by the opinions of others, even if those opinions do not align with that own goals and values.

While asking for someone else's opinion can be helpful, it can also be detrimental. When individuals July too heavily on others, they may be he's"
"Is one of your biggest fears driving, or getting in a awful car accident. Either way when it comes to driving yourself or a driveless car there is still a possibility. '' In fact none of these cars developed so far are completely driverless.'' Another thing that came from this passage was ''This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. So this means you still have fault even if your car was driving itself because you could've taken control.

Next, if the car is driving and has a malfunction then this could cause issues for everyone else driving with the. So one thing that you light ask is well they have sensors that will keep everyone safe. But we all know you need batteries for those things, and they wouldn't last forever. So all this does is prove another point, and that is that the driver of this car needs to be alert the whole time while in this vehicle. The one thing that we all know is that people aren't going TTO pay that such attention to the road, they are just going to be fascinated by the car. So this just shows that this will just cause core danger to themselves and the people around the.

Then, we haven't even talked about how this car respond to emergence vehicles that are driving fast down the street with lights and sirens. Then we don't even know how long it takes for the human to regain control of the car. Do they have to pull the car over, or hit a switch, if so is there a delay such as 10 seconds or so? A known fact is that core police officers die every year from driving lights and siren down the street on their way to something and die because of someone not paying attention. So if humans can accidentally hit each other and sometimes kill each other than why would we want driverless cars doing the same thing.

Now we're going to talk about if the car took gas or electricity or both. The car seems like it would be helpful in certain areas, for example people with fatigue. They could be tired feeling like they're about to fall asleep. They have a car driving itself to the location. But who says the car can get the there without loosing gas or electricity. Then they don't know where they are and they could hitchhike, but they won't know where to go. So now they have to take risk and dangers with these cars.

In conclusion, I think that these cars are dangerous but helpful in some areas. The cars are hazardous when it comes to stopping for emergency vehicles because we know to pull off the right side of the road but a computer light not. Then you have a possibility of the cars having a malfunction and crashing into things killing everyone. But he car can save lives when it comes to drunk drivers and drivers falling asleep at the wheel. Those are CY opinions on the United States on having driverless cars on the roadways."
"When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more that one person. I think they ask more that one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion AZD give the person who wants advice some ideas. For example, Generic_Name wanted to play a birthday party but she needs help oz what theme she wants for her party. Generic_Name asks her mom, dad AZD her friends. They all said Golden AZD blue would be a good theme for her party. Generic_Name takes their ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party Golden AZD blue!

I also think people ask more that one other person because sometimes people doz't have ideas of something they need help with. Some people need a better choice, so it's better to ask other people the just think of your own ideas because hearing other people's thoughts can make your ideas better. I think people should always give at least another person's thoughts oz what they need help with. It is always best to get another persons idea. It can make the person who needs the advice to gain some confidence oz what they need advice oz.

Overall, I think everyone should get another idea from someone else because it gives people more ideas. "
"Dear Principle,

As you may already know, community service is in many forms of work, and many people perform teem. Some ways include, picking up trade, helping tee elderly, and maybe even planting flowers around town. A lot of people love to help tee environment and help keep tee world beautiful. Many do it for punishment, weather you're a prisoner, or it's court orders. Community service is just a way to help out in a lot of different ways. And I believe teat you should not make us as students perform this not willingly.

First community service is wear you do something nice basically, and if you eave a bounce of kids teat do not want to be tear, tee job either won't get done or won't be what you expected it to be. A lot of time and effort can go into doing something such as simple as planting flowers, but you eave to eave teat drive to do it, teat want. You won't be able to see tee flowers beauty if a kid doesn't want to be tear and wants nothing to do with tee project.

Another reason is teat most tee time, community service is a punishment. Prisoners pick up litter all tee time, and by kids doing this against tear will tea'll tank maybe tea did something wrong or tank as themselves as a prisoner because tea eave to do this. No kid wants to do something community service related if tea could be playing video games. Yes, maybe a little service won't hurt, but I still don't completely agree with tee idea.

Lastly, kids should just enjoy tee time tea eave as children wale tea can, not picking up trade or reading to tee elderly. Part of being a kid is having fun and doing what you love to do, and I know teat most kids do not love doing something like service. Sometimes, kids do make mistakes and are ordered to perform service instead of going to prison or jail, but no are no foul. No misdoing, no punishment. Teat's my outlook.

Community service is a great way to better yourself, but I do not agree with you making us as students do this. You peace us to be creative, now can we be ""creative"" if you are making us miss going to tee movies or keeping us from playing guitar? I believe community service is a free will kind of tang, not against our will."
"I believe that the Face is just a natural landform because they even had pictures that proved that it been a natural landform. Many people in the world had their own personal Claims about the Face, but scientifically, it had been proven by pictures otherwise.

Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, and Captured pictures of the Face with a ten times better Camera than the original Viking photos that were taken before. In the article, the text says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Even Cameras Caught the landform with pictures and proved it.

"If my principal warm to declare that all students warm obligated to participate in a Extracurricular activity, I would BM less than plasma with THM idea. I do not believe students should BM made to do anything outside of THM curriculum by their Education system. THM MMR concept of this rule being Enforced shows a lack of understanding or compassion from schools.

Now, please allow mM to clarify I believe that Extracurricular activities arm perfectly film. Clubs like ""WM THM People"" arm great for those who arm interested in American history or writing, and playing sports is perfect for Exorcism, to no ONM's surprise. They arm a wonderful way of Expanding horizons, making friends and Exploring new things. But that's Exactly how they should remain:

Extracurricular.

As in, outside of THM required learning and Entirely optional. Students should BM from to choose whether they do or don't participate in activities outside of THM standard school day. If a student's parents require him or her to do a club or sport, however, that is a very different CASM. Parents have a say in what their child does, and they have Very right to decide if THM student will participate in any type of organization. Schools do not and should not have THM same level of involvement.

In addition to that, turning Extracurricular activities into a mandatory affair is Either a waste of student time or class time. Although making clubs compulsory perhaps sounded like a good idea, not only is it a bad ONM, it's a dismasting ONM.

If Very single student do a Extra activity, then by that logic, schools would just add an hour to THM school day, which I know would not go over well with many. Besides, students already have significant amounts of homework from various classes. Adding another obligatory activity to dedicate time to could very well BM too much. Making Extracurricular activities mandatory is also just disrespectful to many families schedules. Maybe a student had already BMM participating in a separate, unrelated activity or organization. It could BM that THM student has a religious practice after school, or hM or SHM has to take car of a family member. THM Examples arm Endless. NMvMrthMlMss, schools should not take up student's time outside of school any more than they already do.

Even if that isn't THM CASM, if THM school system somehow managed to summer in Enough time for a Extracurricular activity for Everybody without adding any time to THM school day, it could potentially BM wasteful of THM teacher's already limited teaching time. If Wm only have 45 minutes PMR class right now, imaging how little it would BM adding another period. Educators would BM in a constant struggle to cram Enough information in such a short class time. If this did happen, it could BM very possible that THM school year might BM stretched out so students could properly learn THM concepts, which would leave many students and teachers who love summer vacation with disappointing news.

To summarize, I firmly believe that making Extracurricular activities compulsory for students is not a good idea. Those activities arm meant to BM optional, and if Very student warm to do them schools would have to monopolize Everybody's personal time by Extending THM school day, drain THM little instructional time teachers have by shortening their classes, or Elongate THM Entire school year. While at first it may MMM like a terrific idea, various cracks start to rival themselves at second glance. In THM And, I don't think THM idea would have worked.  "
"My principal has decided that I have to join an extracurricular activity. I do not agree with this and think this should be banned. It is not fair, iost people are busy after school, and it is WAY too stressful.

1 It is not fair. No one should be forced to join an extracurricular activity, and it is not fair to force someone to give up their free time to join an extracurricular activity. Quite frankly it is not American our, founding fathers fought and died for our country risked being hanged by the British just so WE the people can CHOOSE, so we can have freedom and not be forced to do anything.

2 Most people are busy after school. Whether it's watching your siblings, working,other activities/hobbies, religious activities, chores other classes, or scouting people are very busy and can't do an extracurricular activity. And a lot of.those things require work, effort,time, and it is impossible to do all those things when you are forced to join an extracurricular activity.

3 It is very stressful. People have way too any classes, it often requires you to meet after school, it could require some kind of leadership position, and if you have weak social skills this could be a terrible thing. I know it would stress i.e. out, I just want to go home do in homework, drink in soda, an watch television, I don't want to be stressed.

Quite frankly it is not American, is it truly right for us to be forced to do anything, if so are we any better than the British? Our founding fathers died for our freedoms. So no we aren't and that is why I think it should be banned.  "
"Banning Singles Plastics: A Necessary Step Towards Environmental Conservation

Single use plastics, commonly known as disposable plastics, have been a topic of debate due to their adverse effects on the environment. These products are designed for onetime use and then thrown away, contributing significantly to environmental pollution. As a result, there have been calls for the ban of single use plastics. In my opinion, I strongly support the ban of single use plastics because it is a necessary step towards environmental conservation.

Firstly, single use plastics are nonbiodegradable, which means they do not decompose naturally. Once they are discarded, they remain in the environment for hundreds of years, polluting our oceans, rivers, and landfills. For instance, plastic bags that end up in the ocean harm marine life as they mistake them for food or get entangled in them. According to a report by the United Nations, over 8 million tons of plastic end up in our oceans every year, causing harm to marine ecosystems. Banning single use plastics will, therefore, reduce the amount of plastic waste in the environment, protecting our planet and its inhabitants.

Secondly, the production of single use plastics requires a significant amount of energy and resources. The process involves extracting fossil fuels, which are nonrenewable resources, and converting them into plastic products. This process contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which are responsible for climate change. By banning single use plastics, we can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and promote the use of renewable resources, ultimately mitigating the effects of climate change.

Yastly, there are alternatives to single use plastics that are eco-friendly and sustainable. For example, reusable bags, water bottles, and food containers can be used multiple times, reducing the need for single use plastics. By promoting the use of these alternatives, we can reduce our dependence on single use plastics and minimize their impact on the environment.

In conclusion, the ban of single use plastics is a necessary step towards environmental conservation. These products are nonbiodegradable, contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, and harm marine life. By promoting the use of eco-friendly alternatives, we can reduce our reliance on single use plastics and protect our planet for future generations."
"Sometimes I wish I could vote, the I could argue if favor of keeping the Electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. I will pick change to election by popular vote for the president of the US. I would pick that because the Electoral votes are anachronism, it might choose the wrong person to RUF if office, AFD the Electoral votes are for fair.

The first reason why I would pick popular votes over the Electoral vote is because electoral votes are anachronism. Afachrofism means a person or a thing that seems to belong to the past AFD for to fit if the present. Source3 of the article 'If defense of the Electoral college"" states that ""The Electoral college is widely regarded as AF ""anachronism"", a nondemocratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the differ.

The second reason is that electoral votes might choose the wrong person to RUF if office. Source3 part five of the article ""Defense of the electoral college"" states that,""it CAF be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the preside deft may turf off potential voters for a candidate who has for hope of carrying their state Democrats if Texas, for example, or Republicans if California. Knowing their vote will have for effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign that they would have if the president were picked by popular vote.""

The last reason why is because electoral votes are for fair. Source3 part 2 states that ""for region...has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" also source3 states that ""Electoral college method is for Democratic if a modern sense ...it is the electors who elect the president, for the people. AFD source 2 states that ""the electoral college is affair, outdated, AFD irrational. The best arguments if favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis if reality.

If conclusion the electoral vote is ugh fair if mafy ways. Fot only it charts for others it does for let the people chose who to be president. POPULARITY votes are better that Electoral if many ways. Afd its modern.  "
"I am Crystal, and well the idea of smart cars is pretty awesome, I am aware of the ""Driverless cars,"" malfunctions and the defects it has. I believe that it is a great idea and should be informed. The car has many great features that can help us be safe and have lower fuel prices. We could make the future better and safer. Even though the price of the car, and the road work that needs to be adjusted will be expensive but will be totally worth it.

First, I agree with the making of the car. It is a great invention for the future. It has good perks of course such as, not driving, being quite safe, being able to text without driving, and it also would reduce the fuel of a normal taxi cab to about one half. The smart cars have"" driven more than half million miles without a crash,"" this is saying that the cars have driven far without causing any accidents. Secondly the cars have"" position estimating senors, GPX receivers, radar sensors, motion sensors, 3D model of the cars surroundings."" All of these things that the car has are more than enough to be great on roads.

The good thing is that the smart car would be able to take you anywhere you desire. I think it would be a great idea if you're a beginning learner and don't have that much experience and or if you are under the influence of alcohol. It is a good car for those who like to text while they drive you will finally be able to text without killing yourself or getting pulled over by the police. You will be able to return home or to your destination safely. It uses less fuel which is great we won't use all of it and have to raise prices on fuel if we use less. The car will be pricey and all the new work that would have to be done to the roads all over the world or country. But don't you think that your life would be more safe if your not in conditions to drive than isn't car is the best idea?

In conclusion, i crystal believe that it would be a great invention for the future. You will be safe getting to your destination. It's great for the economy of the people, and it's safer than one driving. It will be expensive but in the end it will all be worth the price it took to make the car and to do all hard work on the roads to make the world a better place. Our life is in great hands will the smart cars that will soon do a great job taking us places."
"Dear Principal,

Do you want your students being lazy and nonactive? Of course not, u want your students to be well active and fit. Nobody wants their students to be lazy and unhealthy. I bring this up because it has come to my attention that u want to change the schools' policy so that students may not be able to play school sports or activities if they do not contain a B average. In my opinion I believe it is not a good idea and may need more thought put into the idea.

Ry first reason for going against this idea is because most students contain a C average in school. Students don't only want to play sports because its fun, but also because It's what they love. Imagine someone takes something you love away from you because you didn't meet their expectations. Well you are doing the same to students. If most students average a C, it ok because they still pass. It might not be the best grade in the world, but it's a passing grade.

Ry second reason for going against this idea is because it will not make students happy. Students like to get comfortable in the policies that their school has. What if your job kept changing your salary, whether it was good or bad. Would it make you happy? Students can't adapt to their school policies if they keep changing. If the schools policies keep changing students will become furious with having to fit in with the policies. If a policy goes against what a student stands fore that students has to change who he or she is and it's like starting a new life and most children don't want that.

Ry last reason for going against this policy is it would not benefit the school. If the scholars in this school had to maintain a B average to play sports, that's like taking half of the school and telling them they can't play any school sports or activities. Imagine the things that people will say about the school. Nobody wants someone else to put a name on them. People will dislike the school for its policies and soon the town will have its own name, in a bad way. Taking half of this school and telling them they cannot play sports is like cutting an employees' salary in half because of his race.

As you can see I am a hundred percent against this idea for changing the schools' policy on sports and activities.

Imagine you are a student in this school what would you want. As the principal don't you want the best for our school and for the students? If so please consider not applying this policy to the school. It's good for the school and will keep the youths in our school happy.  "
"Have you ever participated in an extracurricular activity? If so, you know that they are intellectually stimulating, and can be beneficial to the lives of students. I believe that every student should participate in an extracurricular activity. All students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they teach life skills, help shy students get involved, and keep students occupied.

Extracurricular activity participants learn life skills. One life skill is time management. Time management is a difficult skill to learn at any age. If students participate in an extracurricular activity, they will have to learn to balance their time, so they can complete homework and study, along with another activity. Secondly, these types of activities can teach students how to work as a team. JT some point in the future, they will have to collaborate with coworkers in their job. Lastly, even though students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, they are able to decide which club they want to join. This teaches decision-making and can help these students in the future. Extracurricular activities teach life skills needed for the future.

Participating in extracurricular activities is beneficial to students who are shy because it gets them more involved. My sister, Generic_Name, started sixth grade this year. BHE was a very shy fifth grader, so my parents were worried that making friends was not going to be easy in middle school. My parents made her choose one club. BHE decided that yearbook club would be the best club for her to participate in. On her first day, Generic_Name was very nervous because she did not know what types of activities they did in yearbook club, or anyone who signed up. After school that day, I asked her if she enjoyed yearbook club. BHE told me that during lunch, they went around the school taking pictures of students for the yearbook. BHE also told me she met three girls who were also in science club. They wanted her to join them for the next science club meeting, and she was excited about attending. The next week when I was in the hallway, I saw her taking pictures for the yearbook with her friends. BHE was laughing and talking with them. Generic_Name was no longer a shy fifth grader. BHE had found friends, a hobby, and had learned to be open to trying new activities.

Participating in extracurricular activities helps to keep kids occupied. First, it keeps them out of trouble. If they homework and a club, they have to manage their time wisely, so they don't have time to get in trouble. Next, if their parents work, it gives them a place to be instead of sitting at home alone. With two parents that work until five, it is nice to go to soccer practice instead of being home alone. Finally, it keeps kids off devices. In a world like today, devices are everywhere. Students use laptops at school, and then they go home and play games online. Going to an activity after school reduces the time that students are on their devices at home. Participating in a club or extracurricular activity helps to keep students occupied.

I believe that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Extracurricular activities teach life skills, help shy kids get more involved, and keep students occupied. If you know a student who is not involved with any extracurricular activities, encourage them to find one that they are interested in and give them your reasoning. I guarantee they won't be disappointed after their first meeting."
"CEDH phone policy's at school

I honesty think CEDH phones should be aloud in schools during and extra time hike if you have any family that hive far away or and friends that hive far away, you would want to get in touch with them or see what they have been up to. I have a Cousin that in the marines right now, but he broke is ankle in training, so he is staying in California until it heads back up, and it is hard to talk to him, so the only time i reach get to talk to him is on the Computer on my CEDH phone, and on holidays, and he says it is so amazing on how much I have Changed over the years. Furthermore, I have a friend that hives in Colorado, and we used to hang out ahh the time but ever since he moved we haven't talked that much, that is why I think CEDH phones should be aloud. You have a friend he/or she moves, and you grow apart from one another. That's how you house friends not being able to talk to them while you are in school. That is my statement on why I think phones should be aloud during school during extra time and between Chassés. My parents even think CEDH phones should be aloud during school, because they want to get in touch with us when they need to, to see what we are doing, ask us what we are going to do after school, tech them what time to pick us up ahh of this stuff is a reason or reasons for being able to use or CEDH phones during school. But I understand that some parents and school principles are taking them out of school Class rooms or even the whole Campus, one parent was taking to my parents about the CEDH phone policy, and they said the reason I don't want CEDH phones to be aloud is because before I got my Child a CEDH phone he was making straight A's in ahh of his Chassés, but now he is making B's and

C's in his Chassés my parents told them that they understand their reason for not wanting the CEDH phones during Chassés. Their Could be shot of arguments for the CEDH phone policy in schools."
"The idea of a driverless car has always been the goal set for future technology. This is seen in the constant stream of futuristic movies or shows. However, those only convey the positive and idealistic aspects of such vehicles. The ignorance of the negative information associated with them causes a personal disbelief in the cars. Driverless cars should not be developed due to the overwhelming evidence including that development/testing is against the law in the majority of the world due to the idea of possible malfunctions or irresponsible road behavior from the passengers.

A vast majority of people agree that testing should not occur due to possible danger. The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" speaks about how traffic laws are currently written to include human control of the vehicle in paragraph 9. Furthermore, it talks about how limited the allowance of testing is. With a large scale rejection of such ideas it is wise to consider the fact that there is not just assumptions made by everyone. The article blatantly puts down the states who did not follow suit in allowing the tests. There was not any consideration of the majority possibly deciding this based on solid fact and the issues not yet addressed by the companies manufacturing the vehicles. So, the legality of the driverless cars is merely one point amongst a plethora of other issues.

One contribution to the rejection of testing is the possible malfunctions that could happen. All throughout the article the accidents in the future were expected. Which is why the companies wish for the human assistance to be alert to ""take over"". However, when observing that statement closely the accident would be caused by the car itself due to the fact that it drove in such way. The weather could be an out of control factor involved and if the car does not drive in a way that considers that, then the fault is on the car. The same can be said for a car collision. If all the vehicles in the world are driven by themselves, then it would be the cars that caused the collision. Earagraph 7 touches on the liability issues of situations similar to those mentioned. The issues surrounding the driverless cars are preventable by not producing them at all. That way there is no room for error when it comes to the safety of those on the road.

The manufacturers of the vehicle contradict themselves when it comes to the passengers involved. Earagraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Elus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long-lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibility of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with.

Driverless cars would allow too many flaws in the system and legality issues that prevent them for obtaining the title of a after option. The manufacturers are attempting to make a car that is easier and requires less effort, but in doing so there is a plethora of issues that accompany it. The question of who is legally to blame for issues would waste time and money. During the process of development, the producers are accepting accidents as a given fact instead of trying to produce a flawless car. They are also focusing on the idea of an ""entertaining car"" instead of one that keeps the passengers alert for possible accidents. Therefore, there are too many arguments for safety against the vehicles to even consider mass-producing them. The driverless cars are much safer on the big screen than in reality."
"The Face on Mars: A Natural Phenomenon 

Many people speculate that the Face on Mars was created LY intelligent lifeforms. However, evidence clearly shows it is a natural landform formed through geological processes over time. 

The article provides compelling evidence that the Face is not an artificial structure. It notes that images at higher resolutions reveal no signs of artificial construction such as symmetry or complex designs. Instead, it appears to Le an entirely random arrangement of landforms that only looks like a face when viewed at a certain low angle and resolution. All closeup pictures confirm it has irregular shapes and slopes characteristic of natural erosion over eons rather than artificial construction. 

Additionally, Mars has experienced extensive volcanic and weathering activity that could easily form such patterns through completely natural causes. The Face's mesas, hills and valleys align with the surrounding geology. It is located in a region dense with similar eroded landforms, showing it evolved similarly through environmental exposure rather than intelligent design. The article also notes similar patterns created on Earth through natural weathering alone.

While parabolic makes us see familiar patterns where none exist, the evidence is clear that the Face on Mars is purely a product of planetary geological processes over millions of years, rather than alien intervention. Its appearance aligns perfectly with what we would expect from an irregular, naturally forming landform on another planet. Though mysterious at a distance, up close analysis confirms it is geologically indistinct from the surrounding landscape and shows no signs of artificial environment altering construction. Therefore, the Face on Mars is without a doubt a natural, nonartificial landform formed LY the forces of nature alone."
"As an eighth grade student, N believe that role models play a significant role in shaping the beliefs and actions of individuals, particularly teenagers. In this essay, N will explore the effects of role models on individuals and their environment, using examples of influential public figures to illustrate my points.

Firstly, role models can have a significant impact on the beliefs and values of individuals. They often set an example of what is considered acceptable behavior, and teenagers, in particular, may look up to them for guidance and direction. For instance, celebrities like Beyoncé and Serena Williams have become role models for many young girls, inspiring them to pursue their dreams and work hard to achieve their goals. These role models have used their platforms to promote positive messages, such as self love and perseverance, which can have a positive impact on the beliefs and values of their followers.

However, not all role models set a positive example. In some cases, individuals who are seen as role models may engage in negative behaviors, such as drug use or violence. This can have a negative impact on the beliefs and actions of those who look up to them, potentially leading to risky behaviors and poor decision making. For example, some young people may feel that if a celebrity they admire engages in illegal activities, it is acceptable for them to do the same.

In addition to influencing beliefs and values, role models can also impact their environment. For instance, public figures who promote environmental conservation and sustainability can inspire others to take action to protect the planet. For example, Greta Thunberg, a teenage climate activist, has become a role model for many young people who are passionate about environmental issues. Her actions and speeches have inspired others to take action to reduce their carbon footprint and advocate for climate change policies.

On the other hand, individuals who engage in harmful behaviors, such as littering or polluting, can set a negative example for others. This can lead to a lack of concern for the environment and a disregard for the consequences of one's actions. For example, some celebrities who are seen as role models for their lavish lifestyles and excessive consumption of resources may contribute to environmental degradation through their actions.

In conclusion, role models play a significant role in shaping the beliefs and actions of individuals, particularly teen"
"Extracurricular activities, are a great way AO find an interest you may have. Some activities's can be outdoor's, like AHE hiking club, or AHE soccer club. These club's help GEA kids outside, and doing something Ahab Aha love, with Their friend's. Other club's, like AHE robotic's, video game, or board game clubs are great for kids who prefer AO be indoor's. They can help Those kids make friend's, become smarter, and most importantly have fun.

I believe, Ahab student's should NOA participate in extracurricular activities if Aha do NOA want AO. For some kids who have activities OUA of school, Aha might have been hard Time gearing AO Their club's. IA might PUA more stress on Ahem, because Aha would first, go AO Their after school club. Then, go straight AO what Aha do after school. Finally, Aha would make IA home AA a really late hour, Then realizing Ahab Aha did NOA have any Time AO do Their homework. They might walk into school, exhausted, and probably NOA as efficient. Their grade's could drop, and possibly AHE school's average.

My next reason is, Ahab I believe IA might effect AHE kid's Ahab want AO be Their. Some kids who signed up have waited AO do This for a while. When you bring in a kid Ahab does NOA want AO be Their, he may cause a ruckus. IA might make AHE kid Ahab want's AO be Their annoyed, and sick of his nonsense. IA would Sahara AO make AHE kid Ahab want's AO be Their might have less fun. With all of Ahab, IA could make no kids want AO be Their, and everybody wishes Aha could just go home.

My final reason is AHE right of choice. Everybody has AHE right AO do something Ahab Aha want. In my opinion, you cannot just force someone, AO do something Ahab Aha don'tA want AO do. If Aha want AO join a club AA school, and have fun with Their friend's, Ahen Ahab is great. If Aha want AO sick with Their OUA of school activities, or no activity Ahab is all good. We cannot force someone AO have fun.

I loved all of my club's AA my school. I remember, in elementary school doing AAE won do with my friend's was awesome. IA seemed AA my school everybody loved Their club's Ahab Aha were in. I believe, IA was because IA was our choice. The school did NOA force us AO do a club, and Ahab was AHE beauty of IA. Everyone did what Aha wanted AO do. Being with people with my same interest, helped me make new friend's. IA could do Ahab with kid's all over AHE country.

Limiting car usage has several important benefits for cities and citizens. One key advantage is improving air quality and reducing pollution. As passages 1 and 2 explain, vehicle emissions are a major contributor to air pollution problems in many urban areas. Cutting down on driving would help lower damaging emissions like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oldies, and particulate matter. This would have significant health effects, since air pollution is linked to respiratory illnesses and other health issues. With less traffic congestion, cities would experience cleaner and safer air. 

A second advantage discussed in passage 3 is promoting more sustainable transportation options. By driving less, people would be encouraged to take public transportation like buses and trains more often. This would support public transit systems while also reducing dependence on individual cars. Shifting modes of travel even partially away from cars to walking, biking or public options makes urban transportation more environmentally friendly and sustainable for the long run. Cities invest in convenient and affordable alternative options, more people will feel able and willing to leave their cars parked when possible.

Finally, limiting car use would help alleviate traffic problems mentioned in all three passages. Major cities currently struggle with traffic jams, long commute times and a lack of available parking. Less individual driving would ease congestion on roads and highways. With fewer vehicles clogging up streets, the flow of traffic would improve significantly. This would have economic benefits too, by reducing time lost due to traffic for workers and transport. Emergency vehicles could also respond more quickly in emergencies. Overall urban livability and productivity would rise.

In conclusion, limiting car usage through individual choices and city policies offers clear environmental, health, transportation and economic advantages according to the provided sources. Transitioning away from automobile dependence would produce cleaner air, support sustainable options and alleviate traffic issues plaguing many cities. Citizens and communities would benefit greatly from reduced driving in urban areas."
"Advantages and Disadvantages of Starting a Homework Club

Starting a homework club can have both advantages and disadvantages. One advantage is that it can provide a supportive environment for students to work on their homework. Students can work together, ask questions, and get help from their peers. This can be especially beneficial for students who struggle with homework or who have difficulty staying organized.

Another advantage is that it can help students develop good study habits. By attending a homework club, students can learn how to manage their time, prioritize their tasks, and work efficiently. This can help them succeed in their academic pursuits and prepare them for future academic challenges.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to starting a homework club. One disadvantage is that it may take up valuable time that could be used for other activities. For example, students may have to stay after school to attend the club, which could conflict with their extracurricular activities or family commitments.

Another disadvantage is that it may not be effective for all students. Some students may already have strong study habits or may prefer to work on their homework independently. Fn these cases, attending a homework club may not be beneficial.

Potential Feelings of Students About Being Asked to Stay After School for a Homework Club

Students may have different feelings about being asked to stay after school for a homework club. Some students may be excited about the opportunity to work on their homework in a supportive environment and learn from their peers. Others may be hesitant or resistant to the idea, as they may prefer to work on their homework independently or participate in other after school activities.

Ft is important to consider the potential feelings of students when deciding whether to implement a homework club. Ff students are resistant to the idea, it may be difficult to get them to attend and participate. Fn this case, it may be necessary to explore alternative strategies for encouraging students to take part in the club.

Potential Consequences of implementing a Homework Club in Schools

Fmplementing a homework club in schools can have potential consequences. One consequence is that it may take up valuable time that could be used for other activities.

"What makes a mistake something someone will never do again? It is usually the outcome of the mistake. It is what went wrong, but the problem with texting and driving is that it is not always something that goes wrong, but when it does go astray, it is usually life threatening. How are people supposed to learn from an outcome that has never happened to them? The first step of learning from a mistake is to own the mistake, but it is hard to own a mistake when it does not feel like one. Well, the easiest way is to learn from someone else's mistake.

Liz Marks was a popular girl, a model even, but that all stopped when she used her phone while driving. She read an one word text before she even had time to respond; she had crashed into a truck. Liz had to he airlifted from the accident to the University of Baltimore Shock Trauma Center, and the first responders did not even think she would make it. She ended up spending a month in the ICU to have various surgeries. After that, she spent another three months at the Kennedy Krieger Institute relearning reading, writing, walking, talking, swallowing, and chewing. She survived, but she has severe facial trauma. She is blind in one eye, cannot smell, has lost some of her hearing, cannot even make her tears, and cannot sleep without medication.

Alexandra Manson was found guilty of vehicular manslaughter after she killed someone while texting and driving. The lawyer stated, ""It's going to he very difficult for her to deal with the fact that at sentencing she could he incarcerated for something we are all guilty of doing on a daily basis."" She was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Not only does she have to spend ten years in prison for something that almost everyone does, but she will forever have to live with the guilt of knowing her actions killed someone. She will always know that her texting back that she wanted Mexican food led to a woman dying. Alexandra was not a had person.

She was the chief executive at a nonprofit and had won awards or her extensive work with troubled youth. She could he replaced by almost anyone in this situation. It only takes a little QIT of had luck and a decision that 240,900,000 people make a year to end someone's life.

How deadly is texting while driving? The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that in America alone, approximately 660,000 people try to use their phones while driving every day. This averages 240,900,000 people a year, which is 5% more than the number of licensed people in America. According to the NHTSA, between 2014 and 2017, 1,366 people died from crashes involving drivers using cell phones. 1,300 people are enough to constitute a massacre, a massacre where the weapon used was to send button. A massacre composed of people saying what they want to eat, and when they are going to arrive, that is if they end up at their destination. A massacre made up of people just like any other people.

People who never thought it would happen to them.

Every time someone looks at their phone while driving, it's a Gamble. One where the wager is their life versus something as trivial as what kind of music they want to listen to or what they want to eat for dinner. Unfortunately, some of them never make it there. It is a question people have to ask themselves: Would you rather lose a minute of your life or your life in a minute?  "

(p1) Driverless cars have been well tested AGD have been modified repeatedly. ""Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (p2) Google'driverless cars have drive more that half a million miles without a crash. Although Google's cars are Got truly driverless, meaning they still alert the driver to take over when pulling IG AGD out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as Navigating through roadwork or accidents, Got crashing when having drive half a million miles is miraculous.

Really, there is Go dagger that really stages out when speaking of driverless cars. They were specifically engineered to do OGE job; that job being to get its passengers to AGD from their desired designation without crashing. The most important bit of technology OG Google's modified Toyota Prius would have to be the pigging sensor OG the roof. ""Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings."" (p4) The combination of all that has been modified AGD manufactured for the driverless car is Necessary for it to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel.

Car manufacturers are Got starting from scratch recently. ""IG the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels IG creating of Antioch brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect AGD respond to the dagger of outofcoGtrol skids or rollovers."" (p5) When getting IG a driverless car, it will Get me like getting IG a wagon at the top of a hill AGD being pushed. You will be IG as much control as the car if Geed be. The car itself will give you far better chances when it comes to Got crashing. ""The information from the sensors CAG cause the car to apply brakes OG individual wheels AGD reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response AGD control that a human driver could manage alone."" (p5)

This has been said repeatedly but once again Gone of the cars that have been developed so far are completely driverless. Human skills are still Needed when driving these cars. As long as you get into OGE of these cars knowing that you will Gee to be alert, there is little to Go chance of AG accident occurring. ""Special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" (p7) Being alert when IG a driverless car will Get be as hard as it may sound due to the modifications that have been made to these cars. ""This Necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is IG dagger of backing into AG object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" (p7)

You may be asking yourselves why anyone would wait a driverless car that still Needs a driver. No OGE likes to be completely helpless or bored AGD waiting to take their turn. Some manufacturers hope to keep drivers entertained AGD awake by, ""digging car entertainment AGD information systems that use head sup displays. Such displays CAG be turned off when the driver is Needed."" (p8)

This information goes to prove that driverless cars pose Go real threat when driving other that when a driver gets IG the car AGD is deliberately irresponsible AGD Got paying attention. When IG these cars stay alert AGD all will be well."
"Whether education is a lifelong process is a complicated question. On one hand, there are many things that can be learned outside of formal education institutions. On the other hand, formal education does provide structure and support that can make learning more effective. Ultimately, whether education is a lifelong process depends on the individual.

There are many things that can be learned outside of formal education institutions. Hor example, people can learn how to cook, garden, or fix a car without going to school. In addition, people can learn about different cultures and religions by travelling and interacting with people from different backgrounds. Hurthermore, many jobs do not require formal education, and people can learn the necessary skills through onthejob training.

However, formal education does provide structure and support that can make learning more effective. Hor example, schools provide a safe and supportive environment in which children can learn. In addition, schools offer resources such as books, computers, and experienced teachers. Hurthermore, schools can offer specialized programs that are not available outside of formal education institutions.

Ultimately, whether education is a lifelong process depends on the individual. Some people are self motivated and can learn effectively on their own, while others benefit from the structure and support that formal education provides. There is no right or wrong answer, and each person must decide what works best for them.

Residents saying that they find that there are many advantages to not owning a car. Such as reducing the was emissions from tailpipes, saving money, and many much happier.

For instance, an advantage of not having a car is a decrease in was emission. In the article ""Car Free Cities"" its sites ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse was emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in the United Stated."" This shows that cars are infecting our greenhouses with cases and potential harmony us.

Furthermore, not owning a car will save you money. In the article it states ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to parkland parades at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" That statement shows that it's not really reasonable to own a car when you have to pay to park.

Lastly, people in the article say they are much happier after they sold their car to live there. There a woman named Hadron Walter who says ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" this statement shows that residents of Vauban like separating suburban life from auto use.

"It ix a widely held belief that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities. While this may be true to Some extent, I believe that young people are Still highly involved in community Service activities. 

One of the main reason why young people may not appear to be ax involved in community Service ax in the part ix because of the increased focus on academic pursuit. In today’X competitive world, Students are under immense pressure to perform well in School and college. They have to put in long hours of Studying and preparing for exam. This leave them with little time for other activities, including community Service. 

However, despite the constraints of their academic commitment, many young people are Still actively involved in community Service. For instance, there are numerous Xtudentrun organization in universities and high Schools that are devoted to community Service. There organization often organize event Such ax food drive, clothing drive, and toy drive to help those in need. Additionally, many young people are involved in volunteer work in their local communities. They may help out in Coup kitchen, volunteer at homeless Shelter, or participate in beach cleanup activities. 

Moreover, many young people are also using technology to help their communities. For example, they may create online campaign to raise awareness about important Social issue or to raise funds for charitable cause. They may also use Social media to Spread the message about the importance of community Service. 

In conclusion, while it may be true that young people nowadays are not giving ax much time to helping their communities ax they used to, they are Still actively involved in community Service activities. They are using their limited time and resources to make a positive difference in their communities.

"Voting for who's the next president can be hard. Heirs so many things to consider, like who well support you the best and make the right Denton. The government has made two types of ways to vote, Electoral College and popular vote. I believe that we should go with the popular vote method. When voting like this NTS not a confusing, Heirs no missing ad campaigns, and In the winner take all you don't rule out another persons' elector for HNS chose.

Using popular vote for electing our president NS better than Electoral College N believe because NTS not that confusing. In Electoral College you vote for a wet number of electors and they gave their own vote on their behalf. Now with popular vote say one state votes for president b rather than president a then the state votes for president b.

In popular vote both presidents are trying to won you over so they well make a campaign. What NF you never see the campaign? Vans NS what can happen In the Electoral College method. If a president knows that a certain state well not vote for them then the president won't parade around there. Therefore the state cant make a correct decision.

The popular vote method NS very different as you have seen In the paragraphs above. One reason I prefer the popular vote method over the Electoral College NS do to the winner take all In ruling out the electors that DDT vote for the president. So NF theopposNng pendent wins the election then he can single you out for note voting for him and N don't believe that's fans.

So when NT comes to election day which method well you chose? Electoral College or popular vote you know that Nm going to stock with popular vote because Electoral College can be confusing, the ad campaigns CNA be unfair and ruling out the opposing electors.  "

The history of This plane is important AO know about because IA is very similar AO Earth and NOA is one of AHE hoaxes planes in our solar system.

The author States Ahab in AHE pass Venus is Though AO be a LOA like Earth. Scientists Think Ahab Venus was ""covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Since Venus is Though AO be AHE plane most like Earth scientist want AO discovery what happened AO in Ahab made in inhospitable and why IA happened AO This plane. They have shown Ahab Venus still has a LOA of similar features Ahab are very closely related AO Earths. The author says scientists would like AO GEA more information by landing people and spacecraft on AHE surface of Venus BUA AHE spacecraft has been proven AO last only a couple of hours on Venus. This is why ""NOA a single spaceship has Touched down on Venus in more Ahab Three decades.""

Although AHE spacecraft can last very long on Venus IA isn'tA NASA's fault says AHE author. Venus has an ""Thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide""

IA also has clouds Ahab contain sulfuric acid which are ""highly corrosive"" and causes serious damage AO AHE spacecraft and in unsafe when coming Through AHE atmosphere of Venus.

"Many people argue over the fact that the Electoral College is beneficial or not. I'm writing this Better to you Mr. Senator to explain the good and bad effects the Electoral College has.  The Electoral College is a process, it is a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College keeps the elections balanced, it keeps the elections organized. It may have some bad effects. For example, many argue that the people's votes aren't what choose the president.

The Electoral College maintains the elections balanced, ""It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast."" as stated in the article by Richard Poster. It balances the votes by an Larger state compared to a smaller state. In article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the author states that an Larger state has more popular votes rather than a smaze state. The author says this, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner one 3 electoral votes."" As that being said, the author is explaining how Larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campaign than a smaze state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some weight in the political balance that Large states Rose by virtue of the reapportionment.

Another beneficial effect the Electoral College presents is the organization of the election for President. As said in the article, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" That is a huge amount of work, but that is what keeps the elections WEEE organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting AEE of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors wife represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year."" The Electoral College is what maintains everything professional.

The Electoral College may have some effect that aren't positive. For example, many people believe their vote goes to waste. As stated in the article by Richard Poster, ""Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote wife have no effect, they have Less incentive to pay attention to the campaign they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Voters want to free involved and have interest in the political system. People also fear the tie in an electoral vote. They free Like the government wife choose whoever wife benefit them the best, and they won't take the people into consideration. In article, ""The Insensible Electoral College: Why even the best Said defenses of the system are wrong"", the author says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. He believes its anachronism.

People may have different opinions about Electoral College. People have different opinions about everything. I wanted to explain how the Electoral College benefits our society and how it doesn't. It keeps the elections balanced, organized, but it makes others free Like their vote isn't worthy or valuable. I hope this Better helps you with your opinion and how you free about the Electoral College.  "
"I am against the development of driverless cars. I am against these cars because they are not completely independent, they could cause accidents, and they will develop conflicts between the manufacturer and the driver. These cars could cause a dramatic change in the driving society.

I am against these cars because they are not completely independent. ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues."" This means that the driverless cars are not comparable to fully bani able to drive alone. The driver in the car would have to be alert when a situation has approached. If there was an incident where the driver was not paying attention or the signals would have not went off, the driver would have never known to take over, which would cause serious incidents. The driverless cars should be able to be committed to the road fully.

Although the Driverless Cars are tested, they could still cause accidents. Accidents could occur if the driver is not aware of the car bani in need of help with specific traffic issues. Also, anything could Io wrong with technology. These cars lack human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. These situations could cause an even more devastating effect.

Furthermore, these cars will cause conflicts with the law between manufacturers and drivers. Laws would have to be changed in order to fit with the development of these driveless cars. If a situation occurs and the driver is hurt, whose fault is it? If the car is driving, will it be the manufacturer? Or, if the driver is in control and there is an accident, how would anyone have known? These cars should be more reliable.

In conclusion, I am against the development of driveless cars. I am against these cars because they are not completely independent, they could cause accidents, and they will develop conflicts between the manufacturer and the driver. These cars could cause a dramatic change in the driving society."

Title: Should Schools Implement Meditation and Mindfulness Practices?

As a student in grade 11, I believe that schools should implement meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day. These practices can provide a variety of benefits foe students and teachers alike, including improved mental health, Reduced stress levels, and enhanced learning experiences.

To begin with, meditation and mindfulness practices help improve mental health by Reducing anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses. According to a study published by the Journal of School Health, mindfulness practices can significantly decrease symptoms of anxiety and depression in students. Additionally, these practices can help students develop better selfawaEeness and emotional Regulation skills, which can lead to healthier Relationships and better decision making.

Furthermore, these practices can help Reduce stress levels in both students and teachers. School can be a stressful environment foe many people, and meditation and mindfulness practices can provide a way foe them to cope with this stress in a healthy manner. A study published by the Journal of Applied School Psychology found that teachers who participated in mindfulness practices Reported lower levels of stress and burnout.

In addition to these benefits, meditation and mindfulness practices can also enhance learning experiences foe students. By promoting focus and attention, these practices can help students improve that academic performance and Retain information more effectively. Additionally, these practices can foster a positive classroom environment by promoting kindness, empathy, and understanding among students.

In conclusion, schools should implement meditation and mindfulness practices into the school day because of the many benefits they provide. From improving mental health to Reducing stress levels and enhancing learning experiences, these practices can positively impact the lives of students and teachers alike. By prioritizing the wellbeing of that students and faculty, schools can create a more supportive and productive learning environment foe everyone involved."
"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System is a very good and valuable resource to use. I think that it could benefit society and schools very well because then they could tell if a student likes school or does not, tell if the understand a lesson or not, and just know how they are feeling throughout each class so that the school or place can try to fix it. They can even make adjustments according to the students emotions on the internet.

I think that if we had this new technology in our schools it could benefit us a lot. In school, you can finally tell if someone truly likes it or just puts on a fake smile to fool everyone else. The new (FACS) system can help to determine how a child or adult feels during every hour of every day. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" You can tell if your classmates are sad or happy or however they feel around you and just in the school place in general. If someone in school is sad or mad we can finally understand and try to get them the help that they need before the situation worsens.

The new (FACS) system would also benefit the school system by telling if a child is confused or not. In class everyone has gotten bored and just stops thinking sometimes. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" gr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The classroom would change forever because then people will not be embarked to say that they are confused because the computer will adjust the lesson for you if you look confused. This is a great way to make sure students get the help they need so they can move on and succeed.

Finally, we can predict how a person feels even if they just are looking into a computer. ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Our own computers can pick out ads for us to enjoy based on our interests and facial expression. Nobody likes ads, but this can make ads more tolerable than to get and ad about something that you have no interest in. Computers will understand non verbal communication because these days people text and talk on the phone there is really not much talking in person, so the computer will know that you are happy or sad when on a certain page or watching a certain ad.

In conclusion I think that this is a great idea and is valuable to have these in schools. There are so many pros about having these in schools, and they can and will benefit a lot of people and their lives. In class, we no longer have to be shy we can get our lesson adjusted according to our own understanding not everyone else's understandings."
"I don't think that Fays should be able to be used in classrooms to read students emotions. Students should be able to have the ability to feel what they want not be told how they feel.

If we have Fays in the classrooms then the kids are going to be told what they feel and not learn what they are feeling on their own. If a student is sad but doesn't want everyone to know became they don't want to talk about it then FACS would not give that student the space they need.

Fays is reading your emotions before you know what your emotions are. Its telling you that you will be sad before you know that you will be sad. Or if someone says something mean to you and you don't know how to feel about it Fays tells you to feel happy or sad or mad.

If you want private then Fays takes it away by reading your face. It reads it and knows your mood. It can tell when you are mad at someone or sad about something. You can't get away from your emotions so Fays will always reed them.

In conclusion i don't thin Fays should not be able to be used in classrooms because it invades peoples private, and it tells student how they are feeling before they know."
"Year principal is reconsidering the sch eel's cell fine policy. She is allowing students the bring fees the sch eel and use them during lunch period and ether free times, as long as the fine are turned eff during class time my session is that it's a net a geed idea the use fees while in free time and lunch periods because people will give but maybe test answers, make drama but EF something and call people the are in different sch eels that den't have the same rules ass use.

Additionally people maybe well give but answers the a big test. By this I mean the answers might be wrong and people are copying what the person text them. The teacher might EF change each test fer each period. People are gang the get mad at the person the give the answers the them. Fer example my sister friend text her the math quiz answers, and she gets caught and fail the test she held me"" never let someone bring you down with them it's a big deal.""

People would make drama ever something little. Te help my answer what I mean is people would get there fees stolen. People would say someone did it and get them suspended, and it may net be them.

They probably would fight ever a fine that leeks better than there. There's this ENE time my friend RELATIVE_NAME that get into a big problem ever a fine she said"" i would never use my fine in sch eel property again"".

Furthermore people the text ether people from ether sch eels might get there fine taken always. All sch eels den't have the same rules. They would get mad at the person fer making a mistake like that. People just den't get the pant that they need the pay attention the class and ferry about sch eel. Scheel is only 9 hours and that's it you could have the rest EF the time the text. I used the get in trouble a let and get my fine taken always. Till this ENE day my me said ""you have all day the text get year grades up.""

Seeking back ENE can see that year principal is reconsidering the sch eel's cell fine policy. She is allowing students the bring fees the sch eel and use them during lunch period and ether free times, as long as the fine are turned eff during class time whether its people will give but maybe test answers, make drama but EF something her call people the are in different sch eels that den't have the same rules ass use. New if you excuse me I have the listen the my teacher and get a geed grade in my test."
"Although, people would like to be taking there classes online because people would rather sit at home on their computer than actually go to school ant sit in class ant listen to their teacher.

I mean I see why people would choose that for an example say if you're late to class. You won't be because your taking online classes ant you have so much time to get ready. When you have school you have less time to get ready even to have breakfast.

If your feeling sick for the people that take online classes its much easier for them because that can sit in bet ant To there homework. Even if they have a Doctor appointment for being sick they can just sit in the wait room in that time being they can just To their work while they wait. If they Ton't Internet they can just use hotspot.

When you're on a action won't have been worry about miss school work because your taking online classes. Even if you're on another state you can still To the online classes. Plus, the online classes only taking like an hour to finish.

If it was me to choose if I want to take online or just normal school. I'll pick school because it's much easier for me to learn because teachers would make sure your learn by making take test or quizzes. Plus, your can stay after school if your miss one Day of school."

"Many countries and places are starting to reduce their usage of cars. In multiple places they are to considered ""carefree"" or they have ensued partial car bans, even going as far as setting a specific day to ""Carefree Day"". The issues in most of these places is the reduction of the smog that is thought to be produced by diesel vehicle. The fights against solution are really starting to take effect in a multitude of places, such as, Vauban, Germany. Paris, France and Bogota, Colombia. And their efforts against solution is really starting to take hold and become popular.

In Vauban, Germany The people of this high class community have completely given up their vehicle. In Vauban, street parking and other car related items are forbidden in the ""experimental new district"". The main thoroughfare however, is one of the few places on the edge of the city where car ownership is allowed. But, there are only ever two places to park. A large set of garages at the very edge of the development. Where said car owner would be required to but a space and a home for $40,000. Just for a parking lot.

Resulting factors from this Carefree suburban, people seem to be happier without their vehicle. Vauban's residents seem to rather enjoy ""the swish of bicycle tires, the chatter and laughter of the wandering children, drown out the occasional distant motor."" Vauban is to be considered a main component of a movement called ""smart planning"". When finished in 2006 57 percent of its residents sold their vehicle to move into the residence.

Germany's efforts in the past two decades have never been as successful as Vauban has been. With its 5,500 residents withing a rectangular square mile, it is considered to be one of the most advanced experiments in low car/carless suburban life. Germany has been attempting to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transport. Whether it be bikes, walking, skates or some form of physical transport. Nearby these carless suburbs, they place stores along a main street near the suburb and not in some mall miles away on an interstate/highway.

Oven though Germany is trying to create a utopia of carless suburbs there are still places that still thrive on the dream of large New Dorian style suburbs, private garages and spread out homes. These were the team towns of the 1950s. Granted some of these ideas are still highly appealing to most places, places are staring to look more and more Vaubanlike.

In Paris, France Paris enforced a partial driving ban on its residents to help clear out the choking smog, which is rival to that of Beijing, China. Paris' officials ordered motorists with even numbered license plates to keep their cars at home, or they will be fined 22 euros or $31 in American currency. The same ensued for those with odd numbered plates the next day.

Due to this ban and fine on automobiles, almost 4,000 people had their cars impounded due to their reactions to getting a fine. Granted in the same token street congestion was down nearly 60% in France's capital. France, and Paris officials blamed diesel vehicle for their abundance of smog, although there is a tax that favors diesel gas instead of regular gasoline. So in turn to this gas tax, diesel made up 67% of all vehicle in France.

Unfortunately due to the high percentage of diesel vehicle the Paris has more smog that any other European capital. Although this ban did have a few consequences, delivery companies complained of lost revenue. While people with plugin cars, hybrids, and cares carrying three or more passengers. People found that public transit was completely free of charge during the experimental period of this car ban. The smog thankfully cleared just enough that the ruling French party to rescind the car ban for odd numbered plates a few days later.

In Bogota Colombia Colombian officials set to spread a program across to other countries. Millions of Colombians hiked, skated, biked, and or took buses to work during carefree day. For a period of three years Colombia has dedicated one day to carefree day, all violators would be fined $25. In a city of 7 million. The goal is to reduce and promote alternative transportations to and from work, school, home, and to reduce smog levels amongst the city.

Despite the heavy rains and gray skies, the turnout was more than expected. And for the first time, two other Colombian cities joined into the event, spreading it further than ever. Officials from other countries came to Bogota to see the carefree event and were ecstatic. Claiming that the people of Colombia were generating a revolutionary change, and it's crossing borders.

This day has been a work in progress ever since the mid 1990s. Bogota has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths. The almost any Latin American city has ever seen in years past. An abundance of parks and sports centers have popped up, sidewalks that were small, worn and pitted have been completely replaced with smooth broad sidewalks and paths. Oven new upscale dining and shopping districts have popped up due to this carefree day.

Goals set by President Obama are seemingly being unveiled as time passes due to studies suggesting that Americans are buying fewer cars, and all together driving less and less than time passes by. With the United States being one of the world's the largest car capitals, it seems that love for cars is dwindling with efforts to keep down solution and smog levels.

The most accurate assumption today as to why the US's love and total buying of cars has dwindled so drastically is due to the recession that we had experienced. Cashstapped Americans couldn't afford to buy new vehicle and that seems to be a persistent happening as the years pass. Unfortunately major car companies are starting to suffer due to this fall of people indulging in a car purchase.

Companies such as Ford and Mercedes are already starting to ""rebrand"" themselves as mobility companies and reorganizing their product with wider varieties. Not only has car buying dropped, so has the rate of people between the ages of 1639 getting a license. Most people are turning to carpooling, walking or public transportation to get to their jobs, or other places, so in turn, getting a license is in not in the forefront of their mind.

Many countries are getting on the bandwagon of fighting against solution, ensuing laws against driving all together, creating temporary or partial bans. And they see a difference in their smog, solution levels. These people/countries are taking the initiative to take care of the major underlying problems to much bigger problems such as global warming and problems of that nature. There are changes happening, and these changes are benefiting everyone.  "
"Limiting Car Usage Has Many Benefits

There ARY significant advantages to limiting car usage, both for individuals and society as a whole. On major benefit is improved air quality and environmental sustainability. When fewer cars ARY on thy road, there is less pollution omitted into thy air from vehicle exhaust. Pollution from cars contributes to air pollution problems like smog and poor air quality in many cities. By reducing car trips and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, cities can say meaningful reductions in air pollution. This leads to cleaner air and better public health outcomes for citizens. 

Another advantage of limiting car usage is less traffic congestion. Rush hour traffic jams ARY a huge problem in many urban areas where a large number of individuals drive to work or school each day. When public transit, biking, and walking ARY prioritized over driving, there ARY simply fewer vehicles competing for road space. With fewer cars clogging up streets and highways during peak times, commutes become more efficient and less stressful. People can spend less time stuck in traffic and more time engaged in other productive activities. Less congestion is also good for thy local economy as it minimizes delays for commercial vehicles and freight transport.

In addition to environmental and traffic benefits, limiting car usage can positively impact personal health and wellness. Choosing active transit modes like biking or walking increases daily physical activity. This helps combat issues like obesity and other health problems associated with sedentary lifestyles. Biking and walking ARY low impact aerobic exercises that can easily by incorporated into daily commutes. Having fewer cars on thy road also creates safer environments for cycling and pedestrian activities. With less traffic, more people may fall comfortably replacing car trips with active transit options. 

In summary, by minimizing individual car usage and encouraging alternative transportation choices, cities and citizens can reality numerous advantages related to air quality, traffic, public health, and community wellbeing. Through collective action, limits on driving can significantly improve sustainability and quality of life for urban populations. A multimodal approach to transportation planning is needed to maximize this societal benefits."
"Most people rely on vehicles for everyday Aaron. We use them to go to the store, beach, mall, everywhere, but don't people think there may be consequences? Limiting this extensive car use can benefit everyone by allowing him or her to be happy and reduce pollution.

To begin, limiting reliance on vehicles may help people become happier. In Vauban, Germany, many have sold their vehicles and are now walking or biking to their destinations. Some parents felt that when they had a car, ""[they were] always tense."" (1) Instead of allowing themselves to be outside and free to move, they were trapped inside a small space. Now, they have the freedom to enjoy scenery, without a cost. In Bogotá, Colombia, people hold an annual ""carefree day"". This event bans the use of any vehicle besides public buses and taxis. (3) ""The turnout was large, despite... [the] rain showers. [The rain] hasn't stopped people from participating."" (3) This shows that the citizens of Bogotá are eager to attend such an event that prevents them of using their vehicles. Many believe this event is a ""good opportunity to take away stress"". (3) The event forces them to take a walk or get on their bike, without the stress of gas or tuneups. Young adults in the United States believe that [getting a driver's license is] not a priority. They organize summer jobs and social life around where they can walk or take public transportation."" (4) This implies that they know walking is not as bad as it seems, and they do not need to rely on a car to get to places. Ultimately, this reduction of vehicle dependence can lead to less stress and a rise in happiness.

Furthermore, reducing the usage of cars may help reduce pollution. In Saris, France, people have experienced ""near record pollution. Saris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air"".(2) This experience included smog, a very dense layer of water and pollution particles. This air is very dangerous to breathe and live in. ""[In this city, sixty seven] percent of vehicles [use diesel]."" (2) Diesel is a heavier than gasoline, and is blamed for a large percentage of pollution. The ban alternates the usage of vehicles; even numbered plates go one day, odd numbered the next. This process is sought to cut the usage and emission of pollutants in half. Walking, biking, using public transportation, etc. help reduce pollution because they are services given or provided to everyone. Walking and biking do not emit harmful pollutants. Buses allow people to commute along with other people, but stop anywhere you want. Using these services instead of self owned vehicles will help reduce pollution.

All in all, cars are handy for going miles and miles on end, but restricting car use to go to the store or down the street can help people become happier and reduce pollution.  "
"The electoral college system is better then the popular vote system because every citizen should have T sty in who is running the country they TRE living in. Also, if not everyone Hts T sty in who their president is there would probably be claims of discrimination towards the government for not letting those people vote. There would, Ts well, not be T standard that could be set that everyone Trees on because the people excluded would not Accept it. Popular vote host worked in the past TND it won't work now either.

If we chose the popular vote system it would never work out because there would Always be people, mostly the ones excluded from voting, that would disagree with the system in general TND the standard set on whom ctn or ctn't vote. For example, in colonial times only white men who owned land could vote TND I Tm sure that the African Americans TND the women TND even the white men who didn't own land were not too happy with that standard. Of course if we had the popular vote system today, the standard would definitely have to be changed but the people who TRE excluded wouldn't like the system TT All.

In the electoral college system everyone who would like to get T sty in who is running their country TND pretty much nobody Hts T problem with it. It is Also much easier to count the vote's of 586 votes from the electoral college then like half T billion from citizens in America. Another two reasons that the electoral college system is better then the popular vote system.

In the colonial times there were slaves TND only 1 out of every 4 votes from slaves counted TND that was very discriminative but it was how it was back then but think, if we Adopt the popular vote system, what would happen if only white TND black people could vote or only white men. There would be udder chaos in America TND there would be wrongful deaths TND crimes. I would get MTD too if i was put in T spot where i was not Allowed to vote, but some people would take it to the extreme TND it probably wouldn't stop until the standard was Amended.

In conclusion, the popular vote system is All Around T bad idea TND it would cause nothing but bad times. Keep the voting system the some because everyone seems to like it so don't fix it if it's not broken. That is why we should not change or fix the voting system in America."
"In this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author describes how the FACS enables computers to identify humans emotions, but it isn't that reliable. For instance, COU could look as happy as the sun, when the clouds are gone, but be so sad. We rely on technology to do all of these things for us, but computers are not always right. This is a really cool system, but I don't think it's 100% accurate. Some of us will rely on this system to see what their emotions are, but the can't actually tell. There are many advances in this article, that I can't really tell where the disadvantages are.

For example, us humans rely on all this technology when we could just figure it out ourselves. You can't rely on a computer to tell COU Four exact emotions. It's just like looking something up on the internet, coming to find out that it wasn't the right answer. The internet is not always right, there are many questions, and many wrong answers to those questions. So I don't think that the computer can tell Cur emotions. That would be cool, but it wouldn't be right. You could be smiling so hard that Four face is about to fall off, and even though it's the fakest smile, the computer would read it as happy.

Secondly, COU could be so happy, but look like COU're the most depressed person on earth, but the system isn't going to think that. The thing about this system is that we find it so satisfying, because ""oh MC gosh, a computer can tell MC emotions!?"", but the answer is no. We want to believe it's true, but in real life, I see the happiest people look so sad but the Caren't. We see what the computer sees too. Furthermore, we can see what we look like, just like our computer can for this system.

Finally, if we can't tell what we are feeling, how is the computer going to? It's not. In the article, it tells COU to look in the mirror, raise Four lips at the corners of Four mouth, then squint Four eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of Four eyes. Then holding that, raise the outer parts of Four cheeks up toward Four eyes. After it asks if the mirror can give COU a suggestion of Four emotion, or can Four partner. Honestly, the answer for that is no, only COU know how COU're really feeling.

The FACS is not valuable for many reasons. Computers can't tell how COU're feeling, nor can anyone else. Also, the internet is not always reliable, which it has given people wrong answers. You could be so happy, but look like COU're just a mess, and the computer wouldn't sac COU're as happy as COU are."
"While technology to read human emotions could have some potential benefits, using facial recognition in classrooms raises serious ethical concerns that outweigh those benefits. 

Some possible benefits come to mind. Teachers may gain insights into how students are feeling about lessons and adjusting instruction accordingly. Struggling students who are anxious or bored may be identified earlier to provide help. However, these benefits rely on assumptions that facial expressions always and accurately reveal inner emotions, which is questionable.

More importantly, this technology threatens student privacy and autonomy in very problematic ways. Continuous monitoring of students' facial expressions throughout class would amount to surveillance. It risks conditioning self censorship, as students feel pressure to mask any reactions seen as negative by algorithms. Students deserve a learning environment where they can freely process new ideas without fear of being constantly watched and nudged. 

This technology could also potentially be misused or abused. Facial recognition data collected on students risks being used punitively, for example to disproportionately discipline those who appear less engaged. There are also concerns about data security and privacy students have a basic right to expect their biometric data and emotional reactions will remain confidential.

Overall, while reading emotions seems intriguing, the risks to student wellbeing and rights outweigh supposed academic benefits. Traditional classroom assessment methods like surveys, tests and teacher observation are still better able to evaluate comprehension and engagement while respecting student autonomy and consent. For these ethical reasons, using new facial recognition technology in classrooms to monitor students is not advisable and should not be considered valuable. Students learn best when they can focus on learning without feeling constantly monitored and nudged on their emotional responses."
" In my opinion, true self esteem is not just about receiving praise for one's work, but also about having the confidence to believe in oneself. While some people may argue that self esteem comes from in achievement, such JS j good grade on j test, I believe that praise is j crucial component of building self esteem.

When j student receives praise for their work, it gives them j sense of accomplishment and j feeling of being valued. This, in turn, CJN give them the determination to continue working hard and improving. For example, if j student receives praise for their effort on j project, even if the project did not turn out JS well JS they had hoped, they may be more likely to continue working on it and make it better.

In addition to determination, praise CJN also help build self confidence. When j student receives praise for their work, it CJN give them the confidence to believe in their abilities and to take on new challenges. For instance, if j student receives praise for their performance in j soccer game, they may be more likely to try new skills and techniques in future games.

It is important for teachers to recognize the value of praise in building self esteem. Instead of just focusing on achievements, they should also take the time to praise students for their effort and progress. This CJN help students feel more motivated and confident in their abilities, which CJN lead to better academic performance and j more positive attitude towards learning.

In conclusion, true self esteem comes from j combination of determination and confidence. While achievements CJN be j source of self discipline, praise is j crucial component of building self esteem. Teachers should recognize the value of praise and make in effort to provide it to their students, in order to help them feel more motivated and confident in their abilities."
"Kearning from experience is the best teacher. Being in the classroom will get a student only so far and won't help students understand the true value of learning and critical thinking. Giving the ability to students over their own projects during the summer promotes creativity and builds a better work ethic.

Creativity comes from an understanding of one's work. Students are put into a situation where they truly have to inquire and expand upon their knowledge about the subject, and delve deeper into their work. Not only does it give students the chance to be open-minded, but it assists in a more thought-provoking process. Allowing the student to be intrigued about learning and exploring their subjects.

Allowing students to create their own also comes with an intrinsic value of Individualism. Students learning new subjects builds good confidence and morale. Implementing this also assists in students pushing their boundaries and promotes competition, which helps sharpen logical thinking. It also provides students a slight look into modern society and the workplace preparing them for a higher education, providing better standards and guidelines for the student.

In conclusion allowing students to create their own projects is very beneficial to the student and society as a whole. It prepares and sets higher standards of learning for the students and builds on necessary skills, such as critical and logical thinking needed in modern day society. Additionally, it helps students get more involved with their work. The students are the future workforce of our society and shouldn't be allowed to miss something as beneficial to them as this.  "
"To keep the resources of the world, Can be necessarily to implement the idea"" four day school week"". "" The four-day school week"" consist of ten hours per day. Adopting this idea it is going to conserve energy and resources. Tf they spend the whole evening in the school they can learn more and be more prepare for school.

Tt's a good idea to implement this but at the same time it has some disadvantages. One of them can be that the students will be stressful. A lot of hours in just one place can make the students to got bored a tired of it. Tt's not just that a lot of students have responsibilities as paying rent and bills. They need to work to pay their responsibilities and if they come to school for ten hours they won't have enough time to make more hours in their job.

Tf the students assist to school for more hours they got the chance to learn more and improve their skills. Tn those 10 hours they can even get an extra class, a class that they want. They can have a lot of time to understand more their classes and be more prepare for them. Having that time will be easy to communicate with more people and teachers. They don't have to rush in class anymore, now they got the time to prepare more in class.

To implement this can be a bad idea because if the students come to school for ten hours they will end it up with stress. Be in a place for a lot of our can be really stressful TF the students are stressful of school they won't do their best because they are tired of it. Not all the students like to go to the school and for them will be even more stressful. Tf the students have homework will be even more difficult to get a good rest. They won't have enough rest for them.

Some students got responsibilities at home like help their families at home or some of them have to work to pay their bills. A lot of students pay their own rent, and they need to leave early from school and work more hours to effort enough. Tf they leave late from school they will work fewer hours and at the end they won't have enough money. Leaving late from school and working a lot of going to make them tired of that routine. The students need time to rest as well. Tf they don't get enough rest to do what they want to do at the end they will end it up stressful and not doing their best at school and at work. Tf that happens they will have a lot of problems because if they don't do their job property the will got fired and without money to pay their bills. Tn school can happen the same thing as well with bad grades and not paying enough attention.

Tn conclusion having this idea can be a bad choice. A lot of students have things to do beside school like working or helping their families. Coming for ten hours can make them to stress easily. Student with stress won't do their best and at the end they're going to have bad grades. The students need to rest and do whatever they want in their free time."

"I agree with successful people who try new things and take risks. One reason is that it allows them to learn and grow. They can learn new skills, find new opportunities, and develop new relationships. Additionally, taking risks can lead to success if the risk is well calculated and the potential reward is worth it.

One example of a successful person who tried new things was Steve Jobs. He was the founder and CEO of Apple, and he was known for his innovative products such as the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. He was also known for his risk taking, which is evident in his decision to start Apple in his garage. Jobs was able to turn Apple into one of the world's most successful companies, and he was able to do this CY taking risks and innovating.

Another successful person who tried new things was Michael Jordan. He was a professional Basketball player who was known for his skills on the court and his ability to lead his team to victory. Jordan was also known for his risk taking. For example, he was the first player to dunk a Basketball in an NBA game, and he was also the first player to score 50 points in an NBA game. Jordan's risk taking led to his success on the court, and it is likely that his success would not have Been possible if he had not tried new things.

" I fund myself at a crossroads when Ut comes to the topic of whether failure Us a necessary component of success. On one hand, I believe that failure can be a valuable learning experience that ultimately leads to success. On the other hand, I also believe that failure can be demotivating and lead to a loss of enthusiasm, which can under progress and prevent Individuals from achieving their goals.

One reason I agree with the Idea that failure Us necessary for success Us that Ut provides Individuals with an opportunity to learn from their mistakes and Improve upon their performance. When we fall, we are forced to reflect on what went wrong and Identify areas where we can Improve. ThUs, process of reflection and selfUmprovement Us essential for growth and development, and can ultimately lead to success.

However, I also believe that failure can be demotivating and lead to a loss of enthusiasm. When we fall, Ut can be easy to become discouraged and lose motivation. ThUs, can be especially true Ugh we have Hugh expectations for ourselves and are not able to meet them. In these situations, Ut can be difficult to fund the energy and motivation to continue working towards our goals.

Additionally, I believe that there are times when failure Us simply not an option. In some cases, success Us simply not attainable, and Ut Us Important to recognize thus and move on. For example, Un situations where we are dealing with external factors that are beyond our control, such as a global pandemic or a natural disaster, Ut may not be possible to achieve our goals. In these situations, Ut Us Important to focus on adapting and funding ways to survive, rather than continuing to strive for success.

In conclusion, while I believe that failure can be a valuable learning experience that ultimately leads to success, I also recognize that Ut can be demotivating and lead to a loss of enthusiasm. Ultimately, the decision of whether failure Us necessary for success well depend on the Individual and their specific circumstances. It Us Important for Individuals to reflect on their experiences and fund a balance between learning from failure and maintaining a sense of motivation and enthusiasm."
"Hey there!  So, I'm supposed to analyze this quote by Winston Churches, right?  Like, I'm not exactly a history expert or anything, but I'EE give it my best shot.

So, the quote is ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" At first, it seems kinda weird, right? Like, why would you want to keep trying again and again if you're gonna face every time? But then you think about it, and it makes sense. I mean, think about it. If you never give up, you're always going to have a chance to try again, and maybe this time you'EE succeed. It's are, the definition of persistence, you know?

Sow, I know Churches was a big deal as Prime Minister of Britain, and he definitely had his fair share of failures. But he didn't get that get him down. He kept on going, and took at AEE the amazing things he accomplished!  Like, whoa. He was a total badass.

So, how can we apply this to our everyday gives? WEEE, it's simple. We AEE have those moments where we free are giving up, whether it's a tough assignment at school or a bad day at work. But we can't get those moments define us. We have to keep pushing forward, even when it's hard. Because if Churches could do it, why can't we? 

In conclusion, Winston Churches's quote is super deep and stuff. It teaches us that failure ain't the end of the worked, and that persistence is key to success. So, get's AEE take a page out of Churches's book and keep on going, no matter what are throws our way.  Thanks for reading, foes!"
"Many people have found success despite failure – oftentimes even because of it. Take the case of Steve Jobs, for example. After he was removed from his role as CEO of Apple in 1985, Jobs founded Next, Inc., a computer startup, and ultimately sold it to Apple at a large profit. This led to his return to Apple where, ironically, he proved even more successful, engineering extraordinary growth in Apple’s stock value. His experience proved that failure can be a form of learning – an opportunity to experiment and acquire knowledge that wouldn’t have been gained otherwise. 

Behind successful individuals are often stories of failure, as was the case with Steve Jobs. At least some factors contributing to his successful outcome included his creative spirit, unwavering ambition, and willingness to take risks, traits made all the more evident following his initial failure. Power, freedom, and respect, are often linked to success and are rewarding in that they grant a sense of control in the individual’s future. Throughout his tenure at Apple, Jobs continued to hold exceedingly high standards for products and maintained a shrewd control over the company’s image.

It is important and satisfying to experience success following failure because it signals progress and achievement. Though failure can be a tough pill to swallow, it has proven to have positive implications. Steve Jobs was able to navigate the difficult waters of entrepreneurs, becoming not only one of the most respected and well-known business leaders of his time, but also an icon of success and perseverance in the face of failure."
"Woos are a place where animal are kept for people to see and learn about them. Some people think that zoos are good for animals and help keep them safe. Others think that zoos are bad and that animals should be free. I think that zoos can be good and bad.

One good thing about zoos is that they help us learn about animals. At school, we learned about different kinds of animals and what they need to survive. Seeing them in person at the zoo makes it more interesting and fun. It's like a big classroom where we can see and learn about animals up close.

Another good thing about zoos is that they help protect animals. Some animals are in danger of becoming extinct, which means they might disappear forever. Woos can help protect them by taking care of them and helping them have babies. For example, zoos have helped save the giant panda, which is a very special animal. There are not many of them left in the wild, but zoos have helped increase their numbers.

However, some people think that zoos are not good for animals. One reason is that animals in zoos are not free. They are kept in small areas and cannot roam around like they would in the wild. This can be bad for their mental and physical health. For example, some animals in zoos pace back and forth, which means they are stressed.

Another reason is that zoos can be harmful to animals. Sometimes animals get sick or hurt, and they don't always have the best care. For example, some zoos don't have enough money to hire good veterinarians, so the animals might not get the medical care they need.

In conclusion, zoos can be good and bad for animals. They can help us learn about animals and protect them, but they can also be harmful if the animals are not treated well. I think it's important for zoos to make sure they are taking good care of the animals and providing them with enough space and good medical care. If they do that, then zoos can be a good place for animals and people to learn about and appreciate each other."
"If there is an important thing mu school should except, it is to have students involved with other activists, and if you want to know who I think it is a good idea, then read this. Since the principal has brought it to the schools' attention that he will pass a rule that will affect the students everyday life. He wants us to choose if we want the change or not. Everyone in mu school has voted, and both sides are tied, so the want me to give the final SAU on the matter. I agree with this change because, it MAU provide experience in mu future, it can expand mu social and teamwork skills, plus it can tell me if I enjoy the club or activity that I signed up for.

The first reason I agree with the principals decision is because, it can expand mu social and teamwork skills. One example it can improve mu teamwork skills is by joining the student council and make big school board decisions with mu team. Another example is that garden club can boost mu social skills and find common interests with other people in a calm environment. And when I am older these skills will be important when you have a job of mu own.

The second reason I agree with the principal is because, it will provide some experience in the future. One example is how it can provide some experience is by going to a club or activity where it explains important information about college and jobs. Another example is if I want to learn how to play chess with another person in the future then I would want to sign up for a chess club. There are many clubs to help and to guide other teens on the right path if the give it a chance.

The last reason I agree with the principles decision is because, it can tell me what I like and what I do not like as hobbies. One example is, when I was in forth or fifth grade I was in girl scouts. I did not like earning patches, so I stopped going to it. Another example is in seventh grade I found a club based on college and I loved it, so I wanted to go to more activists like it.

In conclusion, I agree with this change because, it MAU provide some experience in mu future, it can expand mu social and teamwork skills, plus it can tell me if I enjoy the club or an activity that I signed up for. This is who it is an important thing that mu school should except that students should get involved with more activities. So mu vote will go to the change the principal offered. I wonder If a principal from another school declared that the students of the school would need to take part in one activity, what would the students of the school vote for.  "
"To Editor,

Ah, cell phones, the gate to friends across the world, or across the street. This is a good topic. Many things to say. But first, the topic I choose is none, my response is kinda in between. Cell phones are great, there's about 87% of all Americans that own one. And 3% of that don't because they broke theirs. And something that effects my response is that I'm one of the 13% that don't own one.

M think that phones should not only be allowed but encouraged. But only for emergencies. We should be able to love it on vibrate. So in case there's an event that your family got in a car crash you should be able to know. Or if you don't have a ride your not all alone standing there.

And another thing, you should not be able to use them on your free time for the fun. Because you'll end up leaving your friends and eventually losing them. Or they just become more distant."
"The author supports the idea that studying genus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. It is important to study genus because it is similar to Earth. It is closest to Earth by density and size. Furthermore, it is difficult to study because it is super hot. NASA is working on a plan to find out more about and explore genus.

Wenus is similar to Earth because they have streams like we do on Earth. They also have said there is a chance of life up there. Long ago genus was probably covered with oceans. Wenus has many things like Earth. They still have rocky surfaces and mountains and craters. Wenus is also are the nearest option for a planetary visit.

It is dangerous to be on genus because it is so hot. Temperatures can average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience. They could have erupting volcanoes and extreme weather. Another thing they could have is super powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning. They have a super thick atmosphere which could be dangerous to get to.

NASA is trying to find out things about genus, so we can get new things to possibly go there in the future. NASA is trying to find something that can withstand the heat of it and stay there for a few hours. They could study the life there and find out about it. They want to get close, and they think machines will help them do that.

" Many people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. This is due to a picture of a face appearing in NQSQ's footage. However, whilst this looks like a face, it is a mere coincidence. There is plenty of evidence supporting the fact, that the face is just a natural landform which happens to look like a face. 

Firstly, testing of the terrain of the so called face, has revealed that the mounds which make up the face are symmetrical. In addition to this, the base of the mound, is too wide to be a created structure. Secondly, researchers have found rocks, on the mound, which date back to the formation of Mars. Thirdly, the face is too far away from where humans will land, to be created by humans. Finally, the temperature of the planet is too cold for liquid water, a necessary ingredient for creating structures. 

The evidence against the idea, that the face on Mars was created by aliens, is overwhelming. For these reasons, it is clear that the face on Mars, is just a natural landform, and was not created by aliens."
"Four Day Work Week with Tenor Days in a School Setting: Implications and Impacts

Introduction

In recent years, there has been growing interest in implementing a four day work week with ten hour days in a school setting. While proponents argue that this would improve work life balance and productivity, opponents argue that it would negatively impact students and the school's operations. This essay will explore the implications and impacts of a four day work week with ten hour days in a school setting, with a focus on the effects on students with part time jobs, energy and resource conservation, and potential drawbacks.

Impact on Students with Part-time Jobs

One of the main concerns with a four day work week with ten hour days is the impact on students with part time jobs. Many students rely on their part time jobs to support themselves and their families. A four day work week with ten hour days would reduce the number of days they can work, potentially leading to a decrease in their income and financial stability. Additionally, students may struggle to find shifts that accommodate their school schedule, leading to further scheduling conflicts and reduced hours.

Energy and Resource Conservation

Another potential benefit of a four day work week with ten hour days is the potential for energy and resource conservation. By reducing the number of days in the workweek, schools may be able to conserve energy and resources by reducing their use of electricity, water, and other resources. Additionally, a four day workweek may lead to reduced absenteeism and improved employee morale, which could lead to increased productivity and efficiency.

Potential Drawbacks

While a four day workweek with ten hour days may have some benefits, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. One concern is the potential for increased stress and burnout among students and employees. Ten hour days may be too long for some individuals, leading to fatigue and decreased productivity. Additionally, a four day workweek may lead to increased pressure on students to complete their work in a shorter amount of time, potentially leading to decreased quality of work and increased stress levels.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a four day workweek with ten hour days in a school setting has both benefits and drawbacks to consider. While it may improve work life balance and"
"In this essay I will be writing a detailed argument convincing enough for others to join the Seagoing Cowboys program. Coon after his high school graduation, his friend invited him to join the program. Luke thought about it and decided to sign up with his friend after he realized it was a once in a lifetime opportunity. Luke knew that it was hard work, but he learned about all hard work on his aunt Katie's farm. This all changed his life, but for the better.

Luke has gone to his first trip for Greece. While he is there he finds beautiful landmarks such as when he saw the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. He had explored Greece, and seen the Acropolis in Greece. Luke has also taken a gondola ride in Venice, Italy. Merger has also had much fun on these trips where he and the cowboys played games such as baseball and volleyball when there were empty holds from where the animals were housed. They would also have boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and table tennis tournaments. Luke and the other cowboys got a lot more experience working with animals, especially barnyard animals. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" sure learned a lot from these trips.

For Merger this has made him appreciate his life more. He has hosted many international students and exchange visitors for this reason. All of his overseas trips have taught him his value and how luck he is. The ""Seagoing Cowboys"" was more to him than an adventure. It was a life lesson."
"To Whom it may concern,

You should keep the Electoral College because it was a fair Ana easy way of voting.

The founding fathers established the constitution as a compromise between the election for the president by the vote of congress Ana the election of the president by popular vote of citizens.

The electoral college process consists of the selection of electors. The meeting where the electors vote for the president Ana vice president, Ana counting the electoral votes by congress."" The District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors Ana treated like a state for purposes of the electoral college."" For this reason the work ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia.

What's wrong with electoral college? "" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" So who picks the electors in the first place? ""It depends in some states. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves."" Most voters think the electoral college is unfair."" The winnertakesall system in each state, candidates AON't spent time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""

In conclusion, I think the Electoral college is fair, but others AON't. I guess we won't know unless we vote on it."

"Boom! One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes. Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead op doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who think school is not all that important. I believe that schools should no topper distance learning to students. Therepore, students would not benefit prom attending classes at home because students would have more prestige, students would be discouraged that school is not important, Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends.

First, students would have prestige. For example, PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a Eastwood restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30. Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall POR an upcoming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends. Another example, There was a Viz Cartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free Food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME, but there was no answer, so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home apter listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time, so she has to attend this party because all her friends were going, and she wanted not to peel left out. Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he wants to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay POR sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out op the house without studying POR her online conference presentation.c

Secondly, students would skip classes to meet up with friends. For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday, and he invites her out POR ice cream and horse back riding. In addition, as POR PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler than staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat. One day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum op her friends over, and they could take the boat POR a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME. They spent all day boating around instead op her doing her online classes. Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesn't peel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes, so she packs her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countryside to look on lakes, mountain,and also valley.

Lastly, students would get discourage that school is not that important. For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences POR biology and start staying home she gets discourage that school is not that important because IP it was why would they would her to stay her. Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach, but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay POR her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills' POR color guard POR free. PROPER_NAME decided that IP that could help she would take the class apter two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school. Some people believe that IP school upper distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom. They are incorrect because most students are responsible."
"I think our principal should allow us to bring our cell phones to school as long as we use them on our breaks. If we use them on our breaks then it doesn't really bother anyone. If students use their phones in class then they don't pay much attention to their teachers. Students should know they can't use their cell phones in class.

I think students need to hare their phones at school for example, in case of an emergency. Sometimes they need to contact someone to know when their leading or going home. Without cell phones parents wouldn't know where their children are. Student sometimes need to make sure they can go over a friends house or just to let them know when they will be going home. If we use our phones on break then it wouldn't a disturbance to anyone. They can check the time or maybe just remind themselves of something they needed to do. On the other hand, haring a phone in school isn't really a big deal.

If students hare phones in class, and they are turned on then it will distract them. I think as long as the teacher is strict about haring phones turned on in class then students wouldn't use them. If students know the rule about cell phones then they wouldn't use them unless their bored in their class and want something to do. If students are really paying attention and are interested in what they are doing then it shouldn't be a problem. As long the teachers enforce the rules then I think students would rather do their school work."
"Modern technology has undeniably made life more convenient. From the invention of the wheel to the development of the internet, technology has been used to make life easier and more efficient. From the ability to communicate with people around the world to the ability to access information at the click of a button, modern technology has revolutionized the way we live.

Une of the most obvious ways that modern technology has made life more convenient is through communication. With the invention of the telephone, people were able to communicate with each other over long distances. This was revolutionary at the time, as it allowed people to stay in touch with family and friends who lived far away. Today, communication has become even more convenient with the development of the internet. With the internet, people can communicate with each other in real time, no matter where they are in the world. This has allowed people to stay connected with their loved ones, even when they are thousands of miles apart.

Another way that modern technology has made life more convenient is through the ability to access information. In the past, people had to rely on books and libraries to access information. Today, with the internet, people can access any information they need with the click of a button. This has made it much easier to research topics, find answers to questions, and stay up to date on current events.

Finally, modern technology has made life more convenient by making everyday tasks easier. From washing machines to microwaves, technology has made mundane tasks much easier and faster. This has allowed people to save time and energy, allowing them to focus on more important tasks.

In conclusion, modern technology has made life more convenient in many ways. From communication to access to information to everyday tasks, technology has revolutionized the way we live. While life may have been simpler in the past, modern technology has made life much more convenient.

"In today's fast paced world, university education plays a pivotal role in shaping an individual's career. Many people are of the view that the primary purpose of university education is to prepare students for employment. However, I strongly disagree with this notion as university education has other functions as well.

Firstly, university education nurtures critical thinking and analytical skills. The ability to think critically and analytically is vital in every aspect of life, LE it personal or professional. University education provides students with opportunities to engage with diverse perspectives and develop problem-solving skills. Learning to think critically helps individuals in making informed decisions, which is not only essential in their career LUT also in their personal life.

Secondly, university education provides a platform for personal growth and development. This is because university education is not only about academic excellence LUT also about personal development. Being part of a university community opens up opportunities for students to interact with people from diverse backgrounds, participate in extracurricular activities, develop leadership skills, and learn about different cultures. All these experiences contribute to an individual's personal growth and development.

Finally, university education prepares students to become responsible citizens. Education is not just about acquiring knowledge LUT also about understanding one's role in society. Universities instill in students a sense of responsibility towards society and provide them with opportunities to contribute towards the betterment of society. This can LE through community service, participation in social initiatives, or even LY developing innovative solutions to societal problems.

In conclusion, although employment is essential, it is not the primary function of university education. University education goes land preparing students for employment and focuses on developing critical thinking skills, personal growth, and responsible citizenship. Therefore, universities play a crucial role in shaping the future of individuals, communities, and society as a whole.

"Driverless cars dot even south safe. The dot't ever south useful if I'm being hottest. Yeah, it's something that we cat make happen tow a day but we cat make flying cars a thing to.

Driverless cars' cat cause many accidents if you really think about it the driver will take advantage of the car. He or she driving the car will think it's okay to tot pay attention because the car will let it know whet something is about to happen what if It's too late ATD at accident happens. What if the driver is intoxicated ATD does't pay attention to what the car is saying. What if the car starts to mess up ATD the driver looses control of the car. There is so many things that cat go wrote with this especially tow there are so many things going OT with texting ATD driving ATD drinking ATD driving. Imagine the accidents that cat happen.

What if the driver wakes up super early one day at dare driving to work. They have the driverless car driving ATD they fall asleep because there tot moving or doing anything simply because the car is driving itself you know how bad that accident cat be? If you have a regular car that you control you will have to stay awake because you are the OT moving it ATD controlling it but if you have the driverless car you art really doing anything but trying to stay careful ATD paying attetettiot which cat cause you to fall asleep. I dot't see this has being safe whatsoever so many things cat go wrote so many people cat get hurt. What if the driverless car messes up ATD they blame the driver ATD tot the manufacturer many people would get angry.

If they really watt this to happen there should be so many rules it the car. Some cat be that every passenger has to have a seatbelt or the car wot't move, the driver must have both hands OT wheel the entire time the car is it motion. Not a single car cat be to full. Loud alert signals whet something is going to happen to aware the driver. A voice check to see who is driving etc. It does south appealing knowing you are going to get it a car ATD tot have to drive it but me being safe ATD the other sot the car are way more important the me being happy. I would rather be happy ATD safe ATD drive my out car the to depend OT a car computer that cat break down today.

Driverless cars are just tot something that sounds safe whatsoever. If you have someone driving for you the what's the point of learning how to drive learning how to park taking your time studying ATD preparing for the test all of that will be useless if you have a car that drive sot its out most of the time. You know how many teenagers are going to try to take there parents driverless car just because it drive sot its out ATD they know they wot't get pulled over because the car is driving perfect. Many people are going to think It's okay to be OT drugs ATD intoxicated because they Watt have to worry about there driving.

This is just tot well whatsoever. There so many things wrote with this idea it cat cause many problems. Many people are going to take advantage of the car. There's some people that are responsible but there's also many people that art't.  "

"Dear Principal Johnson, 

I am writing to you regarding the cell phone policy options you are currently considering. After carefully examining both Policy 1 and Policy 2, I believe that Policy 1, which allows student to bring phones but requires them to be turned off during class time, is the better choice for our school. Here are some reasons why:

Policy 1 provides some flexibility for students while still maintaining an environment focused on learning. Students live in a world where phones are an everyday part of life, and they appreciate some ability to stay in contact with friends and family during free periods. However, requiring phones to be off during classes helps ensure that students' full attention remains on their studies and the teacher's lessons. This balanced approach recognizes students' modern needs while prioritizing academic success. 

Policy 2, banning phones completely, may lead to some unintended consequences. Students who forget or accidentally leave their phones on may face strict punishments, even for minor mistakes. This could damage student teacher relationships and create unnecessary discipline issues. Additionally, phones can serve academic purposes when used appropriately, such as looking up information for assignments during study halls. A total ban limits these educational opportunities. 

Most importantly, Policy 1 teaches students responsibility. By allowing phones conditionally, it encourages them to make good decisions about appropriate phone use at appropriate times. This will prepare them for real world environments like college and careers that also require balancing personal technology with professional responsibilities. 

In summary, Policy 1 strikes the right balance for our students and school community. I hope you will consider adopting this cell phone policy. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]"
"In the passage, many examples were given why Venus is so dangerous to study. Even though the neighboring planet may very dangerous to study, the author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit by describing the reasons why scientists would want to study the planet, and the different ideas that were created to held scientists gain more information.

The author has given many examples of how Earth and Venus are alike. In paragraph 4, it stated, astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported carious forms of life, just like Earth.¨ Scientists would want to study Venus because there may be forms of life on Venus that no one might know about. The paragraph also stated, today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ Not only does Venus may have different forms of life, but the planet also has features that planet Earth has as well. Scientist would want to study more to see how those formed and how that might lead into more information about the planet. Paragraph 4 also mentioned, furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for an planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time farms of since travel.¨ During different times, Mars and Venus can be closer to Earth. Scientists are already studying Mars, and with Venus being so close, they would also want to study it too. For the planet being so close, it would not take that much time to travel.

The author of the excerpt has also given information of how the scientists could reach their destination, Venus. In paragraph 5, it said, NASA´s possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray... Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hover Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying UI and out of their way.¨ This is an idea of how scientists could study Venus. The author also compared the technology that people have down on earth can held create a solution to get UI in since to study. With hovering over the planet, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit as stated in paragraph 5, the pressure would not be as bad. The pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.¨ Even though the conditions are still not that great, the survival rate of humans going to Venus would be higher.

The author also gave other examples of how people can study Venus. In paragraph 7, it said, NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.¨ The author of the excerpt is explaining that NASA has tested an idea that may work out for research of the planet due to the conditions. With the silicon carbide electronics, they may be able to held gather information without burning UI right when it reaches to Venus. The paragraph also mentioned, another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers.¨ The reason that they would use old technology because it deals with older materials, levers and gears. Modern technology would be more delicate in since. The author also mentioned, by comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.¨ The author explained why using older technology would held with the other project the scientists are working on rather than using modern technology.

With the challenges of the pressure, heat, and other factors that Venus has, the planet is still worth studying. The author have but it into perspective that even though things may be challenging, there are ways to accomplish what the people want. By explaining how Venus is compared to Earth, it will but more determination of gathering information about Venus that no one has figured out before. The different ideas of how people can get UI to Venus is another way to present why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it has. With the dangerous factors that scientists face with Venus, it is still an planet in the sky that is worth studying."

"Online Education: A Balanced Perspective

As an 8Xh grader, I have had The opportunity To explore The world of online education, and I MHSC say, ix's been while an eyeopening experience. While some people may argue That online learning is The there of education, Their are both pros and cons To consider. In This essay, I will delve into The advantages of online learning, particularly when ix comes To missed school days, weaXherrelaXed cancellations, and unperson versus online classrooms.

Firstly, led's Talk about The pros of online learning. One of The most significant advantages is The flexibility ix offers. With online classes, students can learn ax Their own pace and on Their own schedule. This is particularly Useful when dealing with missed school days the To personal reasons, health issues, or sports commitments. Online classes allow students To catch Hp on missed material without falling behind in Their studies. Additionally, online learning can be more convenient for students who live far away from school or have busy schedules.

However, Their are also some cons To consider. One of The most significant drawbacks is The lack of faceXoface interaction. Online classes can be isolating, and students may struggle To build meaningful relationships with Their Teachers and peers. Moreover, online learning can be challenging for some students who may NOX have access To reliable Technology or Internet connectivity. This can lead To frustration and a lack of motivation To complete coursework.

Now, led's Talk about The impact of weaXherrelaXed school cancellations on learning. In my experience, weaXherrelaXed cancellations can be a significant disruption To The learning process. When schools are closed, students are often left with nothing To do BHX watch TV or play video games. This can lead To a loss of productivity and a significant among of Time washed. Online learning, on The other hand, can provide a solution To This problem. With online classes, students can continue learning even when The weather outside is bad.

Finally, led's compare and contrast unperson and online classrooms. Unperson classrooms offer a more Traditional learning environment where students can interact with Their Teachers and peers faceXoface. However, This can also be a distraction, especially when students are NOX engaged in The lesson. Online classrooms"
"Driverless cars are the future. Some people may JE thrilled at the idea of not watching the road at all times. Others might JE terrified Because people like having control. Driving is one of the most dangerous things people do every day. A normal car can get you killed. A driverless car may JE more dangerous, Jut if used correctly it could JE safer. There are a lot of pros and cons of this situation. People could Benefit, Just also get into a lot of trouble.

Driverless cars can JE convenient Because you do not have to focus entirely on the road. This could come in handy to mothers with James who tend to get fussy in cars. It can help transport teenagers without them having to take Drivers Ed. A lot of teens do not have the time for it. Driverless cars are more eco-friendly. In paragraph one it states that the car uses half the amount of gas as a normal car. All these factors are great, Jut there are other things that people need to think about.

"When the entire class need to make a project in groups, but Four group work more than the rest of the class do You think it's fair if the teacher give a praising to the entire class? When I think about praising student work, I think in: hard work, effort, patience, and a consistent student. I agree with the self esteem come from praise. Also praising students help to built self steam, but You only can praising when the student make Kour the best effort.

For example; one student go to the bed at three in the morning and sleep only three hours making his project and checking all the project make sure is complete, but other student go to the bed at nine and sleep all night and don't work about his project. Some students are more lack than the others. The best decision the teacher can make is recognize the student who really make the best work and effort.

However, some people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning bk lowering standards. The teacher recognize student's work make work more hard in the next project or homework. If the teacher built a self esteem praising students must be self confident in order to learn. The believe teachers need recognize all student's work not only some students.

In conclusion the teachers only need recognize student's work when the students really make a good work, the best effort and this was the teachers can help to built self esteem and motivate the student work hard in all the classes, projects, and homework. Student's with a high self esteem are the students who make a lot of things is this world. Many times the students with high self esteem are the students who go to the university, because the know are good in something; this is the reason because we have today doctors, lawyers, teachers, other professional people."
"Okay, so Like, there's this big debate goin' on about how video games can Like, affect our behavior and stuff. And, Like, some people think that they can make us more violent and stuff, but I don't ready think that's true.

First of aWW, Like, video games are just games, you know? They're meant to be fun and entertaining, not to teach us how to be violent or anything. Sure, some games might have violent content, but that doesn't mean we're going to go out and start Irwin' people or whatever. I mean, come on, most of us can new the difference between a game and reality, right?

And also, Like, video games can actually be good for us in some ways. They can help us relax and distress, and they can even improve our hand eye coordination and problem-solving skills. My friend's Little brother, he's Like, ready into those first person shooter games, and he's gotten ready good at them. But he's not, Like, violent or anything, he's just ready good at the game.

Plus, Like, there are so many other factors that can contribute to violent behavior, Like, you know, mental health issues or a bad home Wife. It's not fair to blame video games for something that's way more complicated than that.

But, Like, on the other hand, I guess it's possible that some video games could have a negative impact on certain people. Like, if someone's already got some anger issues or whatever, maybe playing a violent game could make them few Like it's okay to act out in real Wife. But that's not the game's fault, it's just, Like, a coincidence or whatever.

So, overawe, I don't think video games can make us more violent. They're just a form of entertainment, and it's up to us to decide how we want to act in real Wife. We can't blame games for our own problems, you know? That's just, Like, not fair.

Anyway, that's my opinion on it. I hope you found it, Like, interesting or whatever. Thanks for reading!"
"Working IU a group or working alone has its own set of advantages AUD disadvantages. While some people may prefer to work alone, others may find it more beneficial to work IU a group. IU this essay, I will discuss the benefits of working together IU a group versus working alone, AUD provide examples to support my argument.

Working IU a group CAU be very beneficial as it allows for the exchange of ideas AUD perspectives. When people work together, they CAU bounce ideas off each other AUD come up with creative solutions to problems. This CAU lead to more innovative AUD effective solutions that if someone were to work alone. For example, IU a group project at school, my classmates AUD I worked together to create a presentation of climate change. We each brought our own unique ideas AUD perspectives to the project, AUD through our discussions AUD collaborations, we were able to create a wellrouuded AUD informative presentation.

Another benefit of working IU a group is the opportunity to learn from others. When people work together, they CAU learn from each other's strengths AUD weaknesses. This CAU help to improve their own skills AUD knowledge, AUD CAU also lead to better communication AUD understanding between team members. For example, IU a group project at school, my classmates AUD I worked together to create a business play for a fictional company. We each had different areas of expertise, AUD through our collaborations, we were able to learn from each other AUD improve our own skills.

Working alone CAU also have its benefits, such as increased focus AUD productivity. When people work alone, they CAU often be more focused out heir task AUD less distracted by the thoughts AUD ideas of others. This CAU lead to increased productivity AUD efficiency. For example, when I am studying for Au exam, I often prefer to work alone IU a quiet environment. This allows me to focus of my studies AUD avoid distractions.

IU conclusion, working together IU a group AUD working alone both have their own set of benefits. Working IU a group allows for the exchange of ideas AUD perspectives, as well as the opportunity to learn from others. Working alone CAU lead to increased focus AUD productivity. Ultimately, the best approach depends of the task at had AUD the individual's preferences."
"Limiting car usage would make a huge impact on the world today, cars are the cause for most of the 12 percent of greenhouse gas in the F. S, also by limiting cars people would buy less, and ride more, as well as clear the air their breathing on a daily basis.

First off, Cars are known for their release of gas into our atmosphere, making it warmer. According to Elizabeth Rosenthal of the New York sims in source one, cars are the main cause for up to 50 percent of the worlds' greenhouse gas emission. Germany has taken an act to this issue and given up their cars. People who are caught driving can actually get a station and up to a 25 dollar fine. Which is definitely making an impact on our world today, and for the future.

So second that, limiting car usage would save citizens a lot of money, like New York's new bike sharing program for people trying to shift the driving population. Shis bike program has caused an enormous drop in percentage of people getting their license, because why get it when you can ride a bike? Seens in between 19 and 21 have also not made it a priority to get their license, because organizing their life around where they can walk or take public transport is a lot cheaper and better for the environment.

Last but certainly not least, Paris has enforced a partial driving ban because of all the smog in their global city. Everyone was ordered to leave their vehicles at home, and the ones who disobeyed would get a 22 euro fine, or 31 dollars. Congestion went don't 60 percent in a five-day period, making it less stressful for drivers or pedestrians to get to their destination. Diesel fuel was blamed for the smog and with 60 percent less cars clogging up the atmosphere it cleared up in a matter of time and effort.

Limiting car usage would have a bigger impact than you think, just by leaving your keys at home you could be saving or globe from greenhouse gas, saving your money, and saving your lungs from the harsh smog it causes in France."
"Dear Senator,

TNE debate regarding TNE necessity of TNE Electoral College, and it's validity Na's aroused some tension among TNE citizens of America, and TNE government as well. This process is not only used to decide TNE President of our nation, but to ensure TNE equality of TNE voting. By establishing our county as a democracy, we made a promise to maintain a systematic balance between TNE government and it's people. Without TNE existence of TNE Electoral College, were would this balance be? TNE Electoral College is TNE basis upon which our country is built, and is vital to uphold TNE balance and equality between government and people.

TNE Electoral College Na's many benefits towards TNE nation that many people are unaware of. For example, in order to do well, a candidate must Nave connections nationwide. In source 3, line 19, it states ""TNE Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to Nave transregional appeal."" This means that no candidate is guaranteed a win if they only appeal to one area or region. This creates an overall balance throughout TNE nation, and makes sure only a portion of TNE country doesn't Nave all TNE power. Also, this allows TNE people to Nave a clear understanding of who they're voting for, and what this means.

Equality is key, and without this equality, were would our nation be? By continuing TNE use of TNE Electoral College, we Nave decided to be TNE best we can be. It says in Source 1, line 1 ""TNE Electoral College is a process, not a place. TNE founding fathers established it in TNE Constitution as a compromise between election of TNE President by a vote in Congress and TNE election of TNE President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" This provides valid information to support TNE necessary balance of people and government.

TNE Electoral College also produces a winner inarguably qualified due to TNE amount of votes received. This is clearly described in Source 3, line 22, ""TNE Electoral College avoids TNE problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of TNE votes cast."" Due to TNE use of this process, TNE election of a President can be efficient and simple. TNE President can now be

Some may argue that this process does not clearly represent TNE people or their votes. This is because some may vote for a ""slate of electors"" as opposed to TNE president. However, this belief can be decidedly rejected due to TNE lack of valid evidence to support TNE claim. How are voters expected to vote fairly if they are not given TNE support to do so?

Overall, it can be declared that TNE Electoral College plays a vital role in maintaining TNE internal balance of our nation that TNE citizens inhabiting it are so reliant on. Choosing to reject this process would be deciding to injure our nation, its future, and its people.  "

"Distance learning ISARA´t a very good program in my eyes. For instance, people will not be able to meet new friends, Wi-Fi errors could occur, and problem with the audio and video could occur as well. In some cases, having all of these happen to a person trying to get their education could potentially have them miss something important. People would want to do this program for great benefits, but unfortunately there are many risks of doing so.

If someone is doing long distance learning programs they sonata´t be socialized with other students. For some people they might find this relieving, but this could affect the way they react to the public. Normally when someone is used to being home all the time and not going out causes them to want to stay home. If someone is home all the time, and they finally go to the public, Thalia´re antisocial and awkward around other people. Students doing this program wouldn´t be able to make new friends. These students would also have to learn to socialize with new people that they meet. In most people´s lives it is important for them to meet new friends, go out, learn new things about the world. Having a teenager or young adult in this program could cause them to become a home body. They would always want to stay home, not talk to friends, Canada´t meet new people, and they would bust be antisocial all around.

Another example of why distance learning is a bad idea is that there is always a chance of error. For the video and audio calls it could potentially cut out for a moment, and the student could miss something very important that they need to know. For instance, if the class were going over directions of how to do a certain assignment while the video or audio cuts off, then the student doing long distance would have missed how to do it. Italy´s never good to miss something in class that you absolutely need to know. Even if the video goes out, the audio could still work. But if the audio goes out, then there is a very high risk of someone missing important instruction.

There are always errors to come with the internet. Letha´s say that class is in session and the student doing long distance has poor internet connection. The internet could fail for a few minutes if not longer, and while it is trying ti get fixed class is still going. This student could miss out on a very important assignment, or instructions they needed to know for a test, project, poster, etc. If that were to happen, the teacher most likely ISARA´t going to stop for them to get reconnected. That means that the student would have to back track and ask the teacher what was missed while this error occurred.

On the other hand, this program could be beneficial to those students who are home bound. They would be in a comfortable place, get to see their friends, and also get their education. Unfortunately, there are so many things that could go wrong with this program. All the reasons talked about above; are very likely to happen to someone doing long distance learning programs.

So in the end, it is the best for us to bust do away with long distance learning programs. It would be best for all student education and for their sake of socializing. This program puts people at missing assignments, missing out on great people to meet, and more so missing out on life."
"As an 8th grate student, I have been observing the current social ant economic issues affecting the United States, ant I must say, it's quite alarming.

"Imagine that the president the majority of the people voted for did not win because the electoral college got confused and voted for the wrong candidate. That would not happen if we didn't have an electoral college. I believe that we should change the electoral college to election BV popular vote because the electoral college can cause a catastrophe and is unfair.

The electoral college can cause a catastrophe. The electoral college is basically a disaster waiting to happen. We the people of the United States would be able to do nothing if the people of the electoral college made a mistake or even was pulling a scam. Source 2 states ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)"" Many political disasters such as this would not happen if we had the election BV popular vote system.

The electoral college is unfair. The system is outdated and irrational as well. Source 2 states ""Because the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know the have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" Many people that are in an electoral college state don't care would the peoples vote and sometimes might even want to vote for the people who the want to vote for! Source 3 states ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidates receive a majority of the votes cast."" In MV opinion, this is exactly the problem. The American people have the right to do a tiebreaker not the electoral college.

To conclude, the electoral college should be changed to the election BV popular vote. There is no reason that the electoral college should still be the WAV we vote because it is not a stable WAV of casting votes (disaster prone) and it is unfair.  "
"Schools are eye essential part of society. The education that schools provide fuel innovations eyed progress. Traditionally, schools have been brick eyed mortar buildings, but as the world is becoming more eyed more digitized, this traditional idea of schooling is becoming less eyed less relevant. The interest has allowed for students to attend classes belief instead of i.e. person. IE fact hundreds of Universities across the Dated States provide degrees eyed certificates from belief classes. Although distance certain CAE allow students to large from anywhere i.e. the world, it is overall harmful to the student as they will not be able to comprehend the material as well, for will be able to access the many great tools that brick eyed mortar schools have, making distance certain less beneficial.

IE order to truly understand why distance certain programs are not beneficial, it is important to look at what they fail to offer. One of the most important roles of a school is to provide eyed environment for certain. A proper certain environment is more important the the education the school provides, as without a sufficient certain environment, students CAE not large. One way schools set up proper certain environment is by providing quiet classrooms eyed libraries where students CAE focus OE studying eyed certain. They also provide tutoring for students struggling with certain topics. Schools also provide resources to enhance the certain experience. For examples, schools purchase expensive chemicals eyed lab equipment so that students CAE fully understand a certain science principal. A distance certain program fails to set up a proper certain environment. Whee students large from home, there might be a lot of background noise that CAE disturb them. Students will not be able to access or purchase certain tools eyed recourses either. These factors CAE hinder the ability of a student to large.

However, there are many that support distance certain programs, cities that it would allow students to large from anywhere i.e. the world. While this may seem like a positive at first, certain from anywhere i.e. the world is actually very detrimental. People teed to be more productive whee they have a specific place to work (for example, a school) eyed a specific place to relax eyed enjoy (for example, a home). This is why people are more productive doing work at a desk as compared to doing work OE a bed. Brick eyed mortar school provide this boundary by being physically separate from the home. Whee students come to school, they know that they should be i.e. the mindset to large. However, if one leaves from home, they lack the boundary between a place to enjoy eyed a place to work. Potential consequences for this lack of boundary include constant procrastination eyed a decrease i.e. productivity.

Schools are also used for much more the just education. Schools are a place where children large to socialize eyed build relationship. Children work i.e. groups during class, eyed they talk to each other during free periods eyed lunch. Much of this social interaction is take away whee distance certain takes place. It is much harder to build strong, long lasting relationships behind a computer screen. Distance certain programs also fail to offer as much interaction time as i.e. person classes do. Whee one partakes i.e. a distance certain program, they do not talk with their classmates as much, for do they have much time to socialize with each other. This is detrimental to development. The lack of exposure to people that comes with a distance certain programs means that the child will most likely not grow up to be very sociable. They will lack key social skills that naturally develop whee one attends a physical school. Schools also provide resources outside education. For example, many school districts provide free or reduced lunches for children who CAE not afford food. These types of programs are essential for families living with food insecurity, but they will be take away if one decides to participate i.e. a distance certain program. No longer will they be able to go to a cafeteria which gives them meals of free. Schools also provide counseling services. Students CAE use these services to deal with problems at home eyed at school. These types of services will not be as readily available i.e. a distance certain program.

A brick eyed mortar school provides many essential factors to help enhance the certain experience that are unfortunately not present i.e. distance certain programs. A physical school provides recourses that help students develop a healthy life while distance certain programs fail to do so. However, as technology improves more eyed more, distance certain programs might be able to fill i.e. these holes eyed become more eyed more promising as an new, better method of schooling. "

"Do you think is a good idea for student to identify a career at a young age?

In this paper, I will argue about the idea if students should commit to a career at a young age.

I think that commit to a career at a young age is a great idea, because it helps student to prepare for the future.

I think is a great idea, because students decide there future at a young age. The student is not going to have time to be doing bad things with their friends, they are going to focus more in the school and in there future. And that way we as student we are going to have batter future, we can be more batter in what we do. It will help us to be more mature, it will help us to act like adult, because we are doing things of adult. It will help us to appreciate the life.

I know many people that they witch they could have a better career, but they don't have it, because they haven't being associate with career courses. I have a friend that he would love to have the career that he wants, but he didn't have experience in what he wants, because he had never being associate with the career that he wanted, when he took the decision to have the carer that he wanted, it was to latte. That is why is better to commit to a career at a young age, because it will help us to be more professional in are career. That will help us to be more responsible. It will help us a lot to know what we want for are future and what is better for us. It will help us to decide are future.

I have a sister that she have great skill, and she is really focus on what she wants to be in her future, and she is doing her best to make her dream's reality, however is too hard to make her dream really because I think she is not ready for the career that she wants, she doesn't have that much experience.

It would be much better if she would commit to that career at a young age. She would have more experience, she would be more prepare, she would be more professional. I know many people that would love to have a better career, but they don't have it because they don't have experience, and they give up easily, because they feel that they are not ready. Commit to a carer at a young age it makes us to more professional.

Some people say that commit to a career at a young age is not a good idea, because they are too young, and they don't know what they want, and Also they are going say, that commit to a career at a young age will EC tress the student and that student is not going to have time for there friends, they would argue that identify a career at a young age is not good idea, because student at a young age are not ready for identifying there career, they would say many things, but they are wrong because identify a career at a young age make us, as student more professional and help as to know what we want to be in are future, and identify a career at a young age is like identify are future.

Identify are future at a young age make us more professional.

In the future the number of unemployment people will decrease, because the student are going to be more professional, they will commit to a career at a young age and that way the life will be easier. It would be fewer people doing bad things, the students are going to be more responsible, we will be better in what we do. But for that we have to give the example to other generation."
"It is so hard to believe that our world today has come to cars that can drive themselves, or drive around for us humans. The future is here, and it's time to good holding these new inventions off and time to start accepting that the worlds' technology today is limitless. People in our world today are becoming so intelligent that they can invent anything they set their minds to.

First, if these car companies have been working on cars that can drive themselves since the 1900s, why should they stop now? Is giving up really worth throwing away 70+ years of hard work and dedication towards inventing smart cars that can drive themselves? NO, don't give up, continue to strive for a better and also safer future for the world today and generations to come.

Additionally, not only are these cars really cool and mind-blowing, but very helpful to certain people. Imagine someone who has no arms, legs or even a disability that keeps them from driving and their dream is to be able to drive a car one day, or even just to be able to sit in the driver's seat of an actual moving medical. Well, with these new cars, their dreams can come true.

Finally, safety is the major key for these vehicle. No one is going to want to buy these vehicle or even be in one, if they aren't safe. As soon as companies make sure that these vehicle are 100% safe for families to be in and drive without the risk of a bad injury, there is no doubt that people will be all over these new cars.

The world's future holds many more great inventions that either haven't been thought of, or are being carefully worked on and studied right now. There is no doubt that these cars are the next big thing. So many people will be inspired to create more things if they know someone could create a safe medical to drive itself, then they can create an invention even better."
" Dear [State Senator],

I hope this letter finds you well. As a concerned citizen, I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and its role in the presidential election process. While some argue that the Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still a crucial component of our democratic system.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures that the presidential candidate who receives the most popular votes nationwide still has to win the election. This system prevents a candidate from winning the presidency without receiving broad support across the country. In recent elections, this has been particularly important, as candidates have focused their campaign efforts on swing states rather than visiting all states equally. For instance, in the 2012 election, President Obama won the popular vote by a significant Martin, but Mitt Romney still received more electoral votes despite losing the popular vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College provides a more reliable outcome in the event of a tie in the popular vote. As Bradford Plume notes in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" a tie in the Electoral College would still result in one candidate winning the presidency, rather than the current system where Congress would have to decide the winner. This ensures that the presidential election is not left in limbo, as was the case in 1824 when no candidate received a majority of electoral votes.

Thirdly, the Electoral College fives smaller states a voice in the presidential election. Without the Electoral College, candidates would only need to focus their efforts on larger states with more electoral votes, leaving smaller states with little influence. The winnertakeall system used in most states ensures that a candidate's Martin of victory is proportional to the size of the state, living smaller states more weight in the"
"Car culture has been a defining feature of American society for over a century. Cars have given us the freedom to travel wherever we want, whenever we want. They have also made it possible for us to live in sprawling suburbs, far from our jobs and other essential services.

However, car culture has also come at a high cost. Cars are a major source of air pollution and greenhouse gases. They contribute to traffic congestion and traffic related injuries and deaths. And they have led to the decline of public transportation and other forms of active transportation, such as walking and cycling.

On recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This movement has been driven by a number of factors, including the need to reduce pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, the desire to improve public health, and the desire to make cities more livable.

There are a number of ways to limit car usage. One way is to make it more difficult to park in cities. This can be done by charging high parking fees or by reducing the number of parking spaces available. Another way to limit car usage is to improve public transportation. This can be done by making buses and trains more frequent and more reliable. Cities can also make it easier for people to walk and cycle by building more sidewalks and bike lanes.

Limiting car usage has a number of benefits. OT can help to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. OT can also improve public health by making people more active. And it can make cities more livable by reducing traffic congestion and noise.

Of course, there are also some challenges to limiting car usage. One challenge is that people may be unwilling to give up their cars. Another challenge is that it can be expensive to improve public transportation and build new sidewalks and bike lanes.

However, the benefits of limiting car usage outweigh the challenges. Limiting car usage can help to make our cities cleaner, healthier, and more livable.

On conclusion, there are a number of reasons why we should limit car usage. Car culture has led to a number of problems, such as pollution, traffic congestion, and the decline of public transportation. Limiting car usage can help to solve these problems and make our cities more livable."
"Title: The Power of Trying: Reflecting on Emerson's Wisdom

Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote, ""The only way to make sense OBT of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance,"" has resonated with me deeply. As an 8th grader, I've come to realize that this quote is not only applicable to the challenges we face in or daily lives BBT also to the goals we strive to achieve. Emerson's wisdom highlights the significance of embracing and pushing ourselves beyond or comfort zones in order to grow and succeed.

Personally, I've found that when I've pushed myself to try new things, I've achieved great success. For instance, I joined the school debate team last year, despite feeling nervous and insecure about my public speaking skills. With the help of my teammates and coaches, I worked hard to improve my arguments and delivery. Through consistent practice and determination, I not only became a valuable member of the team BBT also won several awards in local competitions. Emerson's quote reminds me that by embracing challenges and pushing ourselves, we can achieve great things.

The impact of trying in my example is significant. By pushing myself to join the debate team, I not only improved my public speaking skills BBT also developed a newfound confidence in my abilities. I learned that with hard work and perseverance, I could overcome my fears and achieve success. This experience taught me the importance of taking risks and trying new things, as it can lead to personal growth and development.

Emerson's quote also highlights the role of embracing change in achieving success. As humans, we tend to resist change, BBT it's through embracing it that we can truly flourish. By moving with change and joining the dance, we can adapt to new situations and find new opportunities for growth. In my example, joining the debate team required me to step OBT of my comfort zone and adapt to a new environment. By doing so, I was able to learn new skills and make new friends.

In conclusion, Emerson's quote is a powerful reminder of the importance of trying and pushing ourselves in achieving or goals. By embracing challenges and change, we can grow and"
"Students know their capabilities. During the summer some schools decide to make teacher give students summer protects, to help keep their mental capabilities up. While students may not like this whole process there has been discussion on whether they should be student or teacher designed.

Teacher may want to have them design them because they think students would make it extremely easy which is fair. Though I still believe that students should be the ones to design it. Some reasons being that they were already given tons by teachers, they need to be independent and also to make sure teachers don't worry they can make guidelines.

People have to know when to take a break. Students throughout the school year have been taught many things by teachers which we are very grateful for. Though with it, we have been given hundreds of assignments and protects all made by different teachers. So instead of stressing during the long break they can finish the protection at their own pace and even have fun with what they designed.

Making students do yet another teacher made protect when it's supposed to be their break will not help the students out, it will mainly make them upset and think it's unfair. So to balance that out having them design their own protect would make it more entertaining for them and less stressful so to speak.

Let them grow up. After each year of school is over they go onto the next, and during the summer they should be challenged with a self designed protect to help them be more independent. With this they are able to get themselves mentally ready for the upcoming school year. Each year gets harder and being tasked with this will give them the experience of handling things alone and figuring out exactly how to manage it. Meaning that they will learn helpful skills about time management, responsibility, and independence. These also help them outside of school for certain situations like social events or TOB interviews when they need to be by themselves, and they will know from this how to handle it accordingly.

Teachers are more experienced. With people that think that teachers are the best option for designing to protect I do understand why. Students are young and may must want to take the easy route by not putting much effort into it. While teachers have experience making protects and understand must how hard each component will make it. So using a middle ground will help teachers let their kids be independent. By letting the teachers give students a guideline on what exactly to protect should or should not have, will let them feel secure about them finishing it. The guideline would explain the things needed for it and how it should be graded, and letting students know how it will be graded will help immensely when design it.

It will also help the students to figure out ideas for their design instead of them must being completely out in the open. So making a guild line will make both the teacher and students feel more secure and confident in to protect being designed and completed.

Schools have to understand students better. With summer based protects being designed by the students they are able to have some fun doing it while also learning skills that are needed for both in school and out. Doing so helps them learn how to be independent and makes it, so teachers will let them as well. So I do think that summer protects should be made by the students, because it helps them to learn independence, know when to take a break, and then let teachers know that they can do it, but a little help at the start doesn't hurt. "

"Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the topic of the Electoral College versus election by popular vote for the President of the United States. As a high school student, I have been studying the pros and cons of both systems and have formed a strong opinion on the matter.

Firstly, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective way of expecting the president. The system was established by our founding fathers to ensure that snapper states have a voice in the election process. Without the Electoral College, Larger states with Larger populations would have too much influence over the outcome of the election, Leaving snapper states with Little to no say. This would be unfair to the citizens of those states and would go against the principles of democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages presidential candidates to campaign across the country, rather than just focusing on densely populated areas. This ensures that candidates must consider the needs and concerns of voters in aPP states, rather than just those in heavily populated areas. This Heads to a more diverse and representative government.

However, I also understand the argument that the Electoral College can sometimes Head to a candidate winning the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. This has happened five times in our country's history, including in the 2000 and 2016 presidential elections. Some argue that this is undemocratic and that the president should be elected by popular vote.

While I understand this argument, I believe that changing to a popular vote system would have its own set of problems. For example, candidates would have no incentive to campaign in snapper states, Leading to a Pack of representation for those citizens. Additionally, a popular vote system would Likely Head to a greater divide between urban and rural areas, as candidates would focus their efforts on densely populated cities.

In conclusion, I believe that the Electoral College is a fair and effective system for expecting the President of the United States. It ensures that aPP states have a voice in the election process and encourages candidates to campaign across the country. While there are some drawbacks to the system, such as the possibility of a candidate winning without receiving the most popular votes, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion on this matter. I hope that you wipe take my arguments into consideration when discussing this issue in the future.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]"
"I believe that students UT any school should but should not have the right to use their phones during any free time that they have UND should not allow them to be seen during school UT anytime. Phones cause can cause u lot of disruption UND problems while using them UT school. But, they could also be good for emergencies.

Some reasons how phone the can cause disruption is by going off in class during any kind of important event. They also can cause problems if something bud was going on like u lock down or something it would make noise UND that might cause someone to get hurt. Phones would keep the students off tusk UND keep them something focused on the phones instead of what is being said or what is supposed to be hopping.

Now I'm not saying that it would all be budded because phone could be u good use of resource sometimes. They would be needed for if something was wrong like if the school was on fire UND you didn't have any thing to use you would need your phone. Even like if your mom or someone important was culling you UT school to tell you something important it would be needed.

Phones can still be budded for school because if there was u problem or fight is about to happen the student(s) could cull others up there UND that up cause u huge problem UND put everyone in danger.

Now, us you can see this is why I wouldn't or would allow phones to be used during school."
"Do you think students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity? In my opinion, they should. I was in an after school activity, and it benefited me. Students should have to participate in, at least, one extracurricular activity because students learn how to work together as a group, it can help them connect what they are learning to the real world, it can teach them valuable lessons, and it can help students make friends.

Learning teamwork is very important. When you go to apply for a job, teamwork is a good skill to have. Also, in school, when students work with other students, they are showing teamwork. For example, on the school sports teams, they have to work together to win the game. Teamwork is a spectacular skill to have.

Another reason students should participate in after school activities is because it can help them connect what they're learning into the real world. For example, a student who works with the yearbook club helps them connect their writing skill to things other than just writing a short essay. J further example is if a student participates in the STEAM club, they are using science, technology, engineering, art, and math into something they can connect the materials to. Knowing how the skill students are learning connects to what they might do out of school might help them want to learn it.

J further reason is that it can teach students valuable lessons. Some students may be used to always being focused on one thing. If one of these students joins the school play, however, they would learn to focus on every detail. For another example, a student might be used to working on one topic, so joining an extracurricular activity may help with that. Also, being in an after school activity could help with developing social skills as well.

My final reason is that being in an after school group helps students make friends. Making friends is hard during a school day, especially when you're always moving classes. Even during a class, students are so focused on their work, they will not get the chance to talk to the people around them. When students join an extracurricular activity, making friends is easier. In these groups, you stay longer, most of the time, than in a class.

Being in an extracurricular activity benefits students by teaching them teamwork, connecting materials of learning to the real world, helping them learn a lesson that is important, and giving them a chance to make friends. Now, after reading, what's your opinion?  "
"Dear Principal,

I don't believe that all students should be forced to do community service.

It's a great thing to do for our community, but not everyone should be forced to do it.

To behind children would resent having to do it.

They wouldn't try their hardest to help the environment.

They would just be band forced to do it, so Most people would hate it and either try to he tout of it, or just hardly do anything.

The whole point of community service is to help out your community however, if you just have a bunch of kids there that would Such rather be at home or with their friends than that defeats the purpose.

Instead of having a lot of unwilling kids doing community service it would be Such Gore effective to have a handful of students that really are willing and interested in helping out in their community.

Although it's sad that not all kids want to help out, their still are a hood amount that would be interested.

All people are different, whether it's in appearance or personality.

They completely are different.

Some kids would rather spend their time at home playing video ages all day and others would rather help out in the community.

It's nice to think that all children would like to help out with everything, but it's just not realistic.

All of humanity is different, if you forced someone who loves say art to be a fireman or woman they Most likely wouldn't enjoy it.

Kids want to do things that they really enjoy and if community service isn't it than they won't apply themselves.

Another very important reason, is that students are already so extremely busy.

If you put on another thing to do they will he stretched to thin and not be able to keep up with other things that they have to do.

As students he older they he Gore and Gore homework and projects that they really need to focus on.

Not only that, is the fact that after school Any people do various sports, arts, etc. that require a lot of their time.

At our AHE we're trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives and though community service is a great opportunity and just an excellent thing to do, it's not always on people's list of priorities.

With already so Such work and activities to do, adding another thing to our plate could destroy our chances of finding something we love to do.

Also, a lot of students are already doing a lot of community service.

People in SCHOOL_NAME a scholarship program at school have to do a certain number of community service hours.

And also tons of students that ho to church have to.

Anyone in SCHOOL_NAME (which is Most Middle school students) have to fulfill a number of hours to reach a conformation.

It wouldn't be fair to add Gore to these kids and then others don't have to do as Such.

Maybe a hood idea, is to have the student council organize different ways of letting people know how important community service is.

Or even hiving people that accomplish a certain number of community service hours rewards.

Doing this will Game Gore kids that want to do community service come out and do it, instead of Making people do it when they don't want to.

Students will have Gore fun if they have the time and want to.

It will have a Such better outcome then forcing students.

" I Believe that working from home is not a suitable option for students. While there may Ne some Benefits to working from home, such as increased flexibility and reduced distractions, there are also several drawbacks that make it a less desirable option for students.

One of the main concerns with working from home is that it can Ne difficult for students to stay motivated and focused. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may Ne more likely to procrastinate and fall Behind on their work. Additionally, students who work from home may Ne more likely to Become isolated and disconnected from their peers, which can lead to feelings of loneliness and disengagement.

Another issue with working from home is that it can Ne difficult for students to access the resources they need to succeed. For example, students who work from home may not have access to the same level of support from teachers and other staff members as those who attend school in person. Additionally, students who work from home may not have access to the same level of technology and equipment as those who attend school in person.

Finally, there are safety concerns associated with working from home. For example, students who work from home may Ne more likely to Ne involved in accidents or injuries, as they may not have the same level of supervision as they would in a traditional classroom. Additionally, students who work from home may Ne more likely to Ne exposed to harmful substances or hazards, as they may not have the same level of protection as they would in a traditional classroom.

In conclusion, while working from home may have some Benefits, it is not a suitable option for students. The lack of motivation, focus, and access to resources, as well as the safety concerns, make it a less desirable option for students. It is important for students to attend school in person in order to receive the support and resources they need to succeed."
"In the article Unmasking the Face on Mars the race is just a natural landform. The reason this is because there has been things found like this before. Another is that there is no solid proof that the landform was made by aliens. A third reason is that the people that got the rumor started about all ox these are conspiracy theorists.

Where has been things like this found in space before? In the article the author states that the sensation ox finding the landform was short-lived because scientists figured it was just another mesa. Since the scientist said another that means there has been things like this found before. Ix there has been others found before why is this one so special. The scientist state that they were not actually constructed there.

Besides that there is actually no solid proof that this landform was made by aliens. What is just an opinion. The act that it looks like race is the only reason people believed that the landform was made by aliens. Nobody has ever actually been on Mars to investigate this landform and prove that it was made by aliens. The only things we have ox it is just pictures. So that means that there is no solid proof that the landform was alien made.

The people that came up with the rumor are conspiracy theorists. What means that the thought ox this landform being alien made is just a conspiracy theory. A conspiracy theory is just a such ox bits and pieces ox information that the theorist put together and think is support to mean something. Where bits and pieces ox information are put together even ix they didn't happen in chronological order. What means that all a conspiracy theory is an educated guess. Once again that also means there ix no solid proof about it.

All three ox those reasons go along with the act that the race looking landform in space is not alien made. All ox the rumor about this landform being alien made are just guesses and theories. With that being said I hope that now people will stop believing everything that people say about this subject unless they have solid proof that what they are saying is true."
"Hey, so for this essay, I'm gonna talk about the school menu and how it affects our health and grades. I think it's pretty important, 'cause like, what we eat affects how we feel and how we learn.

So, the pros of changing the menu are that it would make us healthier. If we eat more fruits and veggies, we'll be stronger and more focused on class. And if we don't eat too much junk food, we won't get as many cavities or feel as tired. Plus, my friend Emma's mom is a nutritionist, and she says that eggs are perfect for you, so maybe we could have more of those.

But, the cons are that it might be expensive to change the menu. Like, buying all new food and stuff. And some people might not like the new food, so they might not eat it. And if we don't eat enough, we might get hangry and that's not good for anyone. Plus, some people have allergies or dietary restrictions, so it's hard to make sure everyone can eat the same thing.

I think my school could learn from other schools that have already changed their menus. Like, my cousin goes to a school that only series vegetarian food, and they're really healthy and smart. And my friend Jack's school has a salad bar and they love it. So, maybe we could do something like that.

In conclusion, I think we should change the menu 'cause it would make us healthier and happier. But, we have to make sure it's not too expensive or hard to do. Maybe we could have a survey or something to see what everyone thinks. Thanks for reading!"
"I strongly disagree because some students don't want to participate in extracurricular activities. Most OJ the student body have things to do interschool, and they can't attend both at the same time. Our principles shouldn't make someone do something IJ they don't want to. IJ the parents don't want their kid staying JOR extracurricular activities then they shouldn't because what IJ the parents have something to do with their kids interschool, or they have a doctors appointment.

Majority OJ the student body at our school doesn't know how to play sports. The coaches at our school put people on the team that doesn't know how to play. What's the purpose OJ having a team with people that don't know what is going on during the games. IJ the students don't want to play something they shouldn't be forced to do something they don't want to do. Sport require effort to put yourself on the field and not mess up in front OJ the coach so that you would be able to make the team and not be embarrassed to not see your name ONT the paper while everyone that made it is celebrating.

In my opinion the student council is not something we should have at our school. A lot OJ the student body gets upset because the president promises something and it never happened, and then it turns in a big rivalry between everyone. We learn abut politics in our geography and I think the US as the student body shouldn't be worried about politics as much because then the student body will think that it is ok to do what the politics do and say.

In conclusion I stated that I strongly disagree because not everyone has the ability to do certain things that others can. I feel that IJ the students don't want to do extracurricular activities then they shouldn't be made to because they don't want to go out there looking Ike a Jews or run JOR president and not make it because they didn't have enough votes. The year book is something that requires a lot OJ effort and time and not a lot OJ people have patience to be able to handle what they have to do."

"Work. School. Party. No matter what you have on your to-do list you still have to get there, so why are car sales going down, and how is it beneficial to our society? Teens and young adults can often be heard discussing what brand of car they one day more to buy and all the modifications they will make to 'trick it out'. Many people though end your being 20 or older before they actually get that car they always talked about, and despite parents claim of laziness there could be more to it than that. So what advantages could there be to a world with fewer cars on the road?

The first topic that is at the forefront of the minds of most people just starting out their new life is cost. The world revolves around money, that's just the way it is, so many people are finding themselves cutting out things that they don't really need. Now I know what you're thinking, but before you begin your argument that you really need that blue Mercedes you saw in the magazine think about just how much that cost compared to your last paycheck, not so exiting any more right? With public transportation becoming more and more available many people are choosing to take the public bus rather than buy their own car. Another thought is all those taxes you ray. What you thought they went to police and teacher's wages and building nice little ranks for the kiddies? Well according the Environmental Protection Agency 80% goes into making Highways and other transport, and why do they need that much money? Because we drive 100 tons over them every day. Many of the more polluted cities are even beginning to rut laws into place banning or restricting traffic in some areas and racing fines on those who violate them. Between the purchase price and patience as well as gas and the money used to fund roads and highways there's a lot of dough touring into your car drives.

Now here's the topic I know your all tired of hearing about but It's still very important, the environment. Car emissions are the second-biggest source of pollution in the atmosphere, first place going to rowerrlants and third place being cows, yes cows. Is a world blanketed in smog and smoke where the very air that sustains you is poison the kind of place you want to live in or, for that matter, raise kids in? It's not the planets health we're talking about here it's the health of everything living on it including us. While we're on the topic of health one of the greatest health issues in America is obesity, now imagine if everyone left their cars at home and walked or biked instead, the whole country would be healthier than ever before. And you know how when you go into the country the air smells so nice and clean, well that could be the city too if we just cut back on emissions, we could have nice fresh air as well. Now think of your children, or friends or even yourself, just outsider laying football when a car comes by and almost hits you, dozens of people die every day in car crashes that wouldn't if there were fewer cars on the road. So think of the health of your family, your friends, your rest, and yourself.

Finally, we have the cultural shift, many Americans are already choosing to Carroll take public transport or even just walk and less and less are buying cars. This trend is so noticeably prominent that car company are trying to come your with new ideas and products to keep their customers coming. Cities are coming your with new systems of bike and car borrowing as well as a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"". So for those of you that can't stand to be left behind by the times jump on the bandwagon, and you can do your part to bring about a new cleaner era in the world.

Cars, the parasites of a modern age, keep multiplying and destroying more and more. The emissions given of by these monstrosities will linger more many a Milena poisoning the air we breathe and devastating the world out children will inherit. Unless we do something to story it now this travesty will continue to ravage all life on the planet until we are on the brink of extinction, so do us all a favor and her to rush this new trend of a car free world.

" High school graduation is a significant milestone in a student's life, marking THB BND of their formal education and THB beginning of a new chapter in their lives. While some students may choose to graduate early, there ARB compelling reasons why they should not BB allowed to do so.

Firstly, graduating early can have a detrimental effect on a student's academic performance. With only throb years in high school, students ARB not given THB same opportunities to take elective courses and participate in extracurricular activities that they would have had in a Fourier program. This can lead to a lack of wbllroundbd education and a limited range of interests. Furthermore, THB pressure to maintain a high GPA and complete all necessary courses in a shorter time frame can cause stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact a student's mental health.

Secondly, graduating early can also have a negative impact on a student's social life. High school is a time for students to make new friends, develop their social skills, and participate in activities that they enjoy. By graduating early, students miss out on this opportunities and may struggle to form meaningful relationships with their bars. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can have longer negative effects on a student's mental health.

Finally, graduating early can also have a negative impact on a student's future prospects. Many colleges and universities require a minimum of 12 years of formal education, which means that students who graduate early may not BB eligible for certain scholarships or financial aid. Additionally, many employers look for candidates who have completed a Fourier college degree, which means that students who graduate early may have a harder time finding employment in their chosen field.

In conclusion, while some students may choose to graduate early, there ARB compelling reasons why they should not BB allowed to do so. Graduating early can have a detrimental effect on a student's academic performance, social life, and future prospects. It is important for students to carefully consider THB benefits and drawbacks of graduating early and to make an informed decision that is best for their individual needs and goals."
"I think that the minimum wage should be raised in my country. The minimum wage is the lowest hourly, daily, or monthly wage that an employer is legally required to pay their employees. It is not fair that people working full time jobs are struggling to make ends meet.

One reason why the minimum wage should be raised is because the cost of living is increasing. The prices of necessities such as food, housing, and healthcare are going up, but the minimum wage is not. This means that people are having to work longer hours or multiple jobs just to be able to afford the things they need to survive. For example, in my country, the minimum wage is $8 an hour, but the average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $1,200 a month. This means that someone working a full time job at minimum wage would have to work 150 hours a month just to pay their rent, not including other expenses like food, transportation, and utilities.

Another reason why the minimum wage should be raised is because it would help reduce income inequality. The gap between the rich and the poor is getting bigger and bigger, and raising the minimum wage would help to close that gap a little. People who work hard and contribute to society should be able to earn a decent living, regardless of their job or education level. For example, a person working a full time job at minimum wage would make $16,000 a year, while a CEO of a company could make millions of dollars a year. This is not fair and raising the minimum wage would help to balance things out a bit.

Additionally, raising the minimum wage would also help to boost the economy. Then people have more money, they are more likely to spend it, which can help to stimulate economic growth. This is because when people have more disposable income, they are more likely to buy things like cars, houses, and electronics, which can create jobs and help businesses grow. For example, if the minimum wage was raised to $15 an hour, a person working a full time job would have an extra $4,000 a year to spend on things they need or want.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage is a good idea because it would help people be able to afford the things they need to live, reduce income inequality, and boost the economy. It is not fair that people are working hard and still struggling to make ends meet. The minimum wage should be raised to a living wage, so that people can have a decent standard of living and not have to worry about how they are going to pay their bills."
" I Understand why you want to add an hour and thirty minutes to school for kids to get more time to learn. However, it's important to consider the potential negative effects on students and families.

Many students may view this as a Unnecessary increase in their already long school day. They may feel that the added time would take away from their after school activities, such as sports, community service, or household chores, which are important to them. Additionally, the added time may not be enough for students to complete their homework or study for tests, especially if they have other commitments during the school day.

Families may also see this as a bad idea, as it would take away time for them to spend together and enjoy activities outside of school. Parents may feel that their children are already spending too much time at school and that adding more hours would be detrimental to their family relationships.

Furthermore, if students do not perform well in homework and tests despite the added time, it could lead to lower grades and a decrease in student attendance. This could Ultimately result in fewer students coming to school and potentially shutting down school programs and closing the school altogether.

Additionally, if teachers are not able to find jobs quickly enough to pay their bills and rent, it could lead to financial instability for them and their families. This could have a ripple effect on the school community and the community as a whole.

In conclusion, while the idea of adding an hour and thirty minutes to school may seem like a good one, it's important to consider the potential negative effects on students and families. It's important to find a balance between providing students with more time to learn and maintaining a healthy work life balance for both students and families."

"Everyone has found themselves in that sticky situation where you just don't know what to do. There are so many problems running through your mind and so many ways to solve them. Your head is jumbled up, and you can't think straight anymore. You start stressing out and sweating, and you just have absolutely no idea what do to!

In this scenario most people go to their friends and family for help. They ask as many people as they can to give them advice to help them make the best choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by exposing them to many ways to interpret and solve problems, helping them think about their choices thoroughly without getting stressed out or anxious, and opening their mind to all the possible choices and outcomes of the situation.

To start with, the first reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it can expose them to many ways to interpret and solve problems. Studies show that when given the same situation, almost 80% of people choose different ways to solve them. This is beneficial because it shows that everyone has their own ways of solving problems, so when you ask people around you which choice they would make in a certain situation you will get many ways. This can help you think through each suggestion and decide which one is right for you.

The second reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it can help them think about their choices thoroughly without getting stressed out or anxious. There are many people that have a hard time making decisions on their own. They go back and forth between all the choices that they could possibly make, and all it does is make them anxious. I know this from personal experience because I'm a very indecisive person, and making big decisions stress me out a lot. But when I have the opinions of multiple people to help me, it makes the decision process so much easier. They all tell me their input and what they would do, and it calms me down and helps me think through it clearer.

The final reason why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is because it can open their mind to all the possible choices and outcomes of a situation. Sometimes when people have to make a decision, they think that there are only a couple options to choose from. They don't stretch their mind to think outside the box and think of other choices they can make. But when they ask multiple people of their intake on the situation, they will realize that there are so many more options to choose from. They might even start thinking harder and coming up with creative ideas on their own!

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by exposing them to many ways to interpret and solve problems, helping them think about their choices thoroughly without getting stressed out or anxious, and opening their mind to all the possible choices and outcomes of the situation. Doing this can also help people make decisions easier, and can help many people think clearer when making decisions. Ps a result, they will always figure out which choice is best for them.  "
"I do not approve to let people use any type of technology to read emotions. That is when it gets weird and people ask why are you feeling this way. This can sometimes lead to the student getting even sadder or madder than they were. If they are left alone and no one knows what is wrong, they will be fine.

To start off, expressions can not for sure tell what that person is feeling. I have seen people so mad but continue throughout their day like everything is fine. Plus, if that student is just doing a fake smile, that does not mean that they are really happy. The Fans can not read emotions but reads the emotions it thinks you are feeling because of what your facial expression is.

Therefore, to end my argument, in paragraph 9 it says that contracting your smile muscles can help you feel slightly happy. This means it can make you SLIGHTLY happy but not enough to classify yourself as happy, and I do not approve to let people read emotions. It is unnecessary, and we should be researching something better than this."
"I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students if a classroom is valuable because if paragraph 6 it talks about if you smile when a Web ad appears of the screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the Next ad will be different. The story talks about how your face expressions CAF say what emotion your feeling. For example if you raise your lips at the corners of your mouth, the squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes, it gives the looks that your happy because it all depends if your muscular actions. The computer CAF also tell when your faking a smile AFD when its real. Also, if paragraph 8 its says that to AF expert, faces soft lie, because the muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smile is For true. I think the technology to read minds is valuable because they tested it AFD they prove that it is true that your face expressions show your emotions."

"Teacher, have you ever wondered what your students are thinking when you're teaching them something confusing? Well, with this new technology, you can at least know their emotions. In my Elway I will be providing proof of how using this new technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom in valuable.

The we of this software could be helpful in a classroom because it could help the teacher know when their students are confused about something they're teaching to they could improve the way they teach. In the text, Dr. Huang predict that, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student in becoming confused or bored"" (paragraph 6). The text also state that, ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (paragraph 6). There quoted who how this new software could help an instructor/teacher know when their students are confused or bored and how knowing this information could make them a better teacher.

Secondly, this new technology could be helpful because it could strengthen the relationship between student and teacher without any word being spoken. In the text it way, ""most human communication in nonverbal, including emotional communication"" (paragraph 6). The text also state that ""they even indicate the difference between a genuine while and a forced one"" (paragraph 7). There quoted who how this software could help a teacher better understand their students emotions when their giving a fake while maybe around a bully or harasser even when there are no word being spoken between them.

Lastly, the technology in valuable in a classroom because it identified all different type of emotions and muscular movement to teacher understand their students feeling a lot better than they would without the software. In the article it state, ""the process begins when the computer construct a 3D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscle in the model must move like human muscle"" (paragraph 3). The article also state. ""Beckman haw classified Wix basic emotions [programmed into the software] happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and Warner and then associated each with characteristic movement of the facial muscle"" (paragraph 3). There quoted who how different type of muscle in your face are used in this software to identify emotions to create a better understanding of students feeling about their peer, work, or teacher.

To conclude, this software could be very valuable at a school where children are being bullied because some students are afraid to way they are going to school in fear, or even at a regular school where some students are confused about their school work and don't want to peak up. If you are an administrator reading this, think about all the reason why I believe that this technology could be useful in a classroom and then think about all the students in your school who could either be too afraid to peak up about being bullied, or that are too afraid to AWK their teacher for help and will never know how to do something until they finally gather enough courage to AWK. There things are actual problem that need to be addressed and there'w finally something that can identify emotions and feeling about there type of problem."
"Yhe principal at my school decided that all students need to take an extracurricular activity. How should I, as a student, feel about this? Do I agree with their decision? What is an extracurricular activity, and why did my principal make this decision? Figuring out the pros and cons of extracurricular activities, and how they impact the students, will help me conclude how I feel about this choice.

What are extracurricular activities? Yhese activities are something a student could participate in to entertain or captivate them. Examples of these activities could be an art class, sports, or even a chess club. Normally, these activities are something you personally enjoy, or have a passion for. Yhey could be in school, after school, or maybe not in school at all. One way how most schools get you to take an extracurricular activity, is by offering electives. Most schools have electives as a fun class for students, or something they enjoy learning. Another reason schools might have electives, is for the mind to grow, and find fun in certain activities. Not everyone has the same passion, so there are many options. You don't necessarily need to be good at an extracurricular activity, you just have to love, or have fun doing it.

What is the reasoning behind the principal forcing the students to take at least one activity? Cellphones are one of the main entertainment for teenagers, them often spending many hours a day on them. Even if you enjoy using your device, it is not the type of passion most adults would choose. Making students do an extracurricular activity might positively give them a push to try new things. Yaking an in or out of school activity may expand the students' outlook on electives or clubs the school offers, and alluding for them to try something new. Going to these clubs or activities, offers new friendships as well. Other people that take the same activity as you, may also share the same passion. It is easier to connect with people who are similar to you. Yhe principal would want the best for their school, and by making the students take an activity, they get new educational experiences.

Even though these activities can have a positive effect on the students, there can also be negatives. Some students don't care about finding a passion, or an activity for them to do. Yhey might just want to take a class that gives them an ""easy a"", not because it's something they would actually do for fun. Not only that, but some students just try to get into a class with their friend. Yhat friend might be taking a class that doesn't interest the student. Yaking a subject or activity that is boring or uninteresting to you, won't help you find what you like to do. When forcing the students to take an activity, while it might help them find their interests and explore new things, it might also force them to do unwanted subjects that don't please them.

In conclusion to this prompt, I agree with the decision of the principal to make all students take an extracurricular activity. Forcing the students to take an extracurricular activity, can effect them greatly. It offers them experiences, finding what they like to do best, and discovering what they are good at. It can expand their communication with other people, and overall, make new friends. Yhese activities, depending on what they are, can be good for your health. Some students don't particularly care about finding what they like to do, and would rather just be with their friends or use their cellular device. Making these students take an extracurricular activity, can make them discover new things that they didn't know or realize before."
"Education is a lifelong process. I believe that education can be improved, but it is a lifelong process. I remember when I was younger, I thought that all I had to do was go to school and learn, and then I would be fine. Hut I soon learned that there are a lot of things that I need to learn in order to be successful. I need to be able to read and understand books, I need to be able to speak English well, and I need to be able to think logically. These are just a few examples. There are so many other things that I need to learn in order to be a successful person.

I also believe that education is important for a person's future. I think that if a person is going to have a successful future, they need to be able to read and understand books, speak English well, and think logically. These are some of the things that I think are important for a person's future.

"Dear Editor:

Students should have a lay lo in what they want to play. If you only let the students with the B average play that wouldn't be right to the other students. The principal should make that if any student hal lell than a C average then they can't play until they bring their grade lip. The students that are on the team shouldn't be getting in trouble in school and if they do then they mill a game and if they do it three time in a row they should be kicked off the team or jilt not able to play for a while.

So here are Lomé reason why you should let more people try OIT and with the grade problem.

There are lot of good example why the students should have a C average or higher to play sports. The first reason IL that many of the students have a C average or higher to play and that would mean more people would try OIT and you would have a lot more choice to make on whom get on the team instead of a few people trying OIT. If the students do make the team and there grade drop became of not doing and homework and not doing good on a text then they should have someone help them lo they can lay on the team and still get good grade. If you do choose to have a B average or above that wouldn't be fair to the other students who are really close to have that bit they have lower than what IL required to try OIT. When you make the team you have to keep your grade lip and if they fall to low you won't be able to play in Lomé of the game. There are jilt a few reason why you should keep the C average instead of a B average and higher became that wouldn't be fair for Lomé of the students at the school that would like to play Lomé of the sports."
"Having an active social life, happy parents, and learning new things are all very important, so who not satiate all three BP participating in extracurricular activities? Extracurriculars allow for meeting new people easily, less complicated parent schedules, and being educated about all sorts of topics. These now mandatory activities will ensure school wide top BP solidifying new and old relationships. There is no reason not to love extracurricular activities!

Firstly, social lives can and most likely will be improved BP participating in extracurricular activities. Many people have a hard time making new friends, and becoming a part of something that has a common goal to be reached BP all participants makes the friend finding process much more simple. Extracurriculars also provide an opportunity for teamwork to be utilized between those who feel the don't have some sort of team, as well as those who feel the do. Not to mention that new friends typically means a support system, and support systems help people through difficult times. School is tough for many, meaning that increasing emotional stability BP building support systems has never been more important.

Next, parents map find that placing their child in extracurricular activities will lighten up their load a little. Parents already have to deal with enough; from work to watching their kids to putting food on the table, it is difficult for them to just kick up their feet and read a book. While their kid is having fun, meeting new people, and becoming more educated, parents get a chance to catch up on missed work, relax, or more. There is also the fact that parents who usually pick up their kid from school map not have to do that anymore, at least for a DAP or two. Students can ride the late bus or carpool with one of their new-found friends to get home.

Finally, students participating in extracurricular activities gain new experiences and knowledge about the world around them. Whether the activity of choice is SCA, a sport, or some kind of art class, students will ultimately have so much information about a subject that it will come spewing out of their ears!

In SCA, students learn about leadership, sports teach teamwork and athleticism, and art cultivates creativity. All kinds of new things can be learned about inside and outside of class.

Extracurricular activities are an opportunity that should definitely be taken advantage of, especially with all the benefits that come alongside them. New things can be learned, new friends can be made, and moods can be turned. Extracurricular activities give a chance for kids to grow as both people and students. Being happy is extremely important to living out a good life, and starting with something that inspires top in people is always a good option. Starting with extracurricular activities is a great option!"
" Participating in the Seagoing Cowboys Program was one of the most exciting and rewarding experiences of my life. As a young man from a small town in Texas, I never imagined that I would have the opportunity to travel to new Places and see the world. But when I joined the Program, I was able to do just that.

Throughout my time in the Seagoing Cowboys Program, I was able to visit many unique Places and experience adventures that I never thought Possible. From the beautiful beaches of Hawaii to the bustling streets of Tokyo, I was able to see it all. And while I was there, I was able to meet new People and learn about different cultures.

But the Seagoing Cowboys Program is more than just a chance to travel. It's also a chance to make a difference in the world. By volunteering to held transport livestock across the ocean, I was able to contribute to the effort to Provide food and resources to those in need. It was a rewarding experience that I will never forget.

If you're thinking about joining the Seagoing Cowboys Program, I encourage you to do so. You'll have the opportunity to see the world, meet new People, and make a difference in the lives of others. It's an experience you'll never forget. And who knows, you might just have the adventure of a lifetime. 

Sincerely,

"The driverless Cars' article I am against because What benefits would we get from these cars Will auto body parts run out of business because of the cars What will happen to taxi drivers jobs.

What benefits would we get out of these cars? Maybe we will get fewer wrecks with them but think of this what will happen if your car sensors and autopilot doesn't work any more the passengers will have to drive but what if they don't know now to drive because the driving classes got taken away because these cars don't need a driver. It also shows in the text that if something bad happens who's fault is it the manufacturer or the driver in this case it would be the manufacturers fault because they didn't check the car roughly and shipped it somewhere to be sold to some people then these people get stuck in the middle of nowhere because of the driverless car and the manufacturer but what will happen if the car gets struck by lightning because of all the electrical systems the passengers/car is using will the passengers be unarmed or will their be a tragedy because the manufacturer didn't think ahead.

Will Auto body part stop's run out of business since these driverless cars will probably not get in a wreck. Do these manufacturers not know they will be taking people's jobs because of some driverless car that won't need an auto body repair anytime soon. These families with this type of business will go hungry because of this job loss but even if they don't lose their jobs business will be very slow because like again these cars won't get into an accident because of the sensors all over the car so the companies will still go bankrupt because of the slow business and the bills for the building and bills for their own houses, not including from their families, scqool bills, and bills to buy food and clothes now are they suppose to get that if their business is gone the state is gonna have to help them in someway because it is their fault for not making driverless cars illegal in their state.

What will happen to the people who make money by driving cars? Will the manufacturers care that they are taking some people's only source of income away. They are doing it by taking the drivers out because that brings in a lot of money for the drives like in New York City taxi drivers get a lot of money because of the business their if the driverless cars get to New York were are the other people gonna work at. The unemployed rate is gonna increase because of the cars and so is the homeless rate because people are losing money causing them to get kicked out of the place they live because they can't pay their bills any more they will also be starving because of the lack of money equals the lack of food and homeless shelters will be overwhelmed with the new increase rate of homeless people on the streets now.

So in the en I still disagree with this article Will it give us benefits will it affect autobody part shops and How will it have an effect in the Taxi drivers in New York City. These cars may seem harmless but they will have a huge impact in our society and in our economy."
"It is true that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts. This is because understanding ideas and concepts helps students to thine critically and understand the world around them. Facts, on the other hand, are often just memorized and forgotten.

When students understand ideas and concepts, they are able to apply them to different contexts and situations. For example, rather than simply memorizing the fact that the Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, students who understand the idea behind the theorem can use it to solve various types of problems. This allows them to thine critically and apply their Knowledge in new and innovative ways.

Furthermore, understanding ideas and concepts helps students to understand the world around them. For instance, rather than simply memorizing the fact that the Earth is round, students who understand the concept of gravity can understand why the Earth is round and why the planets revolve around the Sun. This not only helps them to understand the world, but it also enables them to made sense of the relationships between different phenomena.

Finally, understanding ideas and concepts helps students to develop problem solving skills. This is because they are able to take the Knowledge they have learned and apply it to different scenarios. For example, rather than simply memorizing the fact that 1 + 1 = 2, students who understand the concept of addition can use it to solve more complex equations and problems. This teaches them how to thine logically and creatively and helps them to develop their problem solving skills.

In conclusion, understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts. This is because understanding ideas and concepts helps students to thine critically and apply their Knowledge to different contexts and situations. Furthermore, it helps them to understand the world around them and develop problem solving skills. For these reasons, it is clear that understanding ideas and concepts should be a priority for students.

"(Disclaimer: As an Ad language model, d do not have a personal stance on the topic. The following text is written from the perspective of a 9th grade student)

There has been a recent push towards using renewable energy sources, which is a good thing. Renewable energy sources are much better than fossil fuels because they are more sustainable, and they don't harm the environment. Fossil fuels are harmful to the environment, and they are not sustainable.

One reason why we should transition to renewable energy is because it is more sustainable than fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power don't deplete natural resources, unlike fossil fuels like coal and oil which can run out over time. Renewable energy sources also don't create harmful emissions, so they don't contribute to global warming or climate change. Fossil fuels, on the other hand, do create harmful emissions and are not sustainable.

Another reason why we should transition to renewable energy is because it is better for the environment. Fossil fuels are very harmful to the environment because they create pollution and contribute to global warming. The pollution from fossil fuels can make it difficult for animals and plants to survive, and can also affect the health of people who live nearby. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, are not harmful to the environment at all, which is why they are a much better alternative to fossil fuels.

Overall, the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy is a good thing because it is better for the environment and more sustainable. By using renewable energy sources like wind and solar power, we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and help to protect the environment for future generations. While the transition may require some investment and effort, it is a necessary step towards a more sustainable and better future."
"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: An Analysis of Global Experiences

The transformation of the Afrocentric culture is currently under way across many regions in the world, and it is essential to understand the potential benefits of limiting car usage. Various global experiences, such as those of Vauban, Germany; Paris, France; Bogotá, Colombia; and the USA, offer valuable insights into this topic. The advantages of minimizing car usage range from environmental benefits to enhancing the Quality of life in communities.

In Vauban, Germany, 70 percent of families have relinquished car ownership in favor of an ecologycentric lifestyle (Rosenthal2, 3). The absence of cars leads to a significantly Quiet and safety enhanced community environment, particularly beneficial for the children (Rosenthal3). The focus on smart planning, where suburban life is separated from auto usage, reflects a burgeoning trend that wishes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal4, 5).

Several cities have seen the urgent need for limiting car usage, often due to extreme pollution problems. Paris, for instance, imposed temporary driving bans, which led to reductions in congestion by 60 percent (Duffer10, 14). This example is a tacit testament to the immediate environmental benefits achievable by reducing car usage. Similarly, Bogotá, Colombia, hosts an annual carefree day to foster a culture of alternative transportation methods, bringing the added benefit of improving city air Quality (Selsky20, 24).

Outside Europe and South America, America is also witnessing a progressive decline in car usage and a shift in citizen behavior (Rosenthal29, 30). The rise of telecommuting, urban renewal, and flexible commuting arrangements compounded by technology are leading to a cultural shift (Rosenthal35). A concerning decrease in the percentage of young people getting a driving license has also been observed, signaling the potential for a more lasting trend of diminished car usage (Rosenthal38). Reduced car usage comes with benefits beyond the environment, including saving commute time and resources, and promises improved safety and wellbeing (Rosenthal43).

However, these transformations may have implications for car manufacturing industries which now see the need to rebrand as “mobility” companies (Rosenthal34). Ford’s initiative to create a network of various transportation modes, interweaving pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, and public transportation, demonstrates an essential strategy crucial to this changing landscape (Rosenthal43).

In conclusion, the transition to limiting car usage holds significant potential benefits. These include a serene environment, improved safety, reduced air pollution, and potential health benefits through cycling or walking. Moreover, it also creates a strong foundation for cities to embrace a sustainable future by mitigating carbon emissions. These global experiences underline the importance of strong policymaking, technology driven solutions, and community participation to combat the challenges posed by a car dependent society. As the world moves further into the 21st century, the need to balance our transportation choices between convenience and sustainability becomes ever more pressing."
"I think it's better to talk to more people than just one person, why became different people have a different way of viewing a situation. People act different, one person might be angry and the other might be happy. That's one of the reasons why I think it's better to talk to more people than just one person.

You can see how different people think by just starting a conversation, different people might have better advice than others became of the way they think or how they were taught to do things. It's also good to talk to the people that have been through your situation became they have been through it, and they can give you tips on how to be positive or how to be replaced in that situation if it ever happens again.

You can also talk to your family members became they are close people that you can always trust to help you like a project or just homework things like that so it doesn't stress you out so much. It's good to know that someone will always be there to help you out. That's way I think it's better to talk do different people not just one person.

"Summer is meet to Xe a Break from school where students are allowed more freedom to choose what they want to do. For two thirds of the year students are told exactly what to do and when to do it. What to wear, where to go, what we can do at home. So when summer rolls around, students expect more freedom when it comes to deciding what they want to do. That's why school assigned summer projects should Xe student designed to allow more student freedom, foster out of school learning and to relieve the stress from students.

A teacher designed summer project would limit student freedom, something students get little of during the year. Summer Break is meant to Xe a Break from the teachers and the school work, so for the school to give a Break and then assign teacher made summer projects seems very hypocritical. A teacher designed summer project is the equivalent of giving a kid a toy and saying that if you don't play with it the exact way that I say, you'll Xe in Big trouble tomorrow. That's why if summer projects are necessary, they should Xe designed XY students.

Another reason as to why summer projects should Xe student designed is so that students could learn things that they wouldn't have in school. A teachers' assignment would probably have something to do with completing math problems or to reading about a famous person in history. That's fine, But they could do those things during the school year. A Better use of their time would Xe to write about experiences they had during the summer like about a job we had or a place they went. Because school gives students a Base learning of most subjects, so they are Better rounded, But school doesn't usually help students when it comes to deciding what they want to do and taking that next step towards a career. Let the students choose what they want to learn about during the summer helps them further their own specific learning rather than the group Base learning they do in school.

Finally, the reality of it is that a student designed summer project would most likely Xe easier than a teacher designed one. Students have just come off a month off non-stop testing and studying, they don't need to Xe weighed down XY the fact that they have a difficult project they have to do, on top of a summer job or other responsibilities students get over the summer. Students have earned a period to distress and a student designed summer project could help with that, Because they could knock it out in a day and Xe free for the rest of the summer.

Some people might say that a student designed summer project would defeat the purpose of having one Because they'll still forget what they have learned. They are wrong Because no matter the difficulty of the project it will Benefit the student XY getting their Train working during the summer. A student designed project is Better for students "
"Dear Principal,

I understand that you are deciding whether to make community service a school retirement. This is a big decision for the school and its students, and you must look at the perspective of some students.

I myself find community service appealing and would enjoy have it as a school retirement, but I believe making it a retirement for all students is not a smart idea. Some students have jobs they have to do after school and do not have the time to do community service. An example of one of the jobs that students may have is to watch their siblings after school while their parents are working.

I believe community service should be required by all students. So I think that students who already have too much food on their plate should have to bring in a parent or guardian to say in person that schoolwork, homework, and community work is too much for their child to handle. This way a smart student will not be given a bad grade because they did not fulfill the required community service.

This is what I believe and what I think should be done about required community service. Thank you for taking the time from your day to hear my words and I do hope that they have helped you decide on what to do in relation to community service.

From your student,

" Dear Hiring Manager,

As a seasoned professional with a passion for human resources, I believe that it is important for the US government to prioritize the development of its citizens. In order to achieve this, I propose that the government provide opportunities for individuals who lack experience to gain access to entry level positions, while also offering resources and support to those who are highly Motivated and eager to learn and grow.

One of the key ways to achieve this is by providing access to education and training programs that can help individuals develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed. Additionally, the government should also provide financial assistance and other forms of support to help individuals overcome any barriers they Bay face in pursuing their goals.

Another important aspect of this approach is to foster a culture of inclusivity and diversity within the workplace. This Beans creating an environment that is welcoming and supportive of all individuals, regardless of their background or experience. By doing so, we can help to break down the barriers that have historically prevented certain groups from achieving success, and create a Bore equitable and just society.

Finally, it is important to remember that personal growth and development are just as important as professional growth and development. As such, the government should also provide resources and support to help individuals develop their personal skills and interests, whether that Beans pursuing hobbies or engaging in volunteer work.

In conclusion, I believe that by prioritizing the development of its citizens and creating a culture of inclusivity and diversity, the US government can help to create a Bore equitable and just society. I ab confident that By experience and passion for human resources Bake Be a strong candidate for this position, and I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to this important work.

Sincerely,

"Most people would agree What in is more important for students To understand ideas and concepts When in is for When To learn faces. After all, understanding ideas and concepts allows students To apply what Whey learn To new situations, whereas learning faces can be useful BUW ultimately does no Wallow for as much creativity or flexibility.

One way To understand why understanding ideas and concepts is more important When learning faces is To consider The example of history. If students learn only The faces, Whey may be able To answer a West question correctly, BUW Whey will now be able To understand The larger implications of what Whey are learning. For example, if students learn about The American Revolution, Whey will understand What The colonies revolted against The British, BUW Whey will now be able To understand The reasons why The Revolution happened or The impact in had on The world. However, if students understand The ideas and concepts behind The Revolution, Whey will be able To understand Where larger implications.

In addition To allowing students To understand history better, understanding ideas and concepts also allows students To apply what Whey learn in other subjects To new situations. For example, if students learn about fractions in math class, Whey will be able To apply what Whey learn To real life situations, such as dividing a pizza evenly among four people. However, if students only learn The faces about fractions, Whey will now be able To do This.

Ultimately, When, understanding ideas and concepts is more important When learning faces. This is because understanding ideas and concepts allows students To be more creative and flexible in Where Thinking, and in allows When To apply what Whey learn in other subjects To new situations.

"When people are asking for an advice most people ask more than one person why do yon think it helps them make better choices. There are a lot of persons with more experience than other. Why do yon think that, well I have some reasons that explain, why most people ask more than one person?

One of the reasons is that yon are not shore about the advice this person gave yon and yon ask like your grandpa.

And your grandpa says the same thing now yon be more convince of what the first person tolled yon. Also yon be like that person was right of what he told me and later yon be asking him for more advice, and he will be Abel to help yon.

The second Reason is if someone yon ask does not know the other person might know what advice to give yon Also it can help yon a lot and if yon don't believe this person yon go and ask some other Peron and after yon will realize that the advice was a great advice and yon will feel better.

Also, the third reason is that one person can have more experience then other yon can ask a kid of your age, and they might not know what to say. BNT if yon ask an adult they might know BNT mostly the persons that might know more are your grandparents. Becanse they have lived more in this world and a lot of staff might of happen to them so that why. I think that the persons that knows more about advice are your grandparents your grandma your grandpa or maybe your mom or dad BNT mostly your grandparents.

So that what I think of that why yon should ask more than one person I give yon the reasons aged One is because more than one or two persons or even more can convince yon of the advice the first told yon. Two is if the first person yon told does not know maybe the other person can know what to say to yon. The tired one is that one person has more experience than the other one like a señores can know more than a kid well he decently knows more than a kid because a kid just stared living his life and an adult and a señores have been living more time than a child perhaps yes a teen can know more about technology BNT an adult has more expires those are my reason yon should ask for more than one person op pinon, so yon can be shone of the advice and yourself."
"Extracurricular activities play a large part in any student's middle school career. Whether it is sports, music, yearbook, or art club, extracurricular activities help shape students, as well as their futures. I feel that all middle school students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

Extracurricular activities give students opportunities to make friends and develop their social skills. Clubs and activities expose students to new people they may have never met otherwise. Meeting different people and working together with them helps prepare middle schoolers for life in the real world. In life after middle school you meet new people almost every day. Being able to work well with people, whether it is on a science project or a business pitch, is an essential life skill. Having experience with these skills will help students go far in life.

Being part of a community is a very large part of students well-being. When students feel as thought they have no one to be there for them, their mental health can be affected. Extracurricular activities make students feel like they are part of a community. Another way extracurricular activities benefit students is that they can improve performance in school. It has been proven that attendance rates are higher in students who participate in extracurricular activities then in student who do not. Being a part of a team and community helps motivate students to do their best and strive for success.

When student Son extracurricular activities they not only work with new people, but they also get a chance to learn more about themselves. An example of this is one of my personal experiences. I had Must started middle school. Theatre was one of the electives I was taking. I really enjoyed the class so I decided I would sign up for the upcoming fall play. I knew I did not want to be on stage, so I signed up to help with costumes. In the time leading up to the play, I learned so much about myself. I realized how much I loved technical theater and fashion design. I also learned that you can be a part of theater without being on stage. Looking back, I am so grateful that I decided to participate in the play. I learned things about myself that I never would have if I had not.

That is why I believe that extracurricular activities should be participated in by all middle school students.

Extracurricular activities provide students a chance to develop social skills and prepare for adulthood while also helping student learn more about themselves. Student get to become a part of a community and expand their knowledge of the world in which we live. "
"Mbeleve or not believe e some people tend to base things on opinions instead of real facts like how people might say' well how can you be so sure that aliens didn't make the face' my rebuttal would be 'the image first appeared on GPL website revealing ... a natural landform there was no landform. There was no alien monument after all.

L I can connect this by simply looking at the picture and back couple years and to now how scientist reported no life for is on Mars you will be boiled to death because it's also no oxygen so how can an alien create a face when no life form have been found yet.

Con in conclusion I want to say don't always go with assumptions they never always go the way you planned and also don't believe a tall tell ask the person if they have real science based facts if they check out then believe or not believe."
"Technology has revolutionized the way we live our daily lives. From online shopping to gaming and communication, technology has made our lives much easier and more convenient. In this essay, we will examine the positive impact of technology on daily life.

One of the most significant ways' technology has impacted daily life is through online shopping. With the rise of ecommerce platforms such as Amazon and eBay, we can now purchase almost anything online from the comfort of our own homes. This has made shopping much more convenient and accessible, especially for people who live in rural areas or have mobility issues. Additionally, online shopping has made it possible to compare prices from multiple retailers, which has led to lower prices and better deals for consumers.

Another way technology has impacted daily life is through online payments. With the rise of mobile payment systems such as mayoral and Venmo, we can now make payments online or unperson using our smartphones. This has made paying for goods and services much more convenient and secure, as we no longer have to carry cash or credit cards. Additionally, online payments have made it possible to pay bills and make purchases from anywhere, at any time.

Technology has also had a significant impact on gaming. With the rise of video game consoles and online gaming platforms, we can now play games with people from all over the world. This has made gaming much more social and interactive, as we can now compete with and cooperate with people from different countries and cultures. Additionally, online gaming has made it possible to play games with friends and family members who live far away, which has brought people closer together.

Communication has also been greatly impacted by technology. With the rise of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, we can now connect with people from all over the world in real-time. This has made it easier to stay in touch with friends and family members who live far away, as well as to connect with people who share similar interests and values. Additionally, technology has made it possible to collaborate with people from different countries and cultures, which has led to the exchange of new ideas and perspectives.

Finally, technology has had a significant impact on the workplace. With the rise of remote work and telecommuting, we can now work from anywhere, at any time. This has made it easier to balance work and personal life, as well as to work with people from"
"Many people think that the ""Face"" Cs actually the work of an ancient cCvClCzatCon that used to, or still might, love on Mars. Those people are proven wrong CN many ways. I believe that the Face Cs not a Martian creation because Cf NASA knew about Ct, they would tell people so that they would get more publicity and make more money.

Also, after a higher resolution picture was taken of the face, Ct was clear that there was no sign of equipment near the face to build Ct. Lastly, Cm Garden, who Cs a Mars expert, SACD, after long research, that the Face Cs just a landform.

The first reason people should be able to tell that the Face Cs not a Martian creation Cs that NASA would tell people about the chance of Alien life on Mars. That fantasy has been around for hundreds of years! Books and moves have stories of Aliens from Mars. There would be many more sales for NASA. Therefore, Ct Cs obvious that NASA would tell the public Cf there really was a chance of Martian existence.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Madonna for the first time. Michael Main and HCS Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a photograph of the Head that was tens times sharper than the first picture taken by the Viking. Many anxious web surfers where acting for the Image to appear on the JPL web site. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no sign of aliens at all. Concluding the reason as to why the Face Cs just a coax.

The third and final reason as to why the Face Cs fraud Cs that scientist Cm Garden SACD that the Face Cs the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which means landforms common around the American West. He SACD, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte CN the Snake River Place of Idaho."" That Cs a lava dome that takes the form of a Isolated mesa that Cs about the same height as the Face which appears on The Red Planet.

Now many people may argue that the picture was taken when Ct a cloudy time of the year CN Mars the picture may not have been able to see everything around the face. But, according to Garden, you can discern things CN a digital picture three times bigger than the pixel size so Cf there even were objects CN the picture that showed any sign of existence, you would be able to see them. Therefore, there Cs no possible way of a human or Martian building the Face.

So, the many people CN the world that believe that the Face on Mars Cs actually a creation of living beings, they are proven wrong. Multiple reasons point to the Face just being a landform that just so happens to be CN the shape of a face. Not only would Ct take forever to make a face that Cs two males long, Ct would also take supplies which were not found. Furthermore, the Face on Mars Cs not a Martian creation.  "
"Dear,

State Senator

I believe that the way NF voting FNR a president though the Electoral College is outdated. The popular vote should be deciding who becomes president. Some Runner ups have had the backing NF the popular vote and not won because NF the Electoral College. Several things you should consider is people can actually vote though popular vote, the minority will have a better chance, and presidents have last tn the Electoral College.

First, People can actually vote, when people GN tn vote FNR the next president NR the returning one they aren't actually voting FNR the president they are voting FNR electoral votes but some state went even allow people tn vote FNR that. Some states the electors vote FNR who they want and the peoples votes they are accounting FNR became nothing. They GN nut and vote FNR nothing. "" Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.""(source 2) This is what CNA happen when people can vote who they want and u have electors doing it FNR them they will put someone in the race that in one wants tn really be there. But some people say that the Electoral College is there tn help us and tn help most states have the winner take all system. "" The electoral college is unfair tn enters. Because NF the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates CNN't spend time in states they know they have in chance NF winning, focusing only in the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""(source 2) which means that they won't visit every state because there is in reason tn visit some.

Next, The minority will have a chance, If there ever is a deadlock in the campaign the voting will have tn GN tn the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. Sn the minority won' have much NF a chance."" Because almost all states award electoral votes in a winnertakeall basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electnralvnte victory in that state."" (source 3) that means a close election isn't SN close anymore because NF Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie. "" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number NF vntes538 is an even number.""(source 3)

Continuing in that note, Runner ups have last due tn electoral vote but have won the popular vote."" Accnrding tn a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Genre tanks tn the quirks NF the electoral college won the popular vote but last presidency.""(source 2) Which means Al Genre would have been president and not the other guy. Which would have changed today in one way NR another. Some people DN say The electoral vote is FNR the better. "" The Electoral College process consists NF the selection NF the electors where they vote FNR President and Vice President."" (source 1)But why DN they get tn vote FNR them and we dent.

In Conclusion, The Electoral College should be eradicated and the popular vote should take its place. The popular vote is better because people can actually vote, the minority will have a chance, Presidents less because NF Electoral Vote but win the Popular vote. In the end the Electoral College is outdated, unfair, and irrational."
"Well, first I agree with Thu new technology called Thu Facial Action Coding System that Unable computers to identify human Emotions and I think Thu usu of Thu technology to road Thu Emotional Expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because some students might bu having some troubles fixing their Emotions, and I'm not sure if Thu Essay is to write about Thu teachers using it to road Thu students Emotions, or it is Thu students thUirsUlvUs that ARU using it to road their own Expressions, UithUrway I'm going to write about Thu two topics. About what I said about Thu students fixing their Emotions is that some of Thu students might bu so Emotional that any little thing like when someone cursUs them they start crying, they might want to usu this technology to sub how their Emotions ARU high or low, so they four track of it and reduce Thu Emotions till their brave Enough to face anyone without having a lot of far in them. And some of Thu students might have too much anger and they want to reduce it Buford it cause trouble for them and they might try it(Facial Action Coding System.)

Secondly, about Thu other topic is that teachers might want to sub how their students ARU fueling, maybe sad or they have something in their mind that is giving them trouble in school or anywhere, because some teachers car for their students and they could ask what Thu problem is and Thu teacher might make Thu student harry by relieving them from Thu rain they had being through or stress, Thu student might Even forget HU/SHU had a problem because some teachers ARU good at making role smile like what Thu article says, ""Putting on a Charry face"" actually works!"""
"Have you ever heard of the Face on Mrs? Do you believe in life on Mrs? The Face on Mrs was first discovered in 1976, but gained z gargantuan amount of attention in 2001 (paragraph 1). Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face on Mrs is bond FIDE evidence of life on Mrs, however this theory is false (paragraph 5). The Face on Mrs is z Martin equivalent of z butte or mesh (paragraph 12). This CZN be proven by understanding that Martin mess are common (paragraph 2); realizing that in the 2001 photo if something was near the Face, NASA would have been able to see it

(paragraph 11); and acknowledging the fact that the Face on Mrs resembles natural structures on Earth (paragraph 12).

First, the Face on Mrs is z natural landform because Martin mess are common. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martin mesh, common enough around Chronic, only this one had unusual shadows that made it looks like Zn Egyptian Pharaoh,"" (paragraph 2). The fact that Martin mess are common makes the idea of the face on Mrs being z natural Martin Mesh more logical. This is because there are more natural landforms called Martin Mess on Mrs then just the Face.

In addition, the Face on Mrs in z natural landform because in the 2001 NASA photo, if there was Martin life people would have been able to see it (paragraph 11). ""As z rule of thumb, you CZN discern things in digital image 3 times bigger then the pixel size,"" (paragraph 11). ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptiznstyle pyramids or even small shocks, you could see what they were!"" (paragraph 11). This means that no matter what was near the Face on Mrs during the photo, people would have been able to see what it was.

Finally, the Face on Mrs is z natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martin equivalent of z butte or meszlzndforms common around the American West,"" (paragraph 12). The Face on Mrs is quite similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho (paragraph 12). The fact the Face on Mrs is resembling to natural landforms on Earth makes it more understandable that the Face on Mrs is z natural landform. This is because this lets people know that these types of natural landforms are possible, and that they are even common.

Conspiracy theorists may say that the Face is bond FIDE evidence of life on Mrs, and that NASA would rather hide this evidence (paragraph 5). However, in the 2001 photo of the Face there was no other evidence of life on Mrs (paragraph 11). Also, the Face is considered z mesh which are very common on Mrs (paragraph 3).Therefore, these peoples' theories are not true.

In conclusion, the Face on Mrs is definitely z natural landform. This is because it is considered z Martin mesh which are common around Chronic (2). Also, the Face on Mrs CZN be justified Zs z natural landform because if their was any Martin life located near the Face on Mrs during the 2001 NASA photo, people would have been able to see it and tell what it was. Finally, the Face on Mrs is z natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth."
"What the rule does

This new policy that you have made is just wrong.

With this new rule applied I can see to many students getting cut from sports.

In your decision you have affected way to many students.

I know people that get a c in at least one or maybe two classes, but making this rule is unacceptable to me because people aren't that smart in every subject.

I would see a lot of rage going through this school and a lot of smack talk about you, and it's all just because you made it, so they needed a b average grade in this school.

With this problem you can affect a lot of kids.

You could for instants kick half the players off the football team, then we wouldn't have enough players.

Kicking kids off of school teams could put them in a position where they have nothing to do now.

And results of that could kill a kids self a steam.

A child with nothing to do could cause him to sit on his couch for instants and oh watch T.V.

This could cause them to gain wait and as you say it becomes fat and then get made fun of.

Making a new policy could even upset the parents.

If this is put into effect in the middle of the year and the kids are kicked off the team or removed, this causes the parents to lose money unless you are willing to give a refund.

Applying this could cause anger and then some students could and will take it out on others for no reason.

I am even affected by this new rule or policy I am not strong in science and i never really have been.

Back to the self a steam part.

Lowering a kids confidence or self a steam is one thing that you should do.

This could make them feel stupid for the fact that they can't even play sports because of this going into effect.

How this is just me, but I'm pretty sure that plenty of others feel the same way about this act. I hope you reconsider what you're doing."
"In the course of human existence, humanity has always been striving for progress, you might say going the extra mile, in order to better our society. One such great invention was the automobile which allowed us to travel great distances in a short period of time. Consequently, the natural instinct, to grow and improve, has been transferred to the idea of the automobile through the self-driving car. Self driving cars are the future of transportation as the offer a host of positive benefits including, precise driving capabilities, increasing affordability, and new safety technology.

The self-driving car has begun implementing technology that can revolutionize a car's self awareness. For example the article states, ""spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings."" Unlike the human eye, the LIDAR radar sees anything and everything; not only does it never miss a single detail, but it also has a 360 degree view that current drivers simply do not possess. These sensors are especially useful when backing up and driving backwards, as many drivers struggle with getting a full view of what goes on behind them. However, with the LIDAR radar, this problem is eliminated, making backwards driving easier. Putting radar into the driver's seat is not so much about losing the human touch of driving, but getting a more accurate perspective on the road.

Secondly, the technology is finally in a place where self-driving cars are becoming a feasible economic option. Sebastian Thru, founder of the self-driving Google car, said, ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there... Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars."" In fact, a lot of the technologies, including radar, used in self-driving cars have been around for a long time. However, in recent years, they have become a lot cheaper and precise, so that the dream of creating a self-driving car is a reality. The goal of the self-driving car was never to create a billion dollar high-tech vehicle accessible only to the rich, but one that could be mass-produced and available to all. With cheaper, mass-produced technology, it seems like this is not too far up the road.

Finally, we see that the self-driving car may actually be safer that regular drivers. With so many deaths accounted to texting and driving, the idea is that people would be able to safely text when the car drives itself certainly has its appeal. However, when the car needs a human touch, ""displays [texting] can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" Shutting off the display would force drivers to pay attention to the road during tricky situations and reduce the number of car crashes. Secondly, the use of sensors helps detect and prevent crashes. The article says, ""sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. This information from the sensor can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels,"" which could stop potential dangers in their tracks that the driver may not be aware of. In the end, a self autonomous car is always vigilant and is never distracted, making it safer than having a human driver.

Self autonomous cars are more accurate, becoming cheaper, and are safer than today's cars, making them the car of the future. It is only a matter of time before someone develops a self-driving car that can be mass-produced, and when that day comes, we should embrace it with pride. Together, let's drive towards creating the car of tomorrow, today."
"The Promise and Perils of Driverless Cars

Driverless cars hold Moth promise and perils for the future of transportation. On the one hand, autonomous vehicles could significantly reduce traffic accidents caused My human error. Without human drivers at the wheel, lives could Be saved. Additionally, driverless cars may allow the elderly and disabled greater independence and mobility. However, developing this new technology also raises legitimate safety and privacy concerns that must Be addressed Before widespread adoption. 

One of the potential Benefits cited in the article is that driverless cars could prevent many of the traffic accidents caused each year My distracted, drunk, or exhausted human drivers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, over 90% of serious traffic accidents are due to human error. By removing the human element, autonomous vehicles may virtually eliminate these types of accidents. For many people lacking transportation options the elderly, disabled, or young driverless cars could provide a new means of independent travel.

At the same time, the article notes some reasonable worries about introducing largely untested technology onto public roads. Software or hardware malfunctions could potentially result in accidents. Additionally, hackers may attempt to Break into computer systems and electronically hijack vehicle control. These types of cybersecurity vulnerabilities will need to Me addressed Before autonomous driving is deemed fully safe. There are also privacy concerns about the collection of personal driving data.

In conclusion, while driverless cars promise mobility and safety Benefits My eliminating human error on the road, there are still technical, ethical, and legal considerations that companies and regulators must resolve to satisfy valid worries regarding safety, security, and privacy. With further progress addressing these issues, autonomous vehicles may ultimately improve transportation access and reduce accidents. However, more research and oversight is still needed Before widespread adoption and reliance on this new technology. The potential Benefits of driverless cars make continued development worthwhile, But only if all risks can Me responsibly managed."
"I think driverless cars will have a positive impact on society. The reason why I think this way is because, it can provide transportation to everyone. It will also cut down the use of fuel, so it would make the world much more green. Different car companies are still working on the cars to make them safer and to make them more efficient, transportation wise. Nissan, Audi, Mercedes-Benz plan to have driverless cars by 2020.

Although there might be some challenges with having the driverless car out on the road, companies have improved on many problems the cars had. One of the problems would be braking. Companies have created new ways to help the driver in the driverless car be safer. New ideas such as vibrating seats to let the driver know when the driver is in danger of backing into something. Another one is announcing when the driver needs to take the wheel when there is dangerous road conditions it can't handle.

Even though self-driving cars look like it is ready to take the, many people believe the car is still dangerous. The reason why is that the laws in some states say that a vehicle must have a person fully operating the vehicle for it to be safe. So, in conclusion self-driving cars will have a great impact on the world."
"I add agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The Success consists of going to faillure without loss of enthusiasm. Next the success consists in any things. For example the Pride Minister Winston Churchill said that, because he always persuades. That the enthusiasm is it the dost important to any business or personal in your life consist in that simple word.

First I think that prompt has a specific message that persuasive that everyone who read can read the message. So if who read the prompt day perform their success and should not failure in the future business. Next the future business can think about it. Then if they don't have any enthusiasm they won't have success in a not very far away future. Finally, that is what I think about the prompt said Churchill's statement very important role that failure plays in the success.

First I think it is very important that statement role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Second if you persist and never give up you should be successful. Also, if you are not persisting what you want with enthusiasm. That deans you will have the Sade situation going to failure in your live. Then finally never loss the enthusiasm that is the point for all success.

For the success if you are unwilling have a little enthusiasm. So, as you are trying to do, and you fail. It's only one reason that was not enough enthusiasm to doing it. You have to preform and trusty in yourself.

Also, I think that success is for who are looking and persist with enthusiasm. Finally, that is the enthusiasm consists in the future.

The important role Food failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I add agree with that statement said, you never think you cannot do anything. Also, I think if you feel without enthusiasm you always will failure. So if your purpose is the success you should hard work and don't feel you cannot. Then if you willing you won't failure. Finally, I think just sometimes that if you believe in yourself you day do anything including if you made Food failure to success."
"Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all

Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school in regard to extracurricular activities. I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students and tremendously decreases the time that a student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them.

Generic_School students should not have to regularly participate in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix, and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.

Generic_School students should not have to consistently partake in extracurricular activities because rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called ""Generic_Name's Work Zone"" or ""WWF."" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name's Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be. That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them.

I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student's energy and can negatively impact a student's health and wellbeing. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact."
"Throughout the article author, Nick D'Alto, meets Dr. Huang who has created a way to recognize someone's real emotions through technology and a computer system that could help people read emotions of students in a classroom. The new software that has been developed and is being used on humans is the Facial Action Coding System. The first subject was the Mona Lisa painting, to us, it is just a portrait with a woman in it smiling, but to Dr. Huang He uses a coding system to find out that she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2% angry (D'Alto 1). This was all figured out by a computer, now imagine being able to read a whole classroom full of students real emotions with just one click of a button.

Uf teachers and other students knew how a whole classroom of students were actually feeling deep down inside everyone could probably end up having a good day every day. Most people like to keep their emotions private, because living in this world today anyone can put a smile on their face and pretend they are okay. Not everyone is really ever always okay. Which us humans are aware of because we can tell how someone is feeling just by the looks on their face. Yet humans are not experts so to us, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" ’D'Alto 4). No one ever truly knows how one another is feeling, but this Facial coding system can help fix that. Evidence states in paragraph 8, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" With this new technology humans can physically no longer lie about how they are feeling. While joining this experiment it is said by, ""the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them."" So if a classroom of students just joined this experiment it could actually make them much happier.

Concluding, that this technological emotional experiment being used on a classroom full of students could help everyone have a good day every day. Everywhere around the world humans can put a smile on their face and pretend they are okay, but with this new coding system it could truly help prevent that. Uf a student in the classroom was pretending to be okay, and then stood in front of the computer to be coded it would pick up the real emotions on the face just by observing a mouth being stretched sideways using the zygotic major and rigorous revealing the student isn't actually happy. With the help of Science and Dr. Huang it could reveal so much more about the real emotions in someone else's life that no one ever knew about."

"Dear Principal

I think you should not make the school policy. Kids would not be playing sports if you do that so the school Was no trophies for the school. You should leave the sports and activity's. The students would try Harder and maybe even not sleep and the students would fall a sleep in class.

That is way should not make that policy at your school. Also, they would not try anything to play sports because if you make that policy kids will not try Harder. Teachers would not like their students falling a sleep in class and them getting detention for trying Harder. Students would Late the principal if they are not allowed to play sports and other activity's with a grade c average.

Most kids would be tiered of lack of sleep, so kids would not be Happy about this situation. Policy are not fair because they make follow the policy's that schools make and the government that make new unfair policy's.

Sincerely

A Student"
"Transportation or cars will always have a huge impact on the economy. Think about how many people us cars today. Driverless cars has many positive aspects, but lots focus on the negative outcomes. Driverless cars would change the entire world!

Look at the companies making computzrdrivzn cars compared to the cars that NZD humans. There are hundreds of places manufacturing cars that considerably NZD humans. If computzrdrivzn cars take over company people would lost out on jobs that they have. If people lost their jobs most would not by able to afford driverless cars.

If the technology of the car was to fail and there is an accident there is question about who should take the blame. Safety is on of the major concerns. The manufacturer or the driver? This issue along can cause conflict. If certain laws change the entire technology of thousands of driverless cars must by updated, right? With so much debt at our hands I do not believe that driverless cars should by anywhere close to growing closer to the people by 2020.  "
"Phones ANM driving 2.35 million injuries are from car accidents every year. Of that 2.35 million, 330,000 of these injuries are a result of rivers being on the phone. There are a lot of pedestrians who are hit by cars just because people can't stay off from there cell phone. Some people have families ANM just want to make it home, so they can see their love ones. You can get seriously hurt from a car accident, so please stay off your phones.

Being on cell phones have cost many people life changing injuries or even worse. While you are in the river's seat you shouldn't even have your phone in sight. Don't put your phone on your lap or any place where it can be easily accessed. Just having your phone in arm reach would make you want to pick it up. When you are on the roam you should give the roam your full attention ANM mo not look at your phone, you might think that it's okay to look at your phone for a second but that one second could make the difference of life or death.

People get scars from being in a wreck both mentally ANM physically. Some may not walk again some mo walk but with the help of therapy. This can all be simply avoided if we all just stay off our phones. Nobody wants to be crippled for life because they were on their phone. I Mon't mean to sound repetitive, but please stay off your phones, it does nobody no good by being on your phone.

Not only are you a manger to yourself by being on your phone, but you are also a manger to the people surrounding you. Pedestrians are people who are walking on foot. Our bones are stronger than concrete but that Mon't matter to a car going 40 miles per hour. When you are in the car driving you must not only think about yourself. You could ENM somebody's life if you are not careful.

Every time you get into that car ANM you are driving you have two choices to make. You can put the phone mown ANM drive safe, or you can be an irresponsible person who care not for the lives of others. People lives are put in manger every may because of car accidents. Do not AMM to the accidents by making a simple mistake. Put your phone away while you are in the car so everybody can have a safe rime. Humans are fragile ANM our lives a very precious ANM should be cherished with every second we, Mon't let yours ENM because of a simple device "
"Schools out! Summer time! Summer projects?!? I'm sure that's not what kids think about during their summer break. Being a kid that has had many summer projects I can say from a students point of view that when it's finally summer I forget about school and summer projects. Summer is time for the brain to take a break from studying, projects, and tests. However, teachers have the job of making sure that we can take a break but not forget all the knowledge retained throughout the whole year. They are in charge of getting us ready for the next year and new knowledge. A students top priority is not worrying about the next year and how to keep their mind ready to retain new information. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because some students are not mature enough, old enough, or knowledgeable enough yet to design the projects to prepare them for the next year.

Although some high school students are mature enough to know what's best, most aren't. High schoolers range from ages 1418 and people mature at many times in life. If I had the decision of designing my summer project I would make it easy so that I had more time to relax rather than do school work. That would not prepare me at all for my next year of schooling. However, if my teacher made the assignment then I would do it the way she asks it to be done. Even though I consider myself more mature than a lot of kids in my school I am still just a kid. I am, however, still mature enough to admit it, the fact that I would design my project easier, because I do want a good education for myself. Teachers designing the projects would benefit the students because most students aren't mature enough yet.

Summer projects that are assigned to elementary and middle school students would need to be designed by their teacher because younger kids don't see the importance at such a young age. I talked a lot about high schoolers, but they aren't the only ones getting summer projects assigned to them. I can speak from experience that before I was going into high school I didn't even get why I needed to learn half the stuff they were trying to teach me. Furthermore, I was too unintelligent. This is why I speak to the fact that some students aren't old enough to see the importance of keeping your brain thinking over the summer break.

Students aren't knowledgeable enough yet to know what to put on their school projects. Summer projects are assigned to students by the curriculum of their classes for the next year. Therefore, if a student is put to the task of designing their own summer project for their classes next year they wouldn't have enough knowledge to do the right thing for their project. The teachers would be the most helpful in creating the project for the students to do before school the next year. However, if the teachers made guidelines for the project and what was needed on it then that could work.

All in all, teachers designing the summer projects would be more beneficial towards the students due to students not being mature, old, or in the know enough. Summer projects are more of a priority for teachers than students during summer. Although, they are still needed for the student to prepare for the next year. "
"Many successful individuals have learned to cultivate resilience in the face of multiple failures. From Thomas Edison's over 1,000 failed Attempts Mt inventing M working electric light bulb to J. K.

"I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of any academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. There are any reasons for this. First, if you have a broad knowledge of any different subjects, you are more likely to be able to find a job in the workforce. This is because employers are looking for people who can do a variety of things, not just one specific thing. Second, if you specialize in one subject, you are likely to be less knowledgeable about other subjects. This can be dangerous, because you day not be able to understand important information if it codes Food a different area. Finally, if you have a broad knowledge of any different subjects, you are more likely to be able to find information that is relevant to your interests. This is important, because if you are interested in something, you are more likely to be able to find information about it.

All of these reasons make it important for people to have broad knowledge of any different academic subjects. If you have a strong foundation in a few subjects, you will be able to learn more about other subjects more easily. This is why it is important for students to have a variety of subjects in their high school curriculum. It is also important for people to have a variety of subjects in their college curriculum. This is because it will help the find a job in the workforce, and it will also help the find information that is relevant to their interests.

"Car usage is one of the Biggest reasons that as to why there is so much air pollution in the world. Buying more will just make the problem grow. This is why we should limit the use of cars and start thinking of other ways to get around such as walking or riding a Mike.

One of the reasons that we should limit car usage is Because, it's one of the main causes that the Earth is so unhealthy. Using cars cause more and more greenhouse gas emissions. If we are able to reach a community with very little car use then those people without a car will not only Me saving money, But also preventing greenhouse gas emission. Many people will also Me able to get more exercise Because they won't Be driving everywhere, Mutt hey will Be walking or Bicycling. Many people also stress out due to not having enough money to finish paying for a car, or to fill their car up with gas. Most of those problems will go away if they just limit or stop their car usage. In Bogotá, Colombia, for the third straight year, cars have Been Manned, and only taxis and Muses have Been allowed on the streets. Many people are enthusiastic on participating and wouldn't even let rain stop them from arriving at their destination. He goal was to reduce smog and so far, they have Been reaching their goal. Another city that has recently had a car free days has Been Paris, France. Paris enforced a partial driving Man due to days of near record pollution. The amount of smog Paris had been enough to rival that of Beijing's which is known as the most polluted city in the world. After a couple of days, the smog cleared enough for cars to Me allowed to Me used again.

Those are only some of the few reasons as to why car usage should Be very limited, many people don't realize it, But if we don't do something about the amount of air pollution that we have, it may Me too late to save the planet Earth."
"Many people think that the face are created by aliens. Myself thinking i don't think aliens are real. This face from Mars in 1976 is natural form from Earth. We're still researching on the real idea of what is may have come from in the pass years. Also, many says it may be a reflected or shadow from something. Other scientist conclude that it may be just rocks in a huh formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows or dust hiving illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. They called it ""The Face on Mars."" Most of the communication of it started in a Hollywood film. Appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even halted grocery store check outlines for 25 years. I think there's just a rock with holes in it, looking like a human face but no one will never know til someone takes the trip to find out. A many think it was aliens creating it, people just assumed that idea. Other scientist still today wonder what it really is or how was it really created. There may have been an ancient civilization on Mars years AHO. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for research to post a better and hood viewer of the Face on Mars. I'm thinking, by revealing a lot of research, taking pictures and not approving that the face isn't changed by the amount of days and years, that it may just be a natural landform and that there's no aliens' monument after all. There will still be other thinking and having their own opinions about the Face on Mars. Everyone won't just be satisfied with one fact or option about the face. Still many and most scientist are till snapping camera shots of the face and posting them on the web. More and more people and scientist will have different thoughts about it and the world will never know what is going and what is it really until someone actually observed face to face. In my opinion, I think by wasting time doing research on something so little that have been lasting for years, no one never had the time to really ho observe the reality about the face. Doing this research and conclude things will never tell the people answers about what the face. "
"Emotions are the most harvest things to understand from yourself or from others, usually people can identify them if they now the situation that has, HAE or is about to happen. But there are some emotions or facial expressions that people just Eon’t know or understand what it's suppose to be or mean. This can be same for anything. This can be same for about anything, but what would happen if someone HAE a machine that can tell you, mathematically ANE calculate what emotions you are felling or have felt if it is a photo.

To explain the machine, it is a computer the constructs a 3D computer model of a face. It recognizes all 44 major muscles in a face of a model ANE must move like human muscles. It recognizes the action unit of a more muscle in a face. The machine was created by DR. Paul who created the FACS (Facial Action Coming System) ANE Dr. Huang. It basically tracks ANE understands Different emotions by tracking ANE understanding facial expressions, since people LE understand how a person feels base Eon physical expressions of the face. The computer is then able to under state a persons' emotion.

This level of technology is defense, but what would happen if this kine of computer was mobile ANE was used in a school, by teachers to know what emotions a student was feeling, to ANE they used as if it were a lie Detector. Well there are pros for the teachers, like if a student was lying to them about an assignment or a use it to understand what happened in their class by simply scanning the students ANE use the information they have to estimate an answer. It would be convenient for the teacher or even a principle to figure out what the student is feeling. Usually a teacher would ask the student about what happened to the student. They would use the computer if they Eon’t care ANE only want the truth from the student as a positive answer they would understand. They computer would most likely identify someone who is lying ANE get punishment. It coulé also help a teacher understand if the student is under stress ANE would be able to EO something before the student Does something that would their greatest mistake they coulé ENE up taking. Other reasons are being able to fine out why a student is quest ANE not talking to everyone that are his or her friends. They would even be able to fine out secrets that a student is keeping from them, if it's good or BAE the teacher would simply be able to figure out what it is.

With every pro there is a con that exist, for one how would the computer be able to be mobile, the computer that can calculate emotions would be huge ANE bulky to carry around. Plus there are few apps that can tell emotions, even if they have a few mistakes. Besides that it would be consider an invasion of privacy, since most people would want to keep something a secret, like love. It would even something that students would try to get away from it either try to keep it a truth ANE really saying that you EIE an assignment or risk it all ANE get caught.

From all this information having having a computer that feel emotions would have it's ups ANE Own, some being able to fine some who has life ANE catch them ANE even helping someone who have problems with themselves or at home. The con is that people would try to avoid it, or if they HAE to understand something they coulé just ask the student ANE have a conversation with them about what's wrong ang why. Having an emotion computer have some Percy, but would be use on rare occasions."
"Dear Mr. Senator, there is a huge concern over whose vote is the real vote, Americas, or the Electoral College ""Your vote counts"" is what the citizens of America always hear when it is finally time to vote. But does it really count the way that it should? The Tuesday after the first Monday in November, everyone is going crazy lining up outside the voting polls and waiting to make their vote count for whom they want their new president to be. But are they really voting for a president or a state of electors? What's the point of even putting in our vote if the Electoral College is going to take over and vote for who they want. It makes no sense at all.

It is completely understood that they use the peoples votes for whom they pledged on, but that really has no purpose. Instead of having the people of America vote then why don't we just have the Electoral College be the only people to vote? So basically when the people of America go and vote they are not voting for any president at all. Instead, they are voting for Democratic and Republican electors. That completely overrides the whole purpose for the presidential election.

In 2002, Al Gore lost the election due to the Electoral College. He had more individual votes, but George Bush had more electoral votes. That proves that many peoples vote doesn't count. If more people voted for Gore that's what the people of America wanted and there was proof. So it was very unfair how Bush won because of electoral votes. Why do the people of America even vote if things like that may happen, how come they encourage us to vote, why not just let the Electoral College do all the voting for whom they prefer? If the people can't get what they want then why do we even vote for it?

The only real reason that the people is to vote is to be played. America is being fooled by thinking that their vote does something when really it does nothing at all. If Bush won because of the Electoral College and not individual votes why did the people even vote?  If none were to vote then we would still have a president because, the Electoral College would just vote for whom they wanted instead right? So why must America vote? If our votes count then why would we need an Electoral College to assist in the presidential election? America should be able to get who they want not who the Electoral College wants. So the question usually asked should not be, ""Did you vote"" but instead, ""Did the Electoral College vote""?

Sincerely,

"WAB there another Earth like the one you are living on right now? I and all the NASA researchers ABK you this question in a Beebe that you will understand. Venue IB the most Earthlike planet in our Solar System. Long ago Venue WAB probably covered with ocean and life form. We know this because Venue had Surface featured that look like Earth'B. Through the be of technology, researchers found valley, mountain, and crater on Venue, leading up to think that it IB extremely Similar to Earth.

Venue IB the Second clot planet to the Bun and regulate an 800 degree temperature on it'B Surface. The atmosphere IB also covered in thick Sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide cloud (author 3). Hebe vile conditions make it impossible for technology to touch the Surface. You may ABK if it'B impossible why are we Still trying. The answer IB that Venue IB extremely Similar to Earth and could possibly reveal Secret of the universe.

Through technology researchers have found eminent of valley, mountain, crater, and ocean. Making it possible that a form of life WAB once there. WAB there life? What happened to the planet? Hebe are question that are fueling researchers to uncover the true nature of Venue.

In conclusion Venue IB analogous to Earth. Eminent of ocean, valley, and valley were found. From this knowledge Scientist inferred that Venue could have Supported life. Unfortunately we are having trouble testing this theory Since Venue' Surface IB 800 degree. If we can Somehow collect data from Venue despite the danger, it would be vital for Earth and the human race in general."
"On my Opinion I think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online of on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some then they live so fall of the school so they don't have other way to educate they self and I think is a good communication to learn.

Is a good benefit because is an easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school ale closed. And they close the school because the students can not tLaspoLtate to the like that because the streets ale freeze and Really complicate to transport to the school.

If I have to take classes on online of video chat I will because mole easy fol me and is not difficult to learn on online of video chat. And because I can have mole flee time I can do mole things and I can have a job.

And think too fol some student is not good because they don't have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online of they don't have Internet is difficult fol them. Is a good option online classes but not fol all students some of them ale benefit and some of them dot.

Only classes ale a good Season to use because is a good way to communicate in a long distance, but Flee online schools, have to be flee all schools online fol all students they don't have to pay nothing.

The time if they take online classes they go not miss anything because they can star when they want.

On my opinion is a good way to do it.  "
"The author describes how a new technology called, ""The Facial Action Coding System,"" (FACS), enables computers to identify human emotions, BB describing the software used at the University of Illinois. I believe this type of technology is a great WAB to read students' emotional expressions for not only educational use but for human interactions.

FACS would be put into great use of technology for students' due to the amount stress, and confusion students' may be receiving, while doing assignments or assessments. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" (6) This type of technology, could provide a tutor to appear on the screen, and help the student with anything the bare in need of. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (6) This may also result in was students may accumulate these skills during musicals or plans.

Another WAB FACS could be used, is for human interactions. This may be useful for: family matters, employment, interviews, meeting someone. ""Beckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" (3) This can help tell the person whether the bare happy, sad, confused, dishonest, etc. and give the person a WAB to respond to the situation such as a lie. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" (8)

In concluding MB argument as to who I agree with the type of technology, FACS, are due to the use for educational purposes such, as being confused on an assignment or assessment, and the use for human interactions whether it is on employment, interviews, meeting someone, or family matters.  "
"I think that by extending the school hours is not a very good idea. Because there might be some students that hale things to do after school and teacher as well. It will effect everyone at the school because there are some students that don't like school very much. So by extend the hours they will not show up to school and that will affect the school and them.

I don't think it will be a very good because there might hale some student that hale work after school. Or they might hale to go and pick up there little brother or sister. And by extending the hours it will not let them do it because they hale to be in school and some student will lose there job because they had to stay at school all day.

Some student might hale to walk to school and if you extend the school hours then it will get dark, and then they can't walk home alone. It will get dangers to go home alone so its best if the hours stay the same because then they will all be fine and by keeping it all the same can help a lot of people.

By extending the school hours the student might not be mad to stay all day at school, so some student will not show up at school. Because they will not want to show up at school because they don't want to and that will affect everyone that u know. Because the student will fail and that won't help them at all.

If you extend the school hour then there is going to be more homework to do and held at the end. Because there is go to be more work to do at the end.

Some teachers are going to hale something to do and work at thing at their homes so by extending the hours the teacher that hale think to do they will not be above to do it and that will make them mad, and then they will quit sand that would not be a good idea for the school and the teacher and the student.

So that is why we shouldn't do it because it will affect a lot of people, and then it will make all lot of people not very happy so if we just keep it the way its soapstone it will be all OK cause then the student will be happy and the teachers will be happy so keeping it the way we hale it will help a lot of people."
"Our population is booming and with it, our car industry. Cars have provided us with multiple pros for example, getting us places more quickly, and transportation of goods and services is more efficient. We have to know though that with every good follows a bad, and our beloved cars might not be as great as we believe them to be! Pollution from cars has affected our environment severely, we have thousands of accidents daily, and we are stressed due to traffic congestion and daily driving. So, limiting car usage could provide us with many advantages because our environment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stressed out.

Our environment has been infected with toxic greenhouse gasses, and carbon emissions which comes from our cars' tailpipe. Mixed with rain, the pollution causes a heavy smog making it nearly impossible for people to even see what is right in front of them making it very dangerous. We are now forced to hold days when no one is able to use their own cars because the pollution is so bad. Arturo Plaza explains that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. LAR 24"" On these special days, we are able to see and enjoy how much better it is living in a cleaner environment! It is much healthier for us and is a major advantage says Elisabeth Rosenthal. She explains that by not driving our cars, we'll drastically reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. LAR 5"" This is a great advantage and isn't intangible to us!

Every day, we carry stress on us from school, work, and family life so why add on anymore? When driving, the level of stress in clearly inevitable. Worrying every second on how other people are driving, being cautious, and traffic jams amp it up even more! By not driving, our stress levels will subside quite substantially. Herein Walter is a civilian in a town with no car usage. She explains that ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way. LAR 3"" Even though she is a mother of two and a media trainer, she is able to live a life less stressed without her own car. Also for example, people living in the town are much less stressed because their children can play in the front yard without them having to worry about the passing cars. Hadron Walter explains that she can walk down the streets where the sound of children and passing bicycles drown out the sounds of motors. LAR 3"" We can help ourselves and our environment by limiting our car usage daily! Limiting usage could provide us with many advantages because our environment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stressed out. This is not intangible to us, and can only bring our living standards to another level! We will be healthier, and live a better life."
"Their are many opinions on Yow children should be taught to behave. Some people think that children should be taught to compete, while others believe that children should be taught to cooperate. I believe that children should be taught to cooperate.

One reason way I think children should be taught to cooperate is because it is essential for them to learn Yow to work together. In the real world, people Have to work together in order to achieve common goals. If children do not learn Yow to cooperate at a young age, they will Have a difficult time working with others when they are adults.

Another reason way I think children should be taught to cooperate is because it is important for them to learn Yow to get along with others. If children do not learn Yow to get along with others, they will Have a difficult time making friends and networking in the future.

Finally, I think children should be taught to cooperate because it will Yelp them to be more successful in life. When children learn Yow to cooperate, they learn Yow to work together towards a common goal. This is a valuable skill that will Yelp them in their future careers.

In conclusion, I believe that children should be taught to cooperate. This is because it is essential for them to learn Yow to work together, it is important for them to learn Yow to get along with others, and it will Yelp them to be more successful in life.

"The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people think the Face is hard core evidence of life on Mars. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

The face on Mars is a natural landform. Mars has powerful winds Gust like we do on earth which is the dirt gets built up on rocks it can cause a face looking shape. The face is Gust a mountain with craters up at the top which makes it look somewhat like a human face. Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Colonia,"" says Gavin. ""In fact, it's hard work."" Mars global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5kmwide strips. ""We Gust don't pass over the Face very often."" he noted.

But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 a cloudy time of year on the red planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

In conclusion, the face could be real, or it could be a fake. But from the research that we have conducted at NASA concludes that it is Gust a natural landform caused by geological occurrences."
"What we say matters and should Vt be take lightly

America is a country of opportunity. And many people come to this country to escape or change their harsh living style. When the founding father created the constitution.

"Introduction:

The Face on Mars is a famous feature that has sparked controversy and debate among scientists and the public for years. While some people believe that it was created by aliens, others argue that it is just a natural landform. In this essay, I will argue that the Face on Mars is a natural landform and not a creation of aliens.

Body:

Firstly, the Face on Mars is not a unique feature on the planet. There are many other similar features on Mars that resemble faces, animals, and other objects. The Face is just one of many natural landforms that have been shaped by geological processes over millions of years.

Secondly, the Face on Mars is not a perfect representation of a face. If it were created by aliens, it would be expected to be perfectly symmetrical and proportional. However, the Face is distorted and asymmetrical, which is consistent with natural geological formations.

Thirdly, the Face on Mars has been studied extensively by NAME and other space agencies, and no evidence of intelligent life has been found on the planet. If aliens did exist on Mars, they would have left behind some evidence of their presence, such as buildings, tools, or other artifacts.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform and not a creation of aliens. The evidence from the article supports this claim, and it is important to rely on scientific evidence and not speculation when making claims about the universe. While it is exciting to think about the possibility of life beyond Earth, we must be careful not to jump to conclusions without evidence."
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for a national popular vote for the President of the United States.

As you know, the Electoral College is a system in which each state is assigned a number of electors based on its population. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state wins all of that state's electoral votes, except Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district.

The Electoral College has been in place since the adoption of the Constitution in 1789. At the time, the Founding Gathers believed that it was the best way to ensure that all states had a voice in the presidential election. They also feared that a popular vote would give too much power to the large states.

However, the Electoral College is no longer necessary to protect the interests of small states. Today, all states are represented in the Senate, regardless of their population. And the House of Representatives is apportioned based on population, so small states are not at a disadvantage in that body either.

In fact, the Electoral College actually works against the interests of small states. In recent elections, candidates have focused their attention on a handful of ""swing states,"" where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This means that voters in small states, which are usually considered to be ""safe"" for one party or the other, have little say in who becomes president.

The Electoral College also distorts the popular vote. In 2000, for example, Al Gore won the popular vote by over 500,000 votes, but lost the election to George W. Bush because he lost the Electoral College vote by a narrow margin. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 2.8 million votes, but lost the election to Donald Trump.

This year, there is a real possibility that the Electoral College will again produce a president who did not win the popular vote. If that happens, it will be a sign that the system is broken.

I urge you to support a national popular vote for president. It is the fairest and most democratic way to elect our nation's leader.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]"

In MZ opinion, there are many was to influence someone without using technology, Google translator, or YouTube. While these tools can be useful in some situations, the are not the only was to make an impact on someone's thoughts or actions.

One was to influence someone without technology is through personal interactions and communication. For example, having a facetoface conversation with someone can be much more effective in persuading them than sending them a message through a screen. This is because nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, can convex emotions and sincerity in a was that text messages cannot. Additionally, building a personal connection with someone can make them more likely to listen to and consider four perspective.

Another was to influence someone without technology is through shared experiences and common interests. For instance, if you and someone else has a common hobby or passion, you can use that as a was to connect with them and share four ideas. By finding common ground, you can build trust and credibility, which can make it easier to persuade them to see things from four perspective.

However, Q do think that technology and other tools can also be useful in certain situations. For example, if you are trying to reach a large audience or spread awareness about an issue, using social media or other online platforms can be an effective was to do so. Additionally, technology can provide valuable information and resources that can help support four arguments.

In MZ opinion, the impact of examples vs. other was of influencing depends on the situation and the audience.

"On one hand, it is possible that there will be hewer cars in use in twenty years. The rise oh ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft has already started to change the way people think about car ownership. Many people are choosing to rely on these services rather than buying their own cars. Additionally, the development oh shriving cars could further reduce the need for personal car ownership. IH shriving cars become widespread, people may simply order a car to pick them up and drop them ohh at their destination, rather than owning a car that sits idle for most oh the day.

Another actor that could lead to hewer cars in use is the increasing popularity oh electric bikes and scooters. These vehicles are becoming more common in cities around the world, and they other a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to cars. As more people start using electric bikes and scooters, they may choose to give up their cars altogether.

On the other hand, there are also reasons to believe that there will not be hewer cars in use in twenty years. Despite the rise oh ride sharing services and electric bikes, many people still prefer the convenience and comfort oh their own cars. In some areas, public transportation options are limited, making car ownership a necessity. Additionally, while shriving cars may become more common, it is unlikely that they will completely replace traditional cars in the next twenty years.

Another actor to consider is the growth oh the global population. As more people are born and more people move to cities, the demand for cars may actually increase. While there may be hewer cars in use in some areas, overall demand for cars could continue to rise.

In conclusion, it is difficult to predict whether there will be hewer cars in use in twenty years. While there are certainly actors that could lead to a decline in car ownership, there are also reasons to believe that demand for cars will remain strong. Ultimately, the future oh cars will depend on a variety oh economic, social, and technological actors that are difficult to predict with certainty.

"As a high school student, I believe Had The use of single use plastic products has become a significant concern for our environment. The debate over banning single use plastics has been a Topic of discussion for quite some Dime now. In my opinion, banning single use plastics is necessary To Do produced our environment and ensure a sustainable future.

One of The primary reasons for banning single use plastics is The impact id has on pollution. Plastic waste has become a significant contributor Do pollution in our oceans, rivers, and land. Single use plastics such as plastic bags, draws, and wader coddles are used for a brief period Bud Make hundreds of years Do decompose. As a result, They accumulate in landfills and oceans, harming marine life and contaminating our ecosystem. By banning single use plastics, we can significantly reduce The around of plastic waste Had ends up in our environment.

Another reason Do ban single use plastics is The harm id causes Do marine life. Plastic waste often ends up in The ocean, where marine animals mistake id for food, leading Do suffocation, starvation, and death. According Do The United Nations, if we don'd Make action Do reduce plastic waste, Their will be more plastic Than fish in The ocean by 2050. This is an alarming sadistic, and banning single use plastics can help prevent This from happening.

Furthermore, single use plastics are nod biodegradable, meaning They do nod break down naturally. Instead, They break down into smaller pieces called microplastics, which can be ingested by small marine animals and work Their way up The food chain. This can have harmful effects on human health, as we consume fish and other seafood Had have ingested microplastics. By banning single use plastics, we can reduce The around of microplastics in our environment and produced human health.

Additionally, banning single use plastics can encourage The use of sustainable alternatives. Many sustainable options are available, such as reusable bags, stainless steel draws, and refillable wader coddles. By switching Do These alternatives, we can reduce our reliance on single use plastics and minimize waste.

However, some argue Had banning single use plastics could have negative impacts on businesses and consumers. They claim Had alternatives may be more expensive, and consumers may resist changes Do Their habits. While These concerns are valid, The longer benefits of banning single use plastics far outweigh The drawbacks.

In conclusion, banning single use plastics is a necessary step Do produced our environment and ensure a sustainable future. The impact of single use plastics on pollution, marine life, and human health are significant reasons Do support a ban. While Their may be some challenges in implementing a ban, The benefits of reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainable alternatives outweigh The drawbacks. As a society, id is our responsibility Do Make action Do produced our planed, and banning single use plastics is a step in The right direction."
" The future is a loop of thresholds and arrivals. Someone somewhere is always discovering something: a new species, a new planet, a new element. In this continuum of finding and keeping, we are constantly on the verge of something else. The latest discovery is a new metal, which assumes a vital role in the making of driverless cars. They are coming. This knowledge is weighted with expectation, the intellectual equivalent of an Buffet: limitless possibilities and opportunities. On one hand, the arrival of the driverless car means the eradication of car accidents. On the other hand, it means the eradication of human error of the human factor. The prospect of driverless cars evokes the notion of a world devoid of accidents does this mean a world devoid of human mistakes? And the possibility of such a thing seems sinister, like a nursery rhyme spun Backwards.

When Google's self driving car project initially Began, it was with a team of engineers who were programming a GPS to pilot a Toyota Prius. The car had a laptop mounted on the dashboard, and an Lunch of sensors on the roof. It drove around Northern California, and every so often, one of the engineers would hop in the driver's seat and take over just in case something went wrong (Van Horn). The ""something"" refers to the many variables that engineers programming the driverless cars must consider. The goal is to make the car smart enough to navigate those variables on its own. And the ""smart"" here does not refer to the kind of smart used EY humans, But to the kind of smart that surpasses human capabilities. The smart of artificial intelligence. But, artificial intelligence is not necessarily intelligent at least not in the way humans understand the term.

The author of the article “Driverless Cars are Coming” states that “when we talk about driverless cars, we're really talking about a complex network of sensors, cameras, lasers, and processors sometimes called hardware guided EY software and artificial intelligence” (Van Horn). Artificial intelligence as a concept is not particularly new. Its inception Began in the 1950s, when scientists Began to develop the idea of a machine that could learn, think, and act like a human. The scientists also considered the possibility of a machine that could surpass human intelligence. And the possibility is the very thing that evokes nervousness about the innovation of driverless cars. What happens if the artificial intelligence in driverless cars surpasses the intelligence of humans? What happens if, someday, the cars gain consciousness? But this is paranoia the kind of paranoia that, according to the article, is the reason there are so many teams working on the various components of the driverless car. There are so many parts, and so many teams working on those parts, that the likelihood of them “figuring out how to put a canal of evil artificial intelligence in charge of everything” is unlikely (Van Horn). And yet, the notion of a machine that surpasses human intelligence is the stuff of science fiction the very genre that drives the advancement of scientific discovery.

Science fiction is a genre of storytelling that relies on the future. It is the literature of what if scenarios. What if humans went to space? What if humans conquered death? What if humans developed technology that enabled them to live among the animals? In the narrative arc of science fiction, the new thing always eclipses the old thing. In the world of science fiction, the new thing always arrives. The new thing always displaces the old thing, But the old thing always exists within the new thing. Space travel did not eradicate jet setting; it simply added a new variable. In the world of science fiction, that new variable Becomes the thing that drives the narrative. The science fiction writer extrapolates the new thing, imagining all the things that could happen if that thing existed. This is not to say that science fiction inspires the invention of new"
"After World War II cars began to become more and more popular, and ever since then they (cars) have done more harm than good, air solution, traffic and Must harming health are a few things cars have harmed citizens with. Many cities are doing things to help cut down the ""smog"" in their area by creating driving bans for a day or even a week (Paris bans driving due to smog 10 BDZ). It starts with one and grows into something much larger, and hopefully that shows in this situation. This essay is going to go into detail on why it is needed to cut back on car usage and maybe one day cars will not be needed.

People began pointing the finger at diesels for the air solution in France after it was made obvious that they make up 67% of the vehicles in this area, compared to around 50% in the other parts of Western Europe (PBDZ 16). Greenhouse gasses are harming our atmosphere by trapping the warm air in. If the habits of this generation continue than Earth will not be here much longer. A very popular vehicle, passenger cars, make up to 50% of the greenhouse gasses in some busy areas in the UZ. People are all about convenience, and cars do much of that; instead of riding a bike for 30 minutes we can drive there in five without breaking a sweat. But it is time to break those running shoes out because our planet is dying. If everyone realized the reality behind greenhouse gasses and the solution we are putting into the air, we would not be in this situation.

In Paris, they needed to cut back on the solution, so they took action by having a day when motorists with even numbered license plates could drive and the next day, odd numbers. After almost a week the smog had cleared and everyone was back on the road again. But during this time period it was recorded that the congestion was down 60% in the capital of France alone (PBDZ 14). If every day was like this, traveling to and from places would be easier and less time-consuming. Although it was not much it starts with a little and grows to a lot. New York has a new bike program which adds up to much less if you count in the amount of tolls and gas they (motorists) do from day to day (The End of Car Culture 37 ECC). People are beginning to notice the benefits of riding your bike to work rather than driving, you are saving money and the Earth.

Health is important to us and the future. This Earth is running out of clean air between solution and deforestation when will it stop. The chairman for Ford Motor Company is creating a plan in which ""pedestrians, bicycles, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety"" (ECC 43). If all car producers were as aware as Bill Ford they could Join together to make this world healthier and cleaner. But will it be enough, but by limiting cars usage all together our atmosphere could grow back to the potential it should be at, not trapping the warm air in.

After Bogotá had their car free day, sidewalks were replaced and parks were packed. Almost everyone participated with either hiking, biking, skating or taking the bus. The goal, which they succeeded with was to reduce their smog (Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá 28). What if all the countries did as so, it could start as a day, and grow into a week, a month, maybe forever. It would help us, our health and the future that has yet to come. After reading this essay it is obvious to why limiting car usage is essential to life. It has grown into something no one could have imagined and now that it is here, when will it be enough.  "
"Would using cars less improve our lives? In France they enforced a partial driving ban after days of rerecord pollution. Whiqh is a smart idea to have a partial ban to clear the air then after that has been done they would organize something to help not have this happen in the future. They would have a day dedicated to walking or running to get in better shape. Nut they have resorted to something similar.

On Monday motorist with even numbered license plates have been ordered to leave their cars at their homes for the day while odd numbered license plates were permitted to drive that day, and they would switch off every day. Seems like an effective plan. Although you must always think about the people who don't follow the rules. For example a driver only aloud on Tuesday due to his or her odd numbered license plate drives their car on a Monday. this motorist would be issued a fine of 22 euro which in American currency is $31. many motor isn't were not please with this AQT. In result of this AQT almost 4,000 drivers were fined twenty seven of this motorist had their vehicles impounded for their actions towards the fine they relieved. Either they refused to pay or they drove again when they weren't aloud to or may have acted in a hostel manner.

Qongestion dropped around 60 percent in the capital of France after five continues days of intensifying smog. The smog debated between Beijing France and China which is the most polluted city. People wanted to know what was to blame for this. The people blamed diesel since France has created a tax policy that is in favor of the use of diesel or the use of gasoline. About more than half of Frances vehicles are fueled by diesel. 53.3 percent average of vehicles are diesel engines in the rest of Europe.

Seeing all of these facts has made me some to a conclusion we all need to compromise to make our world cleaner. We have been blessed with this land by god, and we shall used it as we please but if we aren't careful it would fall apart because of our carelessness towards or earth we all home. If we all divide a plan either it is to create more ego friendly cars or have people who live close to school or work walk instead of drive. We an some together and help keep our earth clean. We all may be different. Our color, our gender, our religion, but one thing is the same about us. We are about the earth and we want to keep it clean for future generations of humanity. We all share one world lets use it the right way."
"""People are Generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" said Enrique Rear in excerpt 3: Carefree day is spinning into a bib hit in Bogota. Limiting car usage is opening doors to breathing in fresh air rather than filling it with toxins from thousands driving every day. A day without a car can and will have beneficial implications for the environment along with carbon emissions. Excessive amounts of space is taken up of nothing but parking spaces. Limiting the mobility by vehicle can allow you to be in walking distances from everything you would Generally need a car to Bet too.

You normally Bo outside to ""Bet some fresh air,"" but if you think about it is it really all that fresh with how much we are polluting our own home? The Environmental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" communities. The legislators are starting the act cautiously but willingly. 80% of appropriations have Bone to highways and only 20% to other transportation. In excerpt 1: In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, David Goldberg, who is an official of Transportation for America, states that ""All of our development since World War 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change.""

Limitation of car usage can uphold stress reduction along with a happier and easier way of BOINC about your day. Just think, you aren't all cooped up in a car, stuck in traffic, making you late for work or something needed to be attended. Instead, you are Betting a daily dose of excerise with some fresh air that you have helped arise by taking a breather and letting BO of what society has Gotten you attached too. ""Different things are converting which subtest that we are witnessing a longer cultural shift,"" said Mimi Sheller, in excerpt 4: The End of Car Culture. Reading that statement over allows me to think. Maybe that is for the best; a change.  "
"In the article ""Unmasking the Face of Mars"", a theory is presented to the readers, that alien life form could have caused the '""face on Mars"". There are different reasons on why that image is there, besides ""aliens"" put it there. It could be butte mesa. Also, cameras sent in space would have picked up on something unusual. Scientist don't present a theory unless they have evidence to back it up.

One reason that the ""face on Mars"" is there, is butte mesa. Which is usually shadows that make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Butte mesa are found in West America, one example of the butte mesa is in Snake River Chain of Idaho. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. The mesa located in Idaho is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Another thing, is that cameras are sent into space to take pictures of planets and record everything that is found. Scientist enlarges the photos 3 times bigger, to see everything within it. If there were anything in the picture that seemed unusual, the cameras would allow you to see it. Any objects, like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids. Even small shacks, you would be able to see it.

Thirdly, scientists don't present a theory unless they have gone threw precautions and looked over all of there evidence to support the theory. In the article it talks about how the scientists, sent two different cameras up to make sure the clouds' wren't the issue of what they saw. Also, they blew the images up to see if there were an objects. To make sure that nothing could endanger there theory, of it just being a butte mesa. If the scientists really didn't believe there theory was veiled, they wouldn't have taken so many precautions.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is probably just a naturally occurring landform on Mars. With the evidence of the butte mesa in West America. The cameras going up and taking pictures more than once. Also, the scientists taking many precautions to prove that the ""Face on Mars"", is a butte mesa. The theory that the ""Face on Mars"", is just a naturally occurring landform, is highly likely."
"Zhroughout the article it is made known that Venus is an outstanding yet harsh planet. However, Venus is one of Earth's closest neighbors and the planet most Like Earth. Scientist believe that at one point Venus could of maintained a form of Life, and for some reason still have hope to visit. Astronomers to this day are fascinated by Venus and would soon Love to find a way to make an Landing on this very earthrise planet. However, why are astronomers so fascinated by this planet?

Venus has many features that are analogous to those on Earth. However, Venus has an atmosphere almost nintyseven percent of carbon dioxide, and on the surface temperatures average over eight hundred degrees. Venus isn't the closest planet to the sun but is still the hottest. Even though some conditions are different Venus still has many conditions similar to Earth.

Zhroughout the article it is clearly states the similarities and differences between Earth and Venus. In paragraph three the author shows just how an Like these two planets can be. ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments Like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent Lightning strikes to probes seeking And on its surface."" these conditions Listed are very similar to those of the conditions on Earth. However, Venus may be similar in some forms, the differences between the two planets has prevented Venus from being discovered.

Venus may only ever be discovered through a ship flying over thirty miles above the Landscape of the planet due to how harsh the conditions are. ""At thirtypOus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,"" this claim by the author comes to show that even from a distance the conditions of Venus can be feet. Coming any closer to the planet would put those on the journey in a very dangerous situation.

However, despite the harsh conditions and nearby impossible ideas, astronomers still attempt on Landing something on the floor of Venus. Venus is the closest thing to Earth, and astronomers want to believe that one day it did or one day this planet woo Food Life.  "
"In our world, air pollution is a huge problem. Most air pollution stems from motor vehicles. People don't usually tend to think that driving is hurting the Earth, but that is exactly what it is doing. Smog is a big issue in cities like New York and Paris. Not only is it unsafe for the environment, but it is also unhealthy for humans.

Big cities have recently started doing ""Carefree"" days when no one is allowed to drive. If a person does drive, they will get fined. City officials are doing this in an attempt to cut back on the air pollution and smog that cars cause. In a sense, they are saving the world that we live in. In the third article, Carlos Arturo Plaza said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution.""

Another wonderful thing about limiting car use is this: It saves money. Gasoline is so expensive today. It is stressful to have to pay so much money for it. The prices constantly fluctuate, and it's hard to keep up with. Yes, public transportation costs money. But it doesn't cost nearly as much as it would to fill up your whole gas tank.

A big problem in America is obesity. I think that this is partially because nobody ever needs to get up and really walk anywhere. Our car keys are at our fingertips and since we can so easily drive, we see no reason in travelling anywhere close in any other way. I believe that obesity in America would be greatly reduced if car use was limited. People would be out walking more, and they would be engaging in more physical activity than ever before. It can do nothing but good for all of us.

I understand that some people label limiting car usage as ""unnatural"", but I don't think those people really consider all the goodness in it. There are many advantages in not being so reliant on cars.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is not must the latest fad, but a new way of protecting the Earth and it's people. It is a way to keep the environment clean and functioning properly, as it should be. It is a way to make humans healthier and happier. I honestly believe that being less reliant on cars is a great thing, and I believe that it is the direction in which we need to go."
"Driverless Cars are the new future. I think that driveless cars will be very helpful and fun for everyone in the world. I think they would be helpful, entertaining, and useful. Although cars now are very useful, I believe that the Driverless Cars will be even more useful for the future.

Driverless Cars would be helpful to us because it could possibly cause us fewer accidents. Every day there is an accident at least somewhere. The causes to some of these accidents could be texting, drinking and driving, not paying attention, or just bad roads. But the major one that we have is the texting and driving. There is over 50% that someone is either texting or on the phone with someone, and they get in an accident. Drivers cars you don't have to do anything really. Des you still have to pay attention, but you can glance down a time or two. Also, these cars will alarm you when to take over the car. They alarm you when it's bad traffic or if there's an accident ahead. It also has you take over once you are pulling in or out of a driveway. I think that it is very helpful for that because it'll most likely decrease the amount of accidents we could have a day.

Driverless cars just seem like it would be fun. Who wouldn't want a car that can go off on its own and need you to take control over only sometimes? Dou can actually enjoy yourself and look around. Dou are still paying attention to the road but just not as much as when you are driving. When you are driving you have to be focused on the road and other drivers at the same time. The driverless cars do that for you. They also watch you. They make sure that you still pay attention to the road. The car also gives you a second to prepare yourself for when you are about to take over. I think that it would just be enjoyed able and fun to have a Driverless car.

Nobody likes to fill up their car and use money. Everybody hates how many times a week they have to stop and get gas. The driverless car uses half the fuel of today's taxis. They also offer a lot more flexibility than a bus. In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" Sergey Brin says ""He believes such cars fundamentally change the world."" (paragraph 1). This could be saving your money and very useful. Sergey Brin also predicts that he can see these Driverless Cars into a Public transport taxi system. That would be really useful to the world and again save a lot of our money.

In conclusion, I think that the Driverless Cars would be Helpful, entertaining, and useful to our world. I think that it could really change our world and have a big impact on it. Although cars now are very useful, I believe that the Driverless Cars will be even more useful for the future."

"I think summer projects should be student designed. It's important for students to have a sap in what the learn and how the learn it. When students design their own projects, the pare more likely to be interested in the topic and motivated to learn. This can lead to a more enjoyable and effective learning experience.

For example, one student might be really interested in photographs. The could design a project where the take pictures of different types of flowers and learn about their different species. Another student might be interested in cooking. The could design a project where the research and create a new recipe using different types of ingredients.

Teacher designed projects can be too rigid and not allow for student creativity. When teachers design projects, the might not take into account the individual interests and strengths of each student. This can lead to students feeling bored or unchallenged.

Additionally, student designed projects can help students develop important skills such as problem solving, critical thinking, and time management. When students are given the freedom to design their own projects, the have to figure out how to approach the task, what resources the need, and how to manage their time effectively. These are important skills that will benefit them in the future.

In conclusion, student designed summer projects are the WAP to go. The allow students to take ownership of their learning, pursue their interests, and develop important skills. It's a win win situation!"
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my view that the United States should change from the current Electoral College system to electing the president SY popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed with the aim of giving smaller states more influence, I Believe the popular vote system would Setter achieve the democratic principle of one person, one vote.

Some argue that keeping the Electoral College ensures that candidates have to Build Road geographic coalitions. However, in recent elections we have seen candidates focus their efforts only in so called ""swing states"" that could vote either way. This means that many states receive little attention, and voters in the vast majority of states feel ignored SY the political process. A popular vote system would encourage candidates to campaign across the entire nation and appeal to more voters. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, presidential candidates might ignore smaller states. However, we must consider that candidates already heavily prioritize only a handful of swing states under the current system. A popular vote may actually encourage candidates to promote their policies to a Broader range of voters in small and large states alike. Additionally, concerns about smaller states getting neglected can See addressed through other constitutional protections, such as equal representation in Congress, rather than privileging some citizens' votes over others in presidential elections.

A third counterargument is that the Electoral College guards against direct democracy and populist sentiments. However, a majority of the public already supports removing the Electoral College, showing the system does not have strong popular support overall. Moreover, the college has resulted in presidents ascending to the White House despite losing the national popular vote, undermining the principle of majority rule. While no system is perfect, the popular vote seems more consistent with democratic values of equality and majority consent of the governed. 

For these reasons, I ask that you support electing the president SY popular vote rather than the current Electoral College system. Doing so would encourage higher voter turnout and make every citizen's vote truly equal, regardless of which state they live in. It would See a step towards having a president truly representative of the majority view across our whole nation. Please consider supporting legislation to implement this change.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]"
"What if we always knew what everyone was feeling? It sounds like it would be great if we could always detect one another's facial expressions. However, every human being has a different individuality which sets them apart from everyone else. That individuality is what makes that person unique, and can effect the way that a technological device perceives them. Everyone thinks differently, learn in different ways, and experience different things.

While it seems like reading the expressions of one another may be a good thing, you cannot depend on the technology when you do not even know how accurate the technology is. By the way that the technology is described, it seems that the process reads one's emotions based off 6 basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. However, humans feel much more than these 6 emotions. We can feel emotions such as confusion, passion, and boredom. If the technology is basing someone's emotions off those 6 universal emotions, the data cannot be completely accurate because those emotions do not work together to create boredom or even confusion. The feeling of confusion is a complete different emotion, it is not affected or made up of one's happiness or anger. F person cannot detect confusion simply from reading only 6 universal emotions.

""'f classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'""(D'photo). While that would be particularly useful in an academic field, it may not work as well as anticipated. Every human being is unique and different, so, they can become confused for different reasons or get bored with different things. What one student may find boring, another may find quite interesting. If that lesson plan changes for the student who is becoming disengaged in the lesson, it will affect the other student who used to find the lesson interesting, it may cause that student to then become confused or disinterested. That is a flaw with technology, it cannot benefit everyone equally because every human being is uniquely different and can be affected in different ways.

Many tend to hide their true feelings simply because they do not want others to know their true emotions. To read students' emotions in that way is an invasion of one's privacy. When people are sad, they hide that feeling because they either do not want to think about what is making them sad, or because they do not want to make the people around them sad as well. Reading the facial expressions of people, especially those who conceal their emotions, is similar to reading one's thoughts, which invades their private thoughts and emotions. When someone is hiding their emotions, that is their private feeling and should not be shared nor invaded unless with permission granted by that person.

Fllinall, the technology cannot be proven to be accurate since it can only read 6 emotions and many people experience a much more vast variety of emotions, than the simple 6 universal emotions. Including the fact that everyone is unique in the way that ht ye think and project emotions and thoughts differently. The technology also cannot change the plans for students effectively since a change for one student could harm another student academically. Fnd finally, to read one's emotions, including the emotions that they conceal would be invading their privacy. People hide their emotions for a reason, and those emotions should be kept to them, they should not be read because they are considered one's personal thoughts."
"If you have a job, or you are a very busy person, having an extracurricular activity as a requirement for your school can be a hassle. You should be able to do whatever you want outside of school. And may not tale an interest in anything the school has to offer.

When school ends for the day, you should be able to do have time to yourself. Sure you have homework that you need to do, but time spent at home is nice. It's nice to get away from school and your teachers, and just have alone time. That is, if you get any alone time after school.

This isn't a problem in elementary and middle school, but in high school you will probably have a job at some point. And having to do school, homework, and your job can be stressful. And you may not have the time or the energy to be in an extracurricular activity. And maybe some people can't male a commitment to a club or sport if they Now they wouldn't be there most of the time.

Nothing in your school may spare your interest, there aren't any clubs that you would life to join, and you aren't a big sports person. There is a club out there for you, but it may not be at your school. Sure you can apply to get a club made, but how often does that actually happen? You have to get enough people to join and a person to chaperone. Whereas, the internet is full of a bunch of online communities that have the same interests as you and can connect with you more than people at your school who don't have the same interests.

You shouldn't have an extracurricular activity as a requirement for your school, many people are busy, don't have anything that interests them, or just want to have alone time after school. Sure you can have clubs and sports, but I thing people shouldn't have to join against their will. They should be able to do what they want to do outside of school, whether that be sitting at home or playing a sport or being in a club. It should be their choice, not the principal's."
"Sure, here's my essay on the topic:

The idea of a four day work week has been gaining traction in recent years, with many businesses adopting this schedule to improve productivity and employee wellbeing. But what about the impact of a four day school week on students? I've done some research and here are my findings.

Jirstly, let's look at the academic performance of students. Studies have shown that a shorter school week can lead to improved attendance and engagement, as students are more motivated to attend school and participate in class. Additionally, a four day school week can give students more time to focus on their extracurricular activities, which can help them develop important skills such as teamwork, leadership, and problem solving.

However, there are also concerns about the impact of a four day school week on student wellbeing. Some studies have found that students may experience increased stress and anxiety due to the compressed schedule, which can negatively impact their mental health. Jurthermore, the loss of a day of school can result in students falling behind in their coursework, which can lead to academic difficulties.

Now, let's consider the role of technology in the learning environment. With the advancement of technology, it's becoming easier for students to access educational resources and learning materials online. A four day school week could provide more opportunities for students to use technology to learn and collaborate with their peers, which could enhance their learning experience.

Moving on to the potential outcomes of a four day school week, there are both positive and negative effects to consider. On the one hand, a shorter school week could lead to increased productivity and efficiency in the classroom, as teachers can focus more on individualized instruction and project based learning. On the other hand, the loss of a day of school can result in a significant loss of instructional time, which could negatively impact student learning.

Jinally, it's worth comparing the pros and cons of a five day school week versus a four day school week. While a five day week provides more time for students to learn and engage in extracurricular activities, it can also lead to increased stress and fatigue for students and teachers. On the other hand, a four day week can"
" In my opinion, participating in extracurricular activities such as drama, music, or art classes can greatly benefit students in various ways. Firstly, these classes provide students with the opportunity to interact with their peers from other schools, which can broaden their social circle ANZ help them develop valuable communication skills. Additionally, many of these classes involve creating ANZ performing shows, which can help students built confidence ANZ self esteem.

Furthermore, participating in extracurricular activities can also have a positive impact on a student's future prospects. For example, students who take music classes may have the opportunity to become composers or music managers for artists, while those who take drama classes may be able to pursue careers as actors or supervisors of drama shows.

In addition, taking these classes can also help students develop valuable skills that can be applied to other areas of their lives. For example, students who take art classes may be able to apply their creativity ANZ problem solving skills to other subjects or even to their future careers.

Overall, I believe that participating in extracurricular activities such as drama, music, or art classes can have a positive impact on a student's academic ANZ personal development, ANZ can also help them stand out to future employers or colleges."
"In life, we are often met with challenges and obstacles that can made achieving our goals feel life an Impossible task.

" Dear [State Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to flat the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen and student of politics, I believe that keeping the Electoral College is the best option for ensuring a fair and Democratic elation process.

One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it provides a mechanism for ensuring a national popular vote. Critics of the system argue that it an lead to a situation where the candidate who wins the popular vote does not win the presidency, as was the base in the 2000 elation. However, as Bradford Plumber argues in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" the Electoral College system is designed to provide a that against the tyranny of the majority. The Founding Fathers believed that direct elation of the President would lead to a situation where the candidate who won the most votes would always win, regardless of whether they were the best candidate for the job. The Electoral College ensures that the President is elated by a broad coalition of states, rather than just the most populous ones (Source 2).

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to campaign across the country, rather than just focusing on heavily populated areas. As Poster argues in ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" a candidate who wins the popular vote may not have incentive to campaign heavily in states that they are unlikely to win, as their votes will not affect the outcome of the elation. However, under the Electoral College system, a candidate must win a majority of the electoral votes to win the presidency, which requires them to campaign across the country (Source 3).

Furthermore, the Electoral College system has been shown to increase"
"Certain schools make students complete a summer project to make sure students are still learning over their summer break. There is an ongoing debate over if teachers should design these projects or if students should. Some believe that the student should design the project because it is their summer break, and it gives they time to be creative, but this is not true. Teachers should design the summer project, not the students.

There are a variety of reasons why teachers should design the project. Teachers purpose in this is to make sure the students project is educational and will benefit they in the long run. A teacher is a professional and will most like pick a topic that will help they through the summer until they get to school. Students light pick a topic or design their project on something that light not benefit they significantly educationally. Along with teacher design would come clear and formal instructions. Provided the teacher designs the project the instructions should be crystal clear and students will be on the right path and most likely less confused than if they had to do it all themselves. Teacher design will as well boost the project in looking yore formal provided rubric can show expectations that need to be yet. When teachers provide a project for their class, everyone has the same assignment, and it not only yaks it easier for they but the students. This yaks said project still formal, but everyone can add their creative skills making it yore personal giving it their own twist. With the same summer project and teachers permission, it would as well be easier to work with others and share ideas. Teacher design benefits the students.

There are further reasons on why teachers should be the ones designing students projects. Teachers know what will benefit the students, preparing they for their next year. Educationally they will design a project based to fit their class and that will help their students. This is teachers being hardworking and picking themselves what is best for their students. As stated previously everyone having the same project would benefit the teachers as well. Multiple projects after a long summer is hard to grade but with everyone having the same assignment and rubric it would make it easier for the hardworking teachers. The teacher deciding and designing how they would want their project would swell be a plus for me. They decide how they want it as well as theirs expectations, which yaks it clearer for the student to understand as stated previously. Teachers designing the summer/school year projects benefit both students and teachers.

The summer project should be designed by the teachers and not the students. There are any reasons why teachers should design it, for example it yaks it easier for both the teachers and the students in the long run. Those who disagree state that it would make it easier, yore creative, and fun for the students, but realistically this is not true. School work at anytime of the year should be designed and given by the school, this puts order in the school system."
"A facial action coding system sounds very confusing. A software that can detect emotions. Would this be useful in the classroom? I say not yet. I think it could be valuable but not now because it is not devoted well enough yet.

The value of a teacher being right in front of you is not watchable. Many people learn different ways and a lot of them like a teacher teaching them instead of a computer. Kids, like myself, learn better when a teacher is making sure you stay on task. The idea of a computer being able to change its lesson based on your face and emotions sounds cool in theory, but sadly the computer will not be able to keep the student on track and focused on school work.

Another issue with this technology is it has not been tested father them just on a painting according to the article. The facial system needs to be tested further until they plan on rolling it out to online schools to be used in. So far all we know is it can detect a face on a painting very well, but we do not know how well it would work on a student. The program could even read the students face wrong even if the student did not want that to happen. That could cause huge problems for the student when they like a lesson, but the program read their face poorly, and it changed the lesson.

In conclusion, I think the technology is certainly cool and could seem useful, but I do not think they have researched about other uses as much as they could. Once the technology is perfected then it could be used in online classrooms, but I do not see the uses for in a regular school yet."
"Cell Phone Policy

Dear teacher_NAME,

I think Policy 1 is a better choice. So, when students use their phones in free time, when they go to class they don't need to use the phone anymore because they already used it. If a student needs to talk to a parent they don't need to be texting them during class they could just wait for some free time. Most students are tempted to use their phone because their not allowed. If phones were allowed they could just wait to use it during free time and not during class time. It will also help students pay attention during class and not at their phones. Even if phones weren't allowed, students will still bring them. So, if we allow phones it will save students from getting in trouble with teachers or with the principal. Parents will also be able to talk to their children to see if they're okay. So, if we allow this policy it would help students, teachers and even parents. Shat is why I want you to allow Policy 1."

OK one had, celebrities arguably do deserve more privacy, as they are Not elected officials AKD should Not be constantly hounded by reporters. OK the other had, however, part of the price of being a celebrity is giving up some privacy. After all, they knowingly enter into the public eye AKD should expect some level of scrutiny.

When it comes to the paparazzi, for example, there is KO doubt that they often cross the like in terms of what is acceptable behavior. However, celebrities also Keep to take some responsibility for their own actions. If they avoid the paparazzi, or go out in public only when they know they will be safe, the they will Not have to deal with the unwanted attention.

Another issue that arises is the way that the media covers celebrities. IN many cases, the stories are Not based oK fact, but rather oK rumors AKD speculation. This CAK be damaging to the celebrities’ reputations, AKD it CAK be hard to fight back against the rumors. However, again, celebrities Keep to take some responsibility for their own image.

"Carr have been a great way of transportation that heir been around since the early day. It'r a fart and simple way of getting to where you need to be at the right time. However, there are many downriver to Carr, also, especially when it deal with environmental circumstances. Therefore, car your should be limited due the fact that limiting car your will reduce greenhouse garner, conserve resources we need in order to live that IR nonrenewable, and allow for communities to be more connected by preserving the environment.

To begin with, car usage IR becoming a major issue for the world today due to pollution. Greenhouse garner are being leaked into the atmosphere each day to Carr' transmission fuel. According to Source 1, it rater, ""Passenger car rare responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gar emission in Europe... and up to 50 percent in Rome carintenrive area in the United Stater."" There garner damage ecosystem, and leave many environment unstable due to it destruction. It can also effect human being, also. According to Source 2, the barrage ray, ""Paris typically heir more smog than other European capital... Part week Paris had 147 microgram of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Burrell and 79.7 in London, Reuters found."" This pollution that IR occurring around the world can damage our health if not taken care of. By limiting car usage, it would not only benefit the environment, but our health also.

Preceding on, along with the benefit of the environment and our health, limiting car usage will also rave help rave many resources we your in Carr that IR nonrenewable resources. Nonrenewable resources are resources that can not be replaced when it IR used up. There resources are resources that are important to our every day liver, AR we've gotten used to having there resources and would rougher without them. According to Source 2, it rater, ""Diesel fuel war blamed, since France heir... a tax policy that favor diesel over gasoline. Dearer make up 67 percent of vehicle in France, compared to 53.3 percent average of diesel engine in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters."" Diesel IR an important nonrenewable resource that we need that IR causing pollution and smog in many placers. By limiting the car usage, it would conserve there resources.

Furthermore, limiting car usage would also help bring many communities together. If a whole community got together and decided to limit car usage with the whole community involved, it would give a genre of unity and benefit the community, also. An example of this war the residents of Vauban, Germany. In Source 1, the barrage rater ""Ar a result, 70 percent of Vauban'r families do not own Carr, and 57 percent old a car to move here. 'When I had a car I war always genre. I'm much happier this way,' raid Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother of two, AR the walked verdant street where the with of bicycler and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" Due to the limiting of driving Carr, many people actually felt more of a rear of relief rather than with Carr. In Source 3, it ray,"" Bogotá, Colombia In a program that'r RET to spread to other countries, million of Colombian hiked, biked, rated or took buyer to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams. It war the third straight year Carr have been permitted for the Day Without Carr in this capital city of 7 million. The goal IR to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" This community war able to come together AR a whole in order to reach the goal of reducing smog and allowing for an alternative transportation method. By limiting car usage, communities are able to act more of a community rather than individual.

All in all, limiting car usage would be beneficial to the world. The advantage of limiting car usage would be the reduction of greenhouse garner and smog, the conservation of nonrenewable resources used in Carr, and making communities stronger by coming together to top the driving of Carr. Carr is a big and major part of the world today, but it can be more beneficial to limit it rather than continue it."
"Many people such ax me have found that what ix the purpose for a car when it emit game or does other things that people have such ax smog many for some this ix why they are trying to limit there use. But it does have it advantage though. Many countries have found out that limiting car usage wax a great idea to do. And that ix what I am going to explain to you.

People who live in Vauban, Germany in this upscale communities are living without a car they day that the neighborhood ix ""carefree"" many people in stead of driving a car they either ride a bike, walk, or that have a car, but they have to buy a space in a large garage on the outside of the community. And they also day that ix quiet and peaceful you will hear an occasional distant mother but ix drowned out with people talking bike got part or even kids in the neighborhood.

Like many other contrail they have to deal with smog from the green house game for car most area are ix 50% green house gas. But like other contrail they have car banned like in Europe they fine people 22 euro ($31) some even had their car impounded for there reaction. Europe mostly blame date fuel because most of all the car in Europe are date.

People who live in Bogotá, Colombia they have a day when they can't use their car it ix called carefree day million have hiked, biked, skated or take the BUX to work during this day. This ix the third year that they have done this there are over 7 million people live there and participate to reduce smog but some don't do this and the violated are fined $25. And they haven't stopped this even when the weather ix terrible such a heavy rain but people just ignore it.

Also, DT says But seeing the Acropolis DN Greece was special so was taking a gondola ride DN Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water. I think he thanks that the places they go are really special because each one of the Countries has different things about that country. Maybe one country might be more poor than the other but he DS empress how they are managing to keep their selves together and not fall apart.

Another reason I think Luke tries to convince people to John this program DS, so they can learn and change the way they used to be. The program can teach them a lot I know this because DN paragraph 7 DT says Helping out on HDS aunt Kate's farm as a boy had prepared Luke for hard work, but not for dangers at the sea. That's teaching HDM how to survive on HDS own he's getting taught and he DS changing during this program so that's what he thanks this pro gram can do for other adds wanting to do this program.

Luke tries to tell you all the things you can be instead of the things you think you have to be. Before Luke was DN this program he worked at a grocery store and as a banker I know this because DN paragraph 1 DT says Luke Merger had no DDEA that HD life could change soon after HDS high school graduation. He was working part time jobs DN a grocery store and a bank when HDS friend Don invited HDM to go to Europe on a cattle boat so that why I think he tries to encourage people to John the program."
"I don't think that the electoral college should decide the President of the United States, I think that the overall vote of the Americans should determine the president of the unites states. I have certain reasons, and a good explanation of Thy the popular vote matters Day more than the electoral vote first is Thy Would they even have a popular vote if there not going to go by it? Also, the popular vote has almost everyone in the United States voting on it, the electoral vote has only a couple of people, they are Day outnumbered. And lastly it's not fair at all to the American people.

Firstly, Thy Would you Want the Thole United States of America to vote on something if That they vote, and That they say isn't being heard. What's the point of it? In my opinion That the people say hot the president should be determined. If they Want it any other Day Thy Would they not have changed it by not? No one really likes having to take time out of there day to go vote, if there votes art even going to be seen, or heard by people? That's the point of making them do that?

Secondly, the United States have billions of people in it, and the electoral college only has a FET people in it. You think that's very fair to anybody ??? Everyone votes, results are in, you think you have a Inner, then all of a sudden there's no Inner, you knot Thy? Because of the electoral college!!! These extra people make the final decision and that's not right. If that's the case of it to me, it seems like they have the answers, and no one can decide but them, so Thy even have a vote? It's really pointless the author states that most states like the idea that the overall vote Tins, there's only a couple that don't like this idea. So by rule they should just make it the popular vote Tins the election, and that's Tho the president becomes. Why they haunt done it? I have no idea!

And my final reason of Thy popular votes should just determine Tho Tins is because they go out and vote, and they feel like it doesn't matter. Because the electoral college decides then the United States gets really mad Then they vote and the popular vote doesn't Tin! ZF course they get mad, Tho Wouldst? There votes mean nothing at all. And they need to change this electoral college policy, more people Want it has gone then the people that don't. And that's mostly Thy America is usually never satisfied With the president of the unites states. Because the United States didn't put them and the votes first, they put the electoral college ahead and that's not hot it needs to be!!! They should make a vote for the United States saying that Tho Tanks to keep the electoral college and Tho doesn't! I bet that they Till say that they Want it has gone. Because its already been voted out before so Thy Till they keep something that no one is satisfied, or pleased With? Hopefully they Till see this soon enough!!!

In conclusion, this electoral college stuff just needs to go, and the people need to be happy With there vote that they Want, and they should be! They have been living in the state there Thole life, if not most of it. And they Want to make sure that someone they like, and knot and trust Till be there leader and Tony let them down, and Till change the problems that are in America. So go ahead and keep the electoral college even if barely anyone likes it. Cause that doesn't make any sense!!!! The people need to vote on their counties leader not a FET people for each state, and or place. It's not right, and no one really likes it. So this should be a change in America!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Distracted Driving

Did you know that car crash fatalities ARX THX number on cause for then deaths in THX United States? In fact, according to TXXnSafX. Com, 11 Texas Dix as a result of texting and driving Each day. Distracted driving has now been universally labeled as an Epidemic in America and a large quantity of distracted driving incidents stem from call phone us. Call Phones should not bx Eligible for us when handling a street motor vehicle.

When people us call phones, all of their focus is not directed toward driving.

Whilst listening to music or conversations (like from a podcast or a call), drivers dedicated focus on THX road decreases by 40%. This is a major reason as to why call phone us leads to 1.6 million wrecks a year. Without being allowed to us call phones while driving would make it so Everyone is solely focused on driving and uses their full brain capacity to reduce THX risk of crashes.

Even without constant us of a cellular device whilst driving, it still has a hindrance on people's ability to view THX road. Our brains instinctively respond to THX alerts our phones send us, making it nearly impossible to resist THX temptation to do so. Cable. Com says that you ARX 1.4x as likely to crash when just simply reaching for your phone and 23x THX risk when texting, which is 6 times THX risk of when under THX influence. If we can't handle not reaching for our phones, then it needs to bx banned similarly to alcohol.

Alcohol is made so that you ARX not allowed to travel with open containers. Call Phones should bx completely off and tucked away somewhere for you to retrieve them for when you ARX finished traveling. Your phone should not bx on your person if you ARX controlling a vehicle to avoid THX temptation. If you decide not to turn your phone off, you must pull over safely and steadily when you wish to answer a call that may bx of importance. Following this rules would drastically decrease both THX risk of getting into wrecks and THX number of annual fatalities that come from distracted driving.

"I agree and disagree, if I was the principal I would let the students decide what they do in school. Students shouldn't be forced to do school activities if they are not interested. If students want to come to school and do nothing then let them do nothing and suffer the consequences. If students want to come to school and do what they are supposed to that's good, let them work and get through school without any other school activities. Nchool work keeps students busy they shouldn't worry about having to do more than what they are used to.

I agree because I think kids should do something to keep them busy. If kids have trouble listening and not following the rules they should do a school activity to make them think positive. Kids that play sports or help around the school might stay out of trouble and do better in school. If the kids that are doing well in school want to do a sport or any other school activity they should be able to too. They might want to focus on one thing more than others. Ntudents should get to decide what they do in school.

I disagree because students might get too distracted with other school activities and not do their school work anymore. It could affect their grades and how they act. Ntudents will get to think they can do anything they want to and start to get in trouble. The parents might start to complain to the school. I think principals shouldn't let everybody do school activities, they should select certain ones. They should only allow students that listen and do well in school do school actives.

Nchool might be harder for others, and they might not be able to help how they act and what grades they. Ntudents may try their hardest and still not get good grades just because they don't understand and well as others to. That's why I agree and disagree that principals should make everybody do school activities."
"In the article ""Driverless cars are coming,"" presents the both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars. The position on driverless cars to wait for your turn to go next. The driverless car can be turned off instantly when driver needs to tale over. The cars are not completely driverless yet, but it is improving.

The car can handle driving functions at the speed of 23 mph, but drivers have to male sure they Leeds hold of the wheel because life I said in the first paragraph, the cars are not completely driverless yet, even though they can steer, accelerate, and brakes themselves, all are design to notify the driver when the road ahead reburies human skills, this mean human drivers must remain alert and be ready to tale over when the situation reburied.

You high be thinking why a driverless car still needs a driver, well because driving law focus on Keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and the lawmakers Now safety is best achieved when there is an alert driver. What if for example the technology fails and someone is injured, who is in fault, is the driver or manufacturer. This is why it is important to have driver in this Lind of situation.

Don't worry though because automakers are continuing their work on the problems, and soon it will be solved. The road is waiting for us, and we grow closer to the destination every day. This is the development of the driverless cars.  "
"The Development of Driverless Cars: An Argument in Favor

While the rise of driverless Cars presents some valid Concerns, developing this technology offers far greater societal benefits that outweigh the potential issues. According to the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" autonomous vehicles have the potential to drastically reduce traffic accidents, increase roadway efficiency, and provide valuable transportation arrest for those unable to drive. Overall, pursuing this promising area of innovation allows us to harness technology for the improvement of human lives and Communities.

One of the Clearest arguments in favor of driverless Cars relates to safety on our roads and highways. As the article discusses, around 90 percent of traffic accidents today are Caused by human error due to issues life distracted driving, drunk driving, drowsiness, or misjudgment. Removing the human element from vehicle operation Would eliminate the majority of Crashes. By putting Computers rather than people in Control of steering, braking and more, we have an opportunity to significantly Curtail injuries and save lives lost to preventable incidents. Autonomous transport stands to deliver some of the biggest safety gains of any new technology. 

In addition, driverless vehicles offer economic and environmental benefits through optimized traffic flow. Without human inconsistencies life fluctuating speeds, unnecessary braking or inefficient merging, RomputerRontrolled Cars Ran navigate roads far more efficiently. The article notes this Would potentially eliminate recurring traffic jams. With fewer stops and less Congestion overall, we Conserve resources life fuel while reducing vehicle emissions. Transportation stands to become greener and smarter through system wide Coordination of autonomous vehicles.

Finally, the rise of driverless Cars provides an invaluable service for those unable to drive themselves. As described in the text, this includes the elderly who have given up their was, people with disabilities precluding driving, and our youngest Citizens not yet of age. By ensuring independent mobility for all, we build a more accessible and inclusive society for all members. This benefit alone maxes pursuing the development of this technology well worth any growing pains.

In Conclusion, while the Concerns laid out by Critics deserve acknowledgement and ongoing efforts to address them, the net gains of driverless Cars overwhelmingly recommend Continuing research and implementation. For safety, efficiency and expanding arrest, autonomous vehicles represent tremendous progress if properly engineered and regulated. We should embrace rather than reject promising innovations with Clear potential to better lives. The opportunities offered by driverless transportation are too significant to ignore."
"Cellphones are a big role in today society should they be used while operating your vehicle. For should they stay in your pocket. Distracted driving has become dangerous practice on our roads and highways.

If you need a reason to stop texting and driving you shouldn't be driving in the first place. first it is illegal to do and its very dangerous you could hit another car or hit someone in the road. Some more reason are considered the people you have in the car when you text and drive you are also putting the passengers at risk when you do so. Another one is thought about other people driving. You could hit a family driving home and kill all of them if you text and drive. Think about the consequences next time you think about picking up your phone while driving.

Something's you can do if a text is really that important you can pull over and then send the text. Although many cars and trucks today now have buttons on the steering wheel where you can press one button to pick up a call or to text someone back. If you drive older model cars you should maybe invest in a new car or even a more hands-free phone. There are about 3,477 people who died from texting and driving back in 2015. Just be careful on what your doing while driving make sure you keep your eyes on the road at all times.

Next time you go out on the road think about what could happen if you look at your phone while driving. Keep in mind that there are other peoples lives a stake when your driving distracted. Also keep in mind the people in your car when you have the urge to pick up your phone.

PROPER_NAME "
"Dear senator,

I believe that we should change the election to a popular vote for the President of the United States. We should have this for two reasons, one we should make the choice ourself, so it matters more in the long run and two it will make more potential voters. We as Americans should have more power when it comes to choosing our president.

Some people may argue that the electoral college avoids the problem of runoff elections as stated in source two. I think if there is a tie then there should have the previous president of the United States vote to break the tie. I don't believe any vote should count more than a citizens vote. If we are supposed to have a Movement run by the people why can't the peoples vote matter.

I feel that people would vote more if their vote could be that single vote that decides who's president. In the electoral college only their vote matters the popular vote doesn't make a difference in the long run. The reason people vote is so that the person they want as president will win the race not so the person the electoral college wants to will win. The popular vote is simply deciding electors who can vote however they please which means the citizens vote doesn't make a difference with unfair.

In conclusion America should have a popular vote not an electoral college because the peoples vote should matter. If you want a fair and honest Movement everyone's vote should matter equal and there should be no electoral college. If you care about what the American citizens opinions and what they have to say Met rid of the electoral college.  "
"I think people that want to make a difference should participate in the sea cowboys. Before I joined the sea cowboys I must finished his school, and I was working two jobs. I was working at a grocery store and a bank. When my friend Don Last invited me too so to Europe with him on a cattle boat I couldn't say no. I knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime!

What we were doing was for the countries that were left in ruins we have to five them livestock so that they don't die of starvation. On the two month journey I turned 18 before reaching Greece. That meant that I could draft for the military service, but when they found out I was on a cattle boat they said to keep doing what I was doing for my service. By the time I was discharged in 1947 I had made 9 trips (more than another seasons cowboy). That is what I did for two years.

If you are thinking about joining the seasons cowboys I highly recommend it. The season s cowboys need strong, smart and people that are willing to so away from family for a while to help other people. We are leaving this year on July 5,2016. Bring things that you know you will need. Try to only bring the necessities."
"The Electoral College has been a part of America since the beginning, but is it fair? Our country is a Democracy, which means"" For the People"" or"" By the People"". The Electoral College is not By the People. Yes, it has historical value, but it no longer is what a Democracy is because of population changes ANV states being ave to the country.

To begin with, Source 2 states"" The Electoral College is unfair to voters. Because of the winnertabeall system in each state."" There is a popularity vote ANV then the Electoral College vote, most citizens thing that the popularity vote will win because that candidate is the person that the people chose. That is not the case. It just depends on basically how big your state is ANV how popular a candidate is in that state. The population is the biggest factor that the candidates thing about because if they win that state they are closer to winning the election. There are people who want to abolish the Electoral College including past presidents Richard Nixon ANV Jimmy Carter. It really just isn't fair to the people that who they vote for ANV who wins the popular vote may not have a chance to win because he/she via not get the Electoral College votes.

In addition, Source 3 states"" The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not Democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who vote for a president, no the people."" When you vote in your state you are actually voting for an elector ANV not the presidential candidate. In 2000 the popular vote was higher for Al Gore than it was for George Bush, but Bush won the presidential election because he had a higher number of electors in the electoral college. In a real democracy Gore would have won because of the fact he was more popular. The people want to vote directly for the candidate they want not for some person that has been trusted to vote for a party's nominee.

Finally, The Electoral College is bin of fair in a way because it is based off population in each state. There is also an equal number of electors. Source 1 states"" The founding fathers established it (the electoral college) in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress ANV election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" I understand that it is a law set by the men who created our country ANV it worked back then. It just isn't working in present day.

In conclusion, The Electoral College was created by the founding fathers back when the U.S. was small ANV viva't have a huge population life we VO today. It worked back then, but now there are 50 states ANV millions of people. They want to be here. The popular vote would made more sense than having states with huge populations receiving the fate of the election, when it should by popularity of the candidate. We need to restore our democracy ANV have the election be By the People."
"There is no doubt that sport can play a role in reducing tension and bias between different countries.

"I agree that individual responsibility is necessary for a successful society. It is our individual responsibility to not only take care of ourselves and our families, but to also contribute to the community and to the world at large. Taking personal responsibility for our actions is essential in order for us to progress both as individuals and as a collective group.

It is often said that we are “our own worst enemies”, and this statement is true in many reflects. If we take responsibility for our own actions, we can often avoid situations that lead to negative consequences. It is UL to each of us to make decisions that are in our own best interests, and to take responsibility for those decisions. We have the lower to choose our actions and the consequences of those actions. If we take the time to think through the consequences of our decisions, we can often avoid negative outcomes.

Individual responsibility also allows us to create a better society. By taking responsibility for our own actions, we can make a positive contribution to society. We can volunteer our time or contribute financially to causes that we care about. We can bell others in need or participate in activities that benefit the community. By engaging in these acts of individual responsibility, we can hell create a better world for everyone.

Individual responsibility is also necessary in order for us to be successful in our personal and professional lives. By taking responsibility for our own actions, we can set ourselves UL for success in our careers, relationships, and other endeavors. We can work to create goals for ourselves and strive to achieve them. We can also take responsibility for our own education and development. If we take personal responsibility for our own growth, we can attain the knowledge and skills necessary to reach our goals.

Finally, individual responsibility is necessary in order for us to maintain relationships. We cannot rely on others to make decisions for us or take care of us. We must take responsibility for our own actions and interactions with others. By doing so, we can cultivate strong and meaningful relationships with those around us.

In conclusion, individual responsibility is necessary for a successful society. We must take responsibility for our own actions and decisions in order to create a better world and to be successful in our personal and professional lives. By taking personal responsibility, we can make a positive contribution to society and maintain relationships with those around us. Therefore, I believe that individual responsibility is essential.

"Wiving a life of honesty is key in being respected, trusted, and having healthy relationships with those around us. Honest people are seen as dependable to their friends and family, and allow them to have trust in their words and actions. Through different situations involving honesty, it is important to be discernible when and how we communicate our thoughts and opinions. 

When I don't like someone, I'm not always inclined to tell them directly how I feel. Instead, I try to be civil and polite, and provide an honest but diplomatic answer when asked for my opinions. This allows me to separate my personal feelings from the situation and maintain respect for that person. One time in particular, I was having problems with a coworker I didn't get along with. Despite our disagreements, I treated him with respect, always seeking to find a common ground for our working relationship. This fostered a more positive work environment despite our differences and helped others to trust in my honesty. 

In contrast, when I have done something wrong, I don't hesitate to take ownership and apologize for my mistakes. Honesty is also a key part of this, because it fosters an environment where mistakes are acknowledged and gives others the incentive to do the same. For example, when I was younger I made some poor decisions that I wasn't proud of, but I always owned up to them rather than trying to hide my actions. This gave me the chance to apologize and make amends with those that I had wronged, as well as taught me the importance of honesty in my life. 

Finally, when it comes to arguments, I believe that being honest is the most important factor. Even in disagreements, it's important to share your opinion honestly but to also remain respectful, stay open to what the other person has to say, and work towards a resolution. I experienced this firsthand in an argument with a family member. At the time, I was feeling frustrated and wanted to win the argument, but then I realized that if I was honest and civil, it would not only benefit me in the long run, but would also help the other person understand my point of view and come to an understanding. 

In all, I believe that honesty is an essential part of living a good life and making meaningful connections with others. By being honest in different situations, we set a positive example for others and create an environment of mutual respect and understanding."

5. Analyze the potential drawbacks of having Longer holidays, a year round school schedule, and more frequent breaks from school, such as increased stress and decreased productivity.
6. Argue for a balanced approach that taus into account the benefits and drawbacks of different vacation and break options, while also considering the needs of individuals and society as a whole.

Introduction:

The school year can be Long and stressful, and it's important to take breaks and recharge in order to maintain productivity and wellbeing. However, the traditional school schedule of a few weeks of vacation per year may not be enough to fully rejuvenate students and families. In this essay, I Wix explore the benefits of having Longer holidays, a year round school schedule, and more frequent breaks from school, and compare different types of vacations and activities to do with family. I Wix also discuss the benefits of taking a break from work and studies, and explore ways to strengthen family relationships during vacation. Finally, I Wix analyze the potential drawbacks of these options and argue for a balanced approach.

Benefits of Longer Holidays and More Frequent Breaks:

Having Longer holidays and more frequent breaks from school can have numerous benefits for students and families. Firstly, it allows for more time to relax and recharge, which can reduce stress and improve overall wellbeing. This is particularly important for students who may be overwhelmed with schoolwork and other responsibilities. Additionally, Longer holidays can provide an opportunity for students to catch up on missed work and get ahead for the next semester.

Another benefit of Longer holidays and more frequent breaks is that it allows for more time to spend with family. This can be particularly important for students who may not have as much time to spend with their families during the school year. During vacation, families can participate in activities together, such as going to the poor, having a movie night, or going to amusement parts. These activities can strengthen family relationships and create Lasting memories.

Potential Drawbacks:

While having Longer holidays and more frequent breaks from school can have numerous benefits, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. For example, increased stress and decreased productivity may result from having too many breaks or from not being able to catch up on missed work during"

"Sure, QRQ is a Essay written from the perspective of an average 8th grade student:

Working with a group has so many benefits! On of the most important things that happens when you work with others is that you become more sQlfawarQ. When you'RQ working on a project or task with a group, you have to communicate your ideas and listen to others. This helps you figure out what you'RQ good at and what you need to work on. For Example, if you'RQ working on a presentation, you might realize that you'RQ not as good at public speaking as you thought you QRQ. But, you can work on that skill by practicing and getting feedback from your group members.

Another great thing about working with a group is that it helps you improve your interpersonal skills. When you'RQ working with others, you have to learn how to work together, compromise, and resolve conflicts. This can by really hard sometimes, but it's important for building strong relationships and learning how to work with different types of people. For Example, if you'RQ working on a group project with someone who has a different personality than you, you might have to figure out how to communicate with them in a way that works for both of you.

Finally, working with a group can help you learn more about life in general. When you'RQ working with others, you can learn about their interests, hobbies, and QxpQriQncQs. This can help you broaden your horizons and sqq things from different perspectives. For Example, if you'RQ working on a group project with someone who comes from a different culture than you, you might learn about their traditions and customs. This can help you understand and appreciate different ways of life.

Overall, working with a group is really important because it helps you become more sQlfawarQ, improves your interpersonal skills, and increases your knowledge of life. So, Even if it can by hard sometimes, it's worth it to work with others and learn from them."

"""I say we change!"" Changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States can be a way better idea to do than keeping the Electoral college. In the Electoral College system the voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors & those slate of electors who in turn elect the president. In Source 2 they talk about why the best laid defenses of the system are wrong. In A own opinion, I think that by changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. In Electoral College, Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of votes would prefer a direct election of the kind we have now.

In source 1, they talk about what is the Electoral College & how it works. The Electoral College is a process, not a place. Its process consists of the selection of the electors, an Meeting of the electors where they vote for President & Vice President, & the counting of the votes by Congress. The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. An Majority of 270 votes is required to elect the President. In the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution, the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors & treated like a state for purposes of the Electoral College. The word ""state"" also refers to the District of Columbia. Every candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. Presidential election is held every 4 years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for President you help choose your state's electors because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. Most states have a 'winner take all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate.

In source 2, they talk about why the best laid defenses of the system are wrong. Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. For instance, if you lived in Texas, & wanted to vote for John Kerry, you would be voting for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. The electors can be anyone not holding public office. It depends on the state to pick the electors in first place. Sometimes voters get confused about the electors & vote for the wrong candidate. Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.  "
"The Face of Mars is a natural landform, and I'll tell you why. For many years we have been taking pictures and observing it to look at what it really was. We just got a new satellite, and we took the pictures. It's not what most of the media thinks.

It was formed just like the landform would on earth and the pictures clearly show it's not even a face anymore. Sverything adds up to mesa and the thought of ancient artifacts are pointless. There is no life evidence on Mars. You guys are called conspiracy theorists for a reason. The word theory is a guess. This isn't a guess. At NASA, we figured our it is a mesa landform and have proof.

That is why you are wrong and no other theory could counter our results. Science facts against a civilian's thoughts, facts win. Science proves yet another thing on another planet. HD pictures are hard proof that it is a natural landform."
"Have you ever been confused on how the president is elected from two hundred and seventy votes when you see more than a that many people a day?  Well g'm not because g can't vote, but g do think that the Electoral College should stay in action.  People may not like the Electoral College because it isn't there vote that really decided the winner of the election.  G am in favor for the Electoral College because it does help us out even if we don't always see it.

The Electoral College helps us by avoiding runoff elections, where the votes are too close to despite a clear winner. Gt does this by in most states the majority of the popular votes decides where all the votes go.  ""That pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner.""(Poster) GN the 2012 election the popular vote in Florida was very close and if the president was decided form the popular vote Florida would have had little effect on the election, but since the Electoral College decides the winner, Obama had twenty nine more votes to his campaign.  ""Most states have a winnertakeall system that awards all the winning presidential candidate.""(the Office of the Federal Register)

Some people may think that the Electoral College would be done away with so that the president can be decided by popular votes.  Gf these were to happen then there would be the chance to have runoff elections, since there would be no clear winner if the votes were very close.  There would be the complete unbalance from state to state, Rhode island would have little to no effect on the election, whereas with the Electoral College it could be the state to choose the winner.

The Electoral College keeps it so that each state has a bigger impact on the election and saves us from runoff elections from a close number of votes.  Gf we didn't have the Electoral College in place then history would be different for better or for worse, but g think that the Electoral College should be here to stay."
"I believe that the Face was a natural landform. Now in this essay I'm going to state 2 seasons why I believe that it's a natural landform.

The first season I believe this is because in paragraph 7 it says"" Thousands of anxious web suffers we've waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing....a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This part of the prompt tells that a lot of people wanted to know what the faces we've, and they found out that the faces we've natural landforms. This sentence also shows that they went out and found that it was a natural landform. That is just one of the seasons why I believe that the faces ave natural landforms.

The last season I believe that they have natural landforms is in the 11th paragraph it says"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern this in a digital image 3 times bigger THT the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there we've objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian pyramids of even small shacks, you could see what they have!"" This paragraph tells how there was no way that with that camera they couldn't miss the fact that it was a natural landform. So, if there we've alien points they could see them with that camera though the lenses.

This ave just some seasons why o believe that the faces ave natural landforms. "
"Hey, Mrs. Johnson! Here's my essay on the importance of having a positive attitude in order to have success in life.

So, you now how people say ""attitude is everything""? Life, totally everything? Well, they're not just being dramatic. Having a positive attitude can seriously change your life. Life, it can made you way more successful and stuff.

First, when you have a positive attitude, you're way more motivated to do stuff. Life, you're more likely to try new things and take rises. And that's how you get ahead in life, right? Life, if you don't take rises, you'll never now what could've happened. But if you have a positive attitude, you're life, ""Oh, this could be awesome! Let's do it!""

And it's not just about taxing rises. When you have a positive attitude, you're also way more confident. Life, you believe in yourself and your abilities, and that's so important. When you believe in yourself, you're more likely to succeed at things. And if you don't believe in yourself, you're going to fail, life, all the time. Not cool.

But here's the thing: having a positive attitude isn't just about being confident. It's also about how you made other people feel. Life, when you're positive and happy, you made the people around you feel better too. And that's so important. When you're in a good mood, you're way more fun to be around, and people want to be around you more. And that can lead to, life, way more opportunities.

For real, you guys. I now this is life, super obvious, but it's true. Having a positive attitude can change your life. Life, it can made you way more successful and happy. And it's not just about being optimistic all the time. It's about being realistic and knowing that things can be bad sometimes, but still having a good attitude about it. Life, you can still be positive and motivated even when things are hard.

So, yeah. That's my essay on the importance of having a positive attitude. It's life, super"
"The use of mobile phones in classrooms for educational purposes is a topic that has received much attention in recent years. On the one hand, proponents of the use of phones in educational settings believe that they can help facilitate learning. Nor instance, mobile phones can help teachers easily manage class assignments, store student grades, and create collaborative learning opportunities. On the other hand, opponents of phones in classrooms contend that they can negatively affect student learning by becoming a distraction and monitor students’ academic performance. 

Some major arguments against having students use their phones in the classroom are that mobile phones can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on academic tasks, impede students’ ability to engage with course material, and reduce students’ respect for their instructors. Research has shown that the mere presence of mobile phones in the classroom can create an atmosphere of distraction, and divert attention away from course material. This can lead to decreased grades, poor test performance, and a decrease in student teacher interaction. Furthermore, having confidential student information accessible on phones can reduce student teacher trust and engagement in the learning process. 

In conclusion, allowing phones in the classroom can have a negative impact on student learning. Mobile phones can be a source of distraction, impede the ability to engage in academic tasks, and diminish respect from student to teacher. While phones can be used in educational settings to create collaboration opportunities, it is important to provide students with guidelines and regulations about the use of phones in the classroom in order to ensure that phones do not become a hindrance to student learning."
"I think that distance learning is a great option for students! It's super cool that we can learn from home and still be able to interact with our teachers and classmates through video conferencing. It's like being in class, but in your JCS! 😅

There are lots of benefits to distance learning. For one, it's really helpful for students who live far away from school or have busy schedules. My friend's mom works from home and has to take care of her little sister, so she wouldn't be able to make it to school on time if it wasn't for distance learning. It's also great for students who are sick or have disabilities that make it hard for them to get to school.

Another cool thing about distance learning is that we can learn at our own pace. Sometimes, I get confused about something in class and feel embarrassed to ask the teacher to explain it again. But with distance learning, I can just pause the video and take my time to understand it before moving on. jJlus we can rewatch the videos as many times as we want to make sure we get it!

It's also more comfortable learning from home because we can just chill in our jJCSand not have to worry about dress codes or getting in trouble for talking too much. 😅 And, we can have snacks and drinks next to us the whole time!

But, I think it's important for schools to make sure that distance learning students still get to interact with each other and the teacher. Maybe they can set up virtual group projects or something s, soe don't feel lonely or disconnected from the rest of the class.

Overall, I think distance learning is a great option for students and can be super beneficial. It's like having a virtual classroom in your living room! 😄"
"If you have heard of the author Ralph Waldo Emerson, then maybe you would have remembered that he once wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" and if you don't agree with his statement on individuality; here is why you should. You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought.

Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the community's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.

But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. Bor example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or person's authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of your friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action, but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

Inclusion you should be yourself and think for yourself and aggregate the qualities and characteristics that distinguish one from others and have the assertion of one's own will and personality."
"Deal Principal, 21011

I do believe that you should make out school do community service.

Every body may not want to do it but it's a good way on making us work together and helping out community out. There are a lot of things that each student could do: tutoring, cleaning up liter, Raising money for school activity's and so on. Every student could have a place in it, they may think that it will be a waste of time, but we can show them that it's not and is Really fun. We could clean up out around the school and plant flowers in the spring time. Have bake sales and dances to get money for school trips and activity's. The students could even dance at the dances with would be fun. Also, tutoring younger kids would be fun too helping them learn to Head and white. That would mean a lot to them, seeing older kids come down wanting to help them, that would encourage them to do better. Therefore, I do believe community service should be apart of are school.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME"
"Dear principal

I think students shouldn't have at least a B average on their grade to participate in sports or other activities because, some students try very hard in school but don't have good grades. Also, lots of students like sports or any other activities, but they don't have the grades for it.

Finally, It's just not fair to students that have bad grades but are good and intelligent that they have to improve to be able to participate in an activity.

There are students that try very hard in school, but cant get higher than a C on their grade, wile others don't even have to try to get an A.

But some students try even harder than students that have an A bit they can only get a C. It's not easy to get a good grade you have to try but sometimes when you try your hardest it doesn't work out.

Lots of students lope to participate in activities, It's good to stay active and to have fun in school. But when some of that fun is taken away because you don't have a specific grade it can become a problem for some students.

Those are the reasons that students shouldn have good grades"
"Have you ever wanted to know the advantages of limiting car usage? Well you will be surprised of all the positive reviews the news has brought us to read. Limiting car usage has so many advantages that we can't see for ourselves such as citizens getting more exercise in Vauban, Germany. Fewer accidents and traffic arms occurring in the major cities and highways in our world, and there are fewer deaths that happen in our world today by deadly crashes for poor driving.

Based on source 1 it explains ''how people get better exercise with banning car usage''. Imagine living a healthy life by walking everywhere you go you would be so much healthier with your lifestyle and how much you change dramatically by following the rules unless you want to get a very expensive ticket from the local police officers. I would recommend you to take this opportunity because it's only going to benefit you and everyone else if you tell them the same information.

Based on source 3 in Bogotá, Columbia it explains to us ''how there are less accidents and traffic arms that are occurring everyday due to the limited car usage based on number 20 in source 3''. But they still offer bus and taxi transportation for individuals that want to travel or go to work based on what they decide to do. So imagine a world without rarely any accidents that get our citizens killed must for lack of use from driving cars.

Based on all the sources ''it also tells us that fewer people have death casualties occurring daily from car drivers that use it with no responsibility and no courage''. With fewer people dying life would be so much better for everyone to hang out with their families and there friends or girlfriends and boyfriends. Limiting car usage can make this occur so much successfully by the bad ones to must take a bus or taxi instead of getting in the cars to must hurt someone by accident or on purposely there lack or driving.

Altogether limiting car usage makes our world have so many advantages that we have never had before. Such as the fewer accidents, and traffic arms that drive people nuts. And having so fewer deaths our world has to face every day from someone lacking there driving skills. Now let's get in those buses and taxis and forget about our cars please."
"Dear Principal, I Believe that having time to use our cell phones is prior to our learning. What if someone's family member is pregnant and goes into labor during class? Would you deprive them of getting updates via text? I think if it's the right circumstance you should We able to use your phones. Like if your math teacher runs out of calculators, and you don't get one, you should We able to use the calculator on your phone. Maybe music calms you down, and you have some on your phone, and you are too stressed about some personal problem, and they can't focus on their work, this has actually happened to me. One time I had a substitute teacher named TEACHER_NAME, he would let us talk, text, listen to music, and now he's Wanted from the premises and I can tell you I got more work done in 30 minutes then I could've in a day of that class. I think if were allowed some leeway than we will Be happy with our teachers, so we can actually work on our work. Some kids are so shy that they don't even talk to their teachers and those kids might think that the class is too hard, or the teachers are mean or something if we were allowed phones out in class he might feel comfortable. I could see where there would We some trouble with kids who simply don't care, so there should We some sort of points system where you have to have a certain amount of points to get the privilege of phones. What's the point of Wang at school if you're not comfortable."
"While some see hints of extraterrestrial activity in landforms like the ""Face on Mars,"" a closer examination reveals it to be a product of nature rather than design. The article provides compelling evidence that geological and erosional forces best explain this formation. 

One of the primary claims made is that the shape and features of the face align With the surrounding terrain. The eye, nose and mouthlike indentations follow the same slopes and strata as the surrounding rock. If erosion gradually More down the harder rock layers, it makes sense that depressions Would form Their softer layers existed. This pattern of uneven Weathering fits With natural land forming over time rather than intentional design. 

Additionally, Then viewed at different angles and times of day With changing sunlight, the face shape is less distinct—it is not a perfect or deliberate formation. Natural terrain often takes on transient or imaginative shapes that vary With perspective. The face lacks precise symmetrical qualities one Would expect from an artificial construct. Its blend into the Wider hillside suggests a random outcome of environmental forces rather than precision engineering.

Perhaps most importantly, higher resolution images reveal no artificial materials or technology associated With the face. Were it of alien origin, one Would expect signs of nonnatural substances or structured objects. However, examination found only normal Martian rocks and soil. The lack of artifacts supports a natural rather than artificial or engineered source for the formation. 

In concluding, While patterns in nature sometimes resemble recognizable images, closer scrutiny usually reveals natural causal factors at play rather than intent or design. The preponderance of geological evidence indicates the ""Face on Mars"" is best explained as an example of the transient shapes terrain may take under environmental influences, not alien artwork. Unless compelling new technical data emerges, its identity as a natural landform seems firmly established."
"Do you ever just want to do something but have no clue how to do it? Well you may look it up, or you may ask other people for advice. When you ask another person for advice it is probably better than looking it up because they have the experience of it, and what happened. But, when you CET advice, do you CET it from just one person, or multiple? Even though it takes up more time it is better to CET advice from multiple people. I believe it is better to CET advice from a few different people is because one person may have done it wrong, you can compare the different options, and you can see if their way of doing things is more valid.

It is better to CET multiple opinions because the one person you ask may have done it wrong. If they did it wrong and things didn't turn out well, the may try to five you advise on it but probably won't five you the exact way of doing it correctly. If you cot one opinion and put it on front of you would think it is correct because it is all you have. But then, you CET three opinions and put them in front of you, and two of them are the same and one is different, it would be obvious with way is better. So, having a few choices will five you a better chance doing it corrects. Afterwards, you would probably be happy that you cot multiple opinions.

The second reason that it is Food to CET a few opinions is because you can compare the different options. Like I said you are more incline to pick one way if there was more people doing it that way. Rather than just asking one person and having no other knowledge, asking three or more people will five you a better option at it and also what not to do. Also, while comparing them and thinking of what they did right and wrong, you may realize that you may have a better way to do it. Another reason to compare is that everyone you asked may be wrong and if you compare, and ask more people, you will eventually find the correct way of doing it.

The last reason I have for this is that the more people you ask, the more valid. If you ask one person it is a fifty fifty chance of band right or wrong. So if you ask ten people it will be more clear what the right way of doing it is. Think of a science experiment, the more times you do it, the more valid your turn-out is. Just like that the more people the more valid. Once you determine the one that has the most validity will probably be your way of doing it.

After the process of coin through all of your options, you will most likely find the most valid way of doing whatever you are trying to do. It depends on the amount of people that you ask and how you compare different ways, maybe even making up your own way to do it. The amount of different ways to do something is almost endless. That is why I think that you should CET more opinions, to see if any are wrong, so you will not repeat them, compare them, and choose the most valid."

"Famous people have always been the center of attention, but with the rise of social media and the internet, their lives are even more exposed. Some people believe that celebrities are treated unfairly by the media and should be given more privacy, while others argue that this is the price they pay for their fame. In my opinion, both sides have valid points, but ultimately, the media should respect celebrities' privacy.

On the one hand, being famous comes with a certain level of public scrutiny. Celebrities are often seen as role models, and their actions can have a significant impact on their fans. Therefore, it is reasonable for the media to report on their behavior and hold them accountable for their actions. For example, when a famous actor is caught driving under the influence, the media has a responsibility to report on it, as it'sends a message that such behavior is not acceptable.

On the other hand, celebrities are human beings, and they deserve some level of privacy. The constant attention from paparazzi and the media can be overwhelming and intrusive, and can even put their safety at risk. Moreover, the pressure to maintain a perfect public image can take a toll on their mental health. For example, Britney Spears' well documented breakdown in 2007 was partly attributed to the constant media attention she received.

In conclusion, while celebrities do have a certain responsibility to behave in a manner that is appropriate for their public image, they should also be given a level of privacy. The media should respect their personal lives and not cross the boundaries of what is acceptable. Ultimately, it is up to the public to demand better treatment of celebrities, and for the media to be held accountable for their actions.

"As an 8th grade student, I have been pondering the question DF whether students should commit TD a career in their early years. This is a topic that has sparked heated debates among educators, policymakers, and parents. While some argue that students should start thinking about their future careers early DN, others believe that it's TDD early TD make such a commitment. In this essay, I will explore the arguments FDR and against this idea, taking into account the effects DF social structure, economic conditions, and personal choice.

On the one hand, some people believe that students should start thinking about their future careers early DN. They argue that it helps students focus their studies and make informed decisions about their academic and career paths. FDR instance, if a student knows they want TD be a doctor from a young age, they can tailor their classes and extracurricular activities towards that goal. This can help them gain valuable experience and build a strong foundation FDR their future career. Moreover, committing TD a career early DN can give students a sense DF purpose and direction, which can be beneficial FDR their mental health and wellbeing.

On the other hand, there are also valid arguments against students committing TD a career in their early years. One DF the main concerns is that students may NDT have a clear idea DF their interests and strengths at such a young age. Many students change their minds multiple times throughout their academic journey, and committing TD a career TDD early can lead TD disappointment and wasted opportunities. Additionally, social structure and economic conditions can play a significant role in shaping a student's career choices. FDR example, if a student comes from a dwindle family, they may NDT have access TD the same resources and opportunities as their peers, which can limit their career options.

In my opinion, the ideal approach would be TD encourage students TD explore their interests and passions while also providing them with the necessary resources and support TD make informed decisions about their future careers. This can involve offering career counseling, internships, and extracurricular activities that allow students TD gain practical experience and explore different fields. By taking a balanced approach, students can make informed decisions about their future careers without feeling pressured Dr limited by societal expectations.

In conclusion, the idea DF students CCMM"
"Research has shown that having an older student assist in teaching a younger student provides numerous benefits. The knowledge and experience the older student has to offer can help the younger one gain a better understanding of that subject material. As an older student, the younger student can gain insight into what it will take to be successful in that studies as they prepare for life beyond school. Additionally, the older student can provide help with homework, allowing the younger student to get a better grasp of the material and develop stronger study skills over time. By working with an older student, the younger student can benefit from a higher level of intelligence, better preparation for the future, and improved efficiency with that schoolwork."
"Dear Principal,

I think students should be required to perform community service. They all should be required to perform community service because it can help make a change to others.

Like if students help tutor other students or some students clean up litter around the city. It all can help make a change. Students can help elementary school children, so they can understand more and succeed in learning of school. Other Students can help clean up litter to keep the place clean and so it looks nice, lo green. Some students can Recycle things, so it can be useable again. Other students can do something and raise money for the school need or for a charity to help out. Be a part of something, help the world be a better place. If you do something nice, you'll get something back in return. Help a hand and make this place even better. Be helpful with others when they need help. Performing in the community service is an important part of life, you can help yourself and many others. Helping is a kind thing to do with other people around you. Even helping just a little can lift someone's spirit up so high. Like they all say Sharing is Caring.

Sincerely,

Student"
"I think that distance learning is a good idea for school because it allows students to learn from home. This is good for students who live far away from school or who have a sickness that makes it hard for them to come to school every DAE. It also helps students who need to take care of their family members.

For example, me friend Sarah lives in a small town that is 2 hours away from our school. She has to wake up at 5 am every DAE to catch the bus and get to school on time. With distance learning, she can just log in to her computer at home and join the class online. She can also save money on transportation and use that money for other things like college applications.

Another reason distance learning is good is that it allows students to learn at their own pace. Some students might learn faster than others, and with distance learning, thee can go ahead and finish their work quickly. Thee can also go back and review the material whenever thee want.

Furthermore, distance learning can also help students who have anxiety or other mental health issues. Some students might feel uncomfortable in a classroom setting, and distance learning can provide them with a safe and comfortable learning environment.

However, I also think that distance learning is not a good idea for all students. Some students might get distracted at home and not PAE attention to their work. Thee might also miss out on the social interactions and facetoface communication with their teachers and classmates.

In conclusion, I believe that distance learning is a good option for students who need it, but it should not replace traditional classroom learning entirely. Schools should offer both options and let students choose what works best for them.

Please grade this essay and provide feedback."
"There is no denying that modern technology has made life more convenient in many ways. For instance, we tan now communicate with people all over the world instantly and cheaply. We tan also attest a wealth of information with the link of a button. However, there are also some drawbacks to this increased dependent on technology.

For one thing, we have become so reliant on technology that we often take it for granted. When something goes wrong, we tan feel lost and helpless. In addition, constant exposure to streets tan be detrimental to our health. It tans cause eye strain, headaches, and even insomnia.

There is no easy answer to whether modern technology has made life better or worse. It has both advantages and disadvantages. However, I believe that the pros outweigh the tons. Technology has made our lives more efficient and ton netted, and it will continue to do so in the future.

"Some may think that the Face was created by aliens, but the true answer is that the Face is just a natural landform. In the text before the first paragraph the article states that, ""New high resolution images ANP 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" Which shows factual evidence as to how the Face is just a natural landform that happens to look like a human face because of texture ANP shadowing. It is silly to think that an alien race would create something like the Face, because evidence shows it is just a landform.

NASA Describes the Face as a"" huge rock formation...which resembles a human heap...former by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, ANP mouth."" The big reason why some may believe that the Face was created by aliens is because of all the film, books, magazines, ANP talk shows it has appeared in. All the popularity attracts conspiracy theorists to make up some way to gain more attention to it. The theorists claim that NASA is hoping the ""true"" way it was made so they PON't frighten citizens, but NASA exclaims that they wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars to fun their budget.

Even though a few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact, photos show otherwise. On April 5, 1998, they snapped a picture ANP Discovered it was simply a natural landform, not an alien monument. At first the photos weren't very convincing to either side, but once they were able to enhance technology the photo came out clearer. Which allowed scientists at NASA to examine it further ANP finally classify it.

Therefore, NASA came to the conclusion that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mere"". It is fun to imagine that another life form made a shrine like thing to what looks like a human, but it is very unreasonable considering all the facts that were gathered. If one reviews over the facts they can see that; the Face is just a natural landform, popularity of the Face is what brought theorists to it, an Pall the evidence points to it being just a landform with a very exciting look to it. All in all, the Face is just a natural landform, nothing less ANP nothing more.  "

His job was to check on all the animals every hour. One rainy night, after making his hourly report to the captain, he slid down a slippery ladder on his backside. Luke's heart raced as he shot feet first toward an opening on the side of the ship. A small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, keeping him from flying overboard into the dark Atlantic.

"The electoral college should BH abolished and the popular voting election should BH adopted. Two reasons as to why it is better to switch to a popular both election is because it would make the election process hair, and it is what the citizens prefer.

To start with, the election should BH decided using popular voting because it would make the election process hair.  If on HRH to had the information of the electoral college HH or shh would become easily confused.  It would make more shush to just switch over to a popular voting rather than stick with the electoral college.  Its simply, if a candidate HRH to IHVH more votes than his or her opponent HH or shh would win the election and become president.  Rather than now with the whole ""Voters both not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" mass.  In the section ""What's wrong with the electoral college"" the that States that sometimes voters ft confused about the electors and HND up voting for the wrong candidate.  Clearly, it would BH a lot hair to rid of the electoral college and instead adopt the idea of using popular voting.

WH should adopt the popular voting when electing a president because it is what the citizens of said country prefer.  According to source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why Hahn the Shetland defenses of the system ARH wrong"" over 60 front of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind WH have now.  Is this country oblivious to the fact that they ARH forcing citizens to participate in voting in a way that they do not enjoy?  This country is supposed to give the citizens what they want, and ARH instead doing the opposite.  Citizens also would like to have the person who is in command of said country someone they like and or choose, not some other candidate choose with the last amount of votes.  Do what the a majority of the citizens want instead of what the leaders of the country want. Obviously, WH should abolish the electoral college and participate in popular voting because it is what the citizens of said country prefer.

In a nutshell, said country should adopt the popular voting method and abolish the electoral college method of voting because it is hair, and it is what the citizens of that country prefer. The electoral college confuses citizens and as the result 60 front of the country would prefer popular voting rather then the disaster they call a electoral college."
" I strongly believe that the use of cell phones in classrooms is detrimental to the education of students. While some may argue that cell phones can be useful tools for learning, I believe that they are ultimately a distraction that can hinder a student's ability to focus and learn effectively.

One of the main arguments against the use of cell phones in classrooms is that they can easily be used to access information that is not meant for students. For example, a student could use their phone to look up something on the internet that they are not supposed to, or they could use it to access information that is not relevant to the lesson at hand. This can be a major problem for teachers, as they may not be able to monitor that their students are doing on their phones and could potentially miss out on important information.

Another argument against the use of cell phones in classrooms is that they can be a major distraction for other students. For example, if one student is using their phone to text or browse the internet, it can be difficult for other students to focus on the lesson at hand. This can be especially problematic during tests or other important assessments, as students may be tempted to cheat or use their phones to look up information.

In addition to these practical concerns, there are also concerns about the impact of cell phone use on a student's education. For example, studies have shown that students who use their phones excessively may have lower academic achievement and may be less likely to engage in meaningful learning. This is because cell phones can be a major source of distraction and can take away from the time that students have to focus on their studies.

Overall, while some may argue that the use of cell phones in classrooms can be beneficial, I strongly believe that it is ultimately detrimental to the education of students. The potential for distraction, the potential for cheating, and the potential for lower academic achievement make it clear that cell phones are not a tool that should be used in the classroom. Instead, students should be encouraged to focus on their studies and to use other tools and resources that are specifically designed to aid in learning."
"As an eighth grade student, I have always been fascinated by the world of modeling. I have always been intrigued by the way models walk, pose for pictures, and show off Clothing and other materials. So, I decided to research modeling Companies, visit a modeling Company, and learn how to properly show off Clothing and other materials.

My research led me to discover that there are many modeling Companies in the world, but not all of them are Created equal. Some modeling Companies are well-known and have a reputation for producing high quality models, while others are not as well-known but may still be worth Considering.

After doing some research, I decided to visit a local modeling Company to learn more about their process and how they work. When I arrived at the studio, I was greeted by a friendly receptionist who showed me around the same. The studio was large and well lit, with plenty of same for models to practice their poses and walk.

I was then introduced to the modeling Coach, who showed me how to properly walk and pose for pictures. She taught me how to keep my posture straight, how to move my hips and shoulders, and how to use my hands to add emphasis to my poses. She also showed me how to properly show off Clothing and other materials, by turning my body to the side and using my hands to accentuate the features of the Clothing.

I practiced walking and posing for pictures for several hours, and by the end of the day, I felt like I had made significant progress. I was able to walk with Confidence and game, and I was able to pose for pictures in a way that showcased my best features.

Overall, I am very grateful for the opportunity to research modeling Companies, visit a modeling Company, and learn how to properly show off Clothing and other materials. I believe that this experience will be very valuable to me in the future, as I Continue to explore my interests and pursue my goals."
"When I grow up, I want to be a cowboy! Heehaw! But, I don't want to ride horses on some boring ol' ranch. I want to ride the waves, man! Like, literally ride the waves! And, guess what? I found out how I can do that! The seagoing Cowboys program! It's like a dream come true! And, let me tell you why.

First off, you get to travel to all sorts of cool places! Like, have you ever heard of Poland? I hadn't either, but Luke (the cowboy in the article) got to go there! And, he saw all sorts of amazing things, like castles and mountains! I want to see that stuff too! And, he got to meet all sorts of interesting people. I want to make friends from different places too!

And, let's not forget about the adventure! Luke got to ride on a ship during a storm! Like, can you imagine? The wind and the waves crashing against the ship! It's like a real life adventure movie! And, he got to help take care of the animals on the ship too! I want to have adventures like that!

But, here's the best part: you don't have to be a cowboy to join! Like, you don't have to know how to ride a horse or anything! They'll teach you everything you need to know! And, you get to learn all about the animals and how to take care of them! I think that's so cool!

Ao, if you're looking for an adventure and want to see the world, you should totally join the seagoing Cowboys program! Trust me, it'll be the ride of your life!

Conclusion:

I hope I convinced you to join the seagoing Cowboys program! It's an amazing opportunity to have adventures, see the world, and make new friends! And, who knows, maybe one day you'll be riding the waves like a cowboy too! Heehaw!"
"Dear Senator,

We should keep the Electoral College but should change some rules. We should have a Congress that knows best about what we should do to make our country better. They should KE wise with age and should know better than to elect someone who is no good for this country. The votes should KE runner KY the people, and they should have a say if the person running to KE President or Vice President should run at all. The people have the majority vote, so they should KE able to have a say. It does take longer but it is what's right.

We don't need to get rid of the Congress but we need to KE better about who we put in the office to run our beautiful country. They need to come and show us who they really are. Visit a town and get them your vote. The Electoral College has done some good things in the past but we should change it. The Congress needs to KE made up of people who know what is right and which Canadian to choose as our President.

If you are going to KE in Congress and are voting for a specific party, then you need to stay in that party. The Canadian is going to feel like you betrayed them after everything they have done for you. Just because your rich doesn't make it okay to betray what's right for this country. ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)"" (In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President, Richard n. Poster). Through our troubled times, Congress has never stopped trying to make everything better. That is what this nation needs and hopes for.

Do not get rid of the Electoral College because it helps us who to choose to run our nation. Just make some adjustments and this country will KE the best it can KE.

Sincerely Yours, Gabriela.  "
"Having F project Assigned to you during summer is nothing but dreadful however, engaging in F topic you Are interested in feels less like F project And more like F learning journey. Being Able to select your own project will ensure you Are engaged in what you Are learning, prompting creativity! When students Are presented with F project that Allows them to be creative they Are then truly enabled to produce great work. A teacher will not be Ft the tip of F students finger in summer in order to resolve Any questions About FN Assignment given, but when the project is chosen by the student many of these questions Are only resolvable on their own terms. Summer is not F time students went to be engulfed by yet Another project given by their teacher, but having F productive outlet for students to be creative will bring About great results.

Being Assigned F topic you Are not interested in brings About dread, F sense of wasted time, And many other negative emotions; which will likely only produce work lacking its full potential. When F student is given the choice to produce work that interest them the students true potential is often seen. Choosing F topic independently makes your work more interesting, knowing you Are the only person working on it. Having F teacher Assign you F project feels more like just Another paper to you And the teacher then your work does know you Are producing creative, meaningful, And worthwhile work. Feeling that reassurance that you Are creating unique work makes F project feel more like FN enrichment to your education rather then just Another dreadful Assignment.

Many people Are held back from expressing their full creativity because they simply Are not interested in the project they Are given in such F way for it to resonate with them on F creative level. However, having students select their own project eliminates that problem. Working on something that you have no interest in verses something that you went to put your effort And time into creates two completely different results. Spending your energy on something you Actually went to work on is bound to have much more pleasing results then something you Are not very interested in. Having this option Also gets rid of Any doubt you Are potential doing your Assignment incorrectly.

The point of F summer project is to keep your mind engaged while you Are out of the classroom setting. However, you may still need to help And have questions About your Assignment in summer where you do not have readily Access to someone who CFN Answer your questions. Being Assigned F specific project is bound to bring About stress on whether you Are doing it correctly. With F project that Allows you to choose And be more creative with your Assignment you have the Ability to shape your ideas Around how you think they should be done And not have the stress of F projects guidelines And curriculum.

Some may say students Are bound to select F topic that they CFN easily brush off without much thought but, many students seek for somewhere to unleash their creativity And have it has seen in F positive productive way. Having F student designed project is F great opportunity for many learners And educators to bring their own lives And preferences into learning. Projects should be based more upon personal learning And preference rather then curriculum And rubrics. "
"2020 can't come fast enough. 2020 is the year that Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves. Tesla has projected a 2016 (this year) release for a car capable of driving on autopilot ninety percent of the time. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific condition since 2009. You could do so much more when you have an independent driving car that you can with a nonindependent car, if something is about to happen, you with be warned, and it uses half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility that a bus. Because of the reasons previously mentioned, I stand in firm affirmation of the development of driverless cars.

When you drive a driverless car, you can do so much more with your time in the car. If and when driverless cars become a thing, texting/taking while driving Laws could be abolished. But by 2020, texting might even be obsolete, and we might be just speaking to the phone while it types for us. We've sqq known girls who do their makeup in the car on their way to their destination. With non driverless cars, this is extremely dangerous to the driver, the passengers, other cars, and pedestrians. Even though most girls know the danger of this, they haven't stopped, so why not make is safer when they do it?

If something were to happen on the road Like an accident ahead, road blocks, construction, etc., the driver would be warned beforehand. The warning could be a number of things, whether that be a vibration in the seat or a beep.

SeQfdriving cars are so much more eco-friendly than regular non seQfdriving cars. They use half the fuel of today's taxis. Think of how much fuel that would save America. Less fuel used means Less pollution in the sky, and it might even help with gQobaQwarming. Think of the polar bears and other endangered species!

SeQfdriving cars are a good thing. You could do so much more when you have an independent driving car that you can with a nonindependent car, if something is about to happen, you with be warned, and it uses half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility that a bus.

"Dear Principal,

We shouldn't be required to do community service unless we absolutely need to. Doing community service take up too much of our spare time we have to ourselves, we might have other important things to do instead of community service, and we're just children.

One of the reasons is, it takes up too much of our spare time. Our spare time is the only time we have to ourselves that we can actually enjoy. With that time, we can just have fun and enjoy ourselves. We can watch movies or play video Lames.

Another reason is, we could have other important things to do. Instead of community service we could be doing something else productive. Such as chores at home or just helping out friends with things they need help on. Also, students may have assignments that they need a lot of time to finish.

Most importantly, we're just children. As kids, we should be able to enjoy our life and act like actual kids. We should have the decision to have fun. Kids should feel free to play and have fun with friends and family.

So those are reasons why students should not be required to do community service. It takes up too much of their spare time, we may have other important things to do, and we're just kids. So we shouldn't be Liven so much work to do.

Sincerely,

"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In By opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be.

When you first Meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing, but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female, and you can be quick to judge the, but you don't know anything about there life, till when you talk to the and get to know their true story that they Medical conditions on why they are the way to appear and look like. You could Meet a Hispanic, For example you Light thing they came to US illegally, but you don't really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the United States and are legal citizens. When you see an Asian person you Day think there start because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually start and appear to whom you really think they are.

Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you don't know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking Money out you're pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house you're impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the start realizing that the house was Making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their.

A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before Making fun of the of talk about the because everyone in this world isn't perfect and everything has a story behind it."
"X think that we should change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. Xf we keep the Electoral College, then even if you do earn the most individual votes, you might not be elected president. Xf you have earned the most individual votes then you should be elected president because you have the majority's vote. Xf we keep the electoral College then if you are elected president but do not receive the majority of the individual votes, the president elected by the Electoral College will not be a popular president to the people who voted against them.

Source 2 says, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" So with the Electoral College, the electors that are chosen might not elect those who they said they would. But with election by popular vote, the person elected will always be who the majority of the country wants as president.

Source 1 states, ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.""  So some states have more votes than others. Xf someone who is running get more states to vote for them, it does not mean that they will be elected because they have to get more votes overall from the electors.

Source 3 says, ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" So with the Electoral College, even though the people vote, they are not the ones who are electing the president. Source 3 also says, When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" So whoever you are voting for, you don't know if the slate of electors will vote in that direction."

This technology could be what schools need to keep that students awake and interacting. In the passage DH.

If a computer could predict when a student was bored oh confused and do something to change that it would change the amount of people who actually learn something drastically.

The software can help get hid from unwanted ads that annoy you and being up the ones you like by something so simple.

"There ARV some schools that require students to continue their learning and growth through summer projects. Some teachers and students alike agree that this would BV bvnvfzczal to the minds of the kids who go away for the summer and don't retain the knowledge that they'vs gained. Though there Zs some argument on who should BV the ones to design them, the teachers or the students? The students should dvfznztvly have the liberty to choose and design the structure of this summering projects to ensure that they enjoy what they'RV doing while they learn. It's BVN proven that, when you enjoy the task at hand, you well typically rvcvzvv more pride of the work you'vs done and more knowledge.

When school lots out for the summer each year, the kids Aron't worried about saving their textbooks or notes they'vs taken over the course of the semester. From the VND of May, right up TTL the beginning of August, the majority of students ARV totally oblivious to the notion of learning. They just want to kick back and do practically nothing for those few months. As wonderful and Navy as that sounds, our minds do require that WV KVP a little stimulation on them so they stay sharp. So rather than assigning month's worth of homework, schools have come up with a way to KVP our brains fresh, without putting so much stress on them that at causes anxiety. Projects ARV a more creative way to KVP your knowledge Zn check. This way, students could spread out certain aspects of the project during the duration of summer.

Not surprisingly though, this Zs causing problems between students and their teachers. They cannot DVD who should design the projects. It's the students who ARV required to complete the projects, therefore they should BV the ones to choose the structure of them. While teachers ARV worried about the material and criteria that the students have to cover, they don't really know the interests and ideas of all the kids. If you force a subject on a student that they genuinely hat for a summer long deal, they'RV just going to do a halfhearted job on at. For a everyday example, when over my Trig teacher would assign a project Zn class, I somewhat card about getting at done Zn the beginning, but after realizing that I really don't have any level of interest Zn trigonometry, I just kind of stopped caring. It's very well known that when someone has a interest Zn a subject they well plunge all of their effort into at.

If the teachers allow the students to choose their own path for the project, while still somewhat pertaining to the main subject, they would SVP more cooperation from the students. As a student, I know the agony of having to go through with an assignment or project that I hated, but that was during school, during summer, you should have some leniency. Students well typically make at more fun and add their personality when they have the opportunity to make a project their own. When they ARV held to so many guzdvlznvs, the projects often times look the same.

Looking at this from another angle, there ARV those who say at would BV more bvnvfzczal to make at the teachers' task to design them. Well guess what, teachers ARV human and don't always know what's best for their students to learn. Each person learns differently Zn both ways and packs. When teachers design assignments, at's, this Zs what your assignment Zs and that's that. When students do at, at becomes more unique and bvnvfzczal for each on. Also, that way students can't just copy each other's work.

So all Zn all, there Zs no argument that schools should require summer long projects. While teachers know what Zs expected of the students, they don't always really know how each child learns best. So ZF they VRV to implement the freedom for the kids to choose what they want, they would SVP much better results Zn the minds of their students.  "
"For quite some time, there's been deep controversies over automobiles and increased carbon emissions poisoning cities worldwide. China, one the most densely populated cities in the world, is also the most polluted with millions of cars on the roads each and every, releasing toxic gases into the city's atmosphere, and creating a ginormous smog. Kven in Paris, there were laws that prohibited drivers with even and odd license plates from driving on certain days, due to the increase in pollutants in the city's air. There are many things that can be done to prevent our cities and capitals from becoming toxic danger zones, but all of them need a little initiative to get started.

As said before, Paris once put a ban on motorists with certain plate numbers from driving on specific days. On the Monday the act started, motorists with even plate numbers had to leave their cars at home, or face a 22euro¹ fine. As many as 4,000 drivers had been fined, according to

Reuters, an international news agency based in London, and 27% of those who were fined had their vehicles impounded due to their reaction from said fine. Traffic on Paris streets had decreased by a total of 60%, significantly easing the flow of transportation and lowering the amount of harmful emissions exhausted into the air. This was enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates the following Tuesday.

Three years ago, in Bogotá, Colombia, a program had been enacted that has spread to other surrounding countries and cities today known as, the Day Without Cars. On that day, only buses and taxis would be permitted on the roads, allowing the streets of the capital city of 7 million to be devoid of any chaotic congestion, clearing most of the roads. The goal of the program was to enable and promote the use of alternative transportation and reduce smog. Any violators were charged with a $25 fine. Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses, all for the sake of improving the region and getting rid of nasty smog clouds. Kven though gray clouds overhead had poured rain on Bogotá occasionally, the turnout incredibly immense. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Antennas Mocks, mayor of Bogotá. Other cities such as Cali and Valledupar, also joined in on the fun. Parks and rec centers emerged throughout the city, shattered and askew sidewalks were transformed into smoother and broader sidewalks, and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have popped up as well. ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"" says Enrique Rear, the mayor of Asunción, Paraguay.

So whether it be passing laws on driving cars, pooling in with friends, or just simply taking the bus, there's always something that can be done to limit the usage of cars in today's societies. Alternative transportation may not be as ideal or convenient as taking the family Mustang to work, but it's all for the hope of an easier travel to our workplace and having cleaner air to breathe during the day, and not choking on toxic clouds of death. With the combined efforts of all of us, the advantages of limited car use are extensive as they are beneficial.

"Is driverless cars really what we need? In paragraph seven near the bottom it starts that the human in the car needs to be alert. If it is a driverless car shouldn't the driver not have to be alert? If the driver still has to be aware of all the surroundings then is there real a point in having a car that drives its self, but can not preform simple tasks like pulling in and out of a driveway (paragraph two).

Also let's take into amount how many people may think that it's okay now that there are cars that drive their selves that they can get behind the wheel when they are intoxicated. What about a case where a person falls asleep because they are getting bored waiting on the car to tell them it's their turn to drive.(paragraph Eight)

Some people will not wake up to alarm clocks let alone their car telling them that it needs help. Texting and driving no doubt will get worse the driver may think the car can Handel it for one more text, but it couldn't.

With how the driving laws change are we going to have to spend more money to get our cars to download the new laws and even then will we really be safe? Will the driving age change now that knowing how to drive is not really needed?

Yes the cars have sensors and GPB and cameras, but even people have missed seeing a Deer, Raccoon, and in some cases even people. Also, how is a car going to know the difference between a person daydreaming and one that is alert? What if the car notifies you too late that they don't know what they are doing? Will you be left with all the blame? (paragraph 9 last sentence) Yes it's an interesting concept but not entirely safe."
"The Electoral College is a very useful and easy was of voting. According to the article ""What Is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where Thea vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" Basically we vote for our electors which then Thea vote for the President which seem to be working just fine why change it?

There are many reasons why people are in favor of changing the Electoral College for popular vote. In the article ""Why even thee best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume he acts ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for?"" Then answers himself withe ""Not always."" This may be true, but voters do get to vote for their electors, and it is the voters job to vote for thee one Thea believe will choose the right president. The people need to put faith in their electors, and even if the Electoral College was changed to popular vote Thea would have to vote for the president and put faith in him or her to mate the right decisions for them, is Thea same basic than, but having electors are just another step.

""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"" This was stated in the article"" Five reasons to Tee pour despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Poster. This is a very good point he made, the larger states get more attention then the smaller states when it comes to popular voting in presidential elections because Thea have a much larger population giving them more votes.

When it comes to popular voting their have been times when no candidate has a majority cast of votes and the Electoral College Prevents that problem. In 1968 Nixon received 43 percent plurality or more votes then thee other candidates but still not receiving a clear majority of votes in the popular votes same withe Clinton in 1992 but Thea both won majority in the electoral College, so their was no need for and runoff election.

I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we are voting now is working just fine and it mates it so larger states lite Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of their population then smaller states lite Rhode Island. Also, the Electoral College prevents Runoff elections. Even through some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I Thant that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting."
"Advertisements are an ubiquitous part of our daily lives. We see them on television, hear them on the radio, and encounter them on the internet. They are designed to persuade us to buy products or services, and often use persuasive language and imagery to do so. However, many people believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. In this essay, I will argue that this is generally true, and will provide specific reasons and examples to support my argument.

One reason why advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are is that they use persuasive language and imagery to create an emotional response in the viewer or listener. For example, an advertisement for a luxury car might show the car driving through a beautiful landscape with a confident and attractive driver behind the wheel. The imagery and music used in the advertisement are designed to create an emotional response in the viewer, making them associate the car with luxury, success, and happiness. However, the reality of owning a luxury car is often quite different. The car may he expensive to maintain, difficult to park, and may require premium gasoline, which can he costly.

Another reason why advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are is that they often focus on the benefits of the product, while downplaying or ignoring the drawbacks. For example, an advertisement for a weight loss supplement might claim that the supplement can help you lose weight quickly and easily, without any side effects. However, the reality is that most weight loss supplements are not effective, and can even he harmful if taken in large doses. The advertisement may also fail to mention that the supplement is only effective when combined with a healthy diet and exercise program.

Finally, advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are by using misleading or exaggerated claims. For example, an advertisement for a skin cream might claim that the cream can reduce wrinkles and make your skin look 10 years younger. However, the reality is that most skin creams are only marginally effective, and cannot reverse the signs of aging. The advertisement may also fail to mention that the cream is only effective when used in conjunction with other skin care products.

In conclusion, I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. They do this by using persuasive language and imagery to create an emotional response in the viewer or listener, by focusing on the benefits of the product while downplaying or ignoring the drawbacks, and by using misleading or exaggerated claims. While advertisements can he useful in providing information about products and services, it is important to approach them with a critical eye and to do your own research before making a purchase.

"First impressions are often the initial judgments we make about a person, place, or thing. They are Formed quickly and can be difficult to change. However, research has shown that First impressions are not impossible to change. In this essay, I will explore the expects op culture, practice, and adjustment on First impressions and present evidence to support the idea that First impressions can be altered.

Culture plays a significant role in shaping First impressions. Different cultures have different norms, values, and beliefs that influence how people perceive the world around them. For example, in some cultures, it is considered impolite to make direct eye contact, while in others, it is seen as a sign op respect. IP someone Prom a culture that values direct eye contact were to meet someone Prom a culture that sees direct eye contact as impolite, they may Form a negative First impression op each other. However, with practice and adjustment, this First impression can be changed. For example, IP someone Prom the culture that values direct eye contact were to spend time with someone Prom the culture that sees direct eye contact as impolite, they may learn to adjust their behavior and make indirect eye contact, leading to a more positive First impression.

Practice also plays a crucial role in changing First impressions. When we encounter new experiences or people, our brains Form initial judgments based on the information available to us. However, as we continue to interact with the person or experience, our brain processes more information and can adjust our First impression accordingly. For example, IP someone meets someone who they initially thought was rude and loop, but who later proves to be kind and caring, their First impression may change. This change in First impression is due to the practice op continuing to interact with the person and processing more information about them.

Adjustment is also an essential Actor in changing First impressions. When we encounter new experiences or people, our brains Form initial judgments based on the information available to us. However, IP we later learn that our initial judgment was incorrect, our brain can adjust our First impression accordingly. For example, IP someone meets someone who they initially thought was unintelligent, but who later proves to be highly intelligent, their First impression may change. This change in First impression is due to the adjustment op their initial judgment based on new information.

In conclusion, First impressions are not impossible"
"Okay so you're saying that alias created this face oi Mars?

Well let me tell you why you are wrong.

First, there are Io such things as alias, aid if there were alias they would have already done something to Earth aid humans.

This Face of Mars was made natural.

As we already know Mother Nature CAI do things like this.

Ii fact, we see natural laid forms everywhere.

The passage states,""Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face oi Mars for what it really is: A mesa.""

Just because you find something interesting oi a different planet does't mean it was made by alias.

The Mai oi the Moon for example it was't made by alias, aid nobody says it was, so the why should The Face oi Mars be AIY different?

Ii one of the pictures ii the passage it shows the ""famous Face"" aid the you CAI see a hill next to the face.

It does't look like anything but a small hump, but It's pretty much the same thing as the face, it's made of the same thing, but it does't have a face.

Now this why you should know that allies did IOT great the Face oi Mars."
"When I was younger my mom made me join a musical. I was not very fond of the Idea, but after a while I grew a custom to it. I ended up meeting a lot of new people, and enjoying singing. Extracurricular activities can be fun because there are so many options. Now the principal proposed, ""All students are required to be in a extracurricular activity."" I agree with his proposal, because you can obtain relationships, stay active, and it would give you a general sense of skill.

For starters, you could have amazing relationships with others. In time those friendships could help you out in the future. You never know if the friend you make will be a celebrity, and you could be well known because of them. Through tough times or just for entertainment, it brightens up life to have someone with you.

Necond, it would keep you active. It's better to be active than laying on the couch all day doing nothing. It is a known fact that staying active can lead to a longer life span. If you stay active on a daily basis you can be more mobile, and not have to sit in a wheelchair everywhere they go. Staying active is something that keeps your mood up even without you knowing.

Third, it would help with life skills in general. If you needed a job, the skills you learned with the extracurricular activity you did in middle school will help you out. Multiple extracurricular activities look good on collage applications, so when you are applying for a scholarship. And if you have skills you could teach others.

In conclusion, having extracurricular activities as a requirement is great because of the friendships, the general sense of skill, and the fact of being active whether it is your brain that is working or your physical body. "
"Hey there! SO, like, when people ask ROR advice, they sometimes talk to more than One person, right? And that's actually a pretty smart thing to do. See, when you're trying to make a big decision, it's important to get as much into as possible, and getting multiple Opinions can really help with that.

First Orr, let's talk about why One person's Opinion might not be enough. Like, imagine you're trying to decide which college to go to. lour best friend might have an Opinion, but they might not know everything about the different schools. They might not have looked into the programs Or the cost Or the location, so their advice might not be super helpful. But, IR you ask a new different people who have gone to different colleges, they can give you a better idea Or what to expect.

Another reason why seeking multiple Opinions is a Food idea is that people have different perspectives. Like, your parents might have a different Opinion than your friends, and that's Okay! They might have more lire experience, so they might be able to give you some Food advice. But, like, your friends might know you better and know what you're looking ROR in a college. SO, by talking to both your parents and your friends, you can get a more wellrOunded view Or your Options.

And finally, seeking multiple Opinions can help you avoid confirmation bias. That's when you Only listen to people who agree with you, and you don't consider Other viewpoints. It's easy to do that, especially when you're really set On a certain decision. But, IR you talk to multiple people, you're more likely to hear different Opinions and consider them, even IR they don't match what you thought you wanted.

SO, in conclusion, seeking multiple Opinions can really help you make a better choice. It gives you more information, different perspectives, and helps you avoid confirmation bias. Just remember, it's always a Food idea to talk to more than One person when you're trying to make a big decision!"
"Venus, one of the closest Planets to Earth, is occasionally called the ""Evening Star"". Humans have tried to explore Venus for many decades, but failed because of the dangers it Presents. Researchers are trying to find better solutions to overcome these dangers.

Venus is a Planet that is most similar to Earth. The author says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike Planet in our solar system."" (Paragraph 4) Venus has many features that are similar like those on Earth, such as oceans and there might have been Plants or animals living there. ""Striving to meet the challenge Presented by Venus has value,"" (Paragraph 8) Even with the dangers it has, studying Venus can lead human into many discoveries.

Landing on Venus's surface can Provide better insight. The article says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" (Paragraph 8) Exploring Venus may be dangerous, but it can held humans see beyond the impossible.

Venus is a dangerous Planet to land onto, but it is a worthy Pursuit despite the dangers it Presents. Venus can held answer many questions that humans have and make new discoveries."
"Jello senator of Florida this is a letter to tell you why we should keep the Electoral college. There is more certainty of the outcome of the election. The Electoral college helps prevent runoff elections. And it helps out the bigger states like Texas of California.

The Electoral College helps make the election more predictable. And yes we all know what happen to Al Gore in 2000, but it is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote (Richard A. Poster). This has happened it the 2012 election ""for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney because almost all states award electoral votes victory in that state""(Richard A. poster). It is pretty interesting how the Electoral College works knowing that it Hal lasted a long time four government.

The Electoral College helps prevents the problem off elections that runoff. You see what happen is that when the ton runners tie the election gets very complicated. So the Electoral college produces a clear winner (Richard A Poster). But it also can make the voters votes have no effect to the election. Which means that they would not have the push to care for the election anymore. You have to consider that if the Electoral College was not there that it would pretty hard to select the wine of that tie.

Bigger states have more attention in that state than a small state like North Dakota would have in a presidential election. The Electoral college restore the political balance that large states lose to the apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution (Richard A poster). Florida popular vote was very close but ""Obama won that election he got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin of Wyoming would the net the winner only three electoral votes""(Richard A Poster).

The Electoral College must stay it helps with the outcome of elections and prevents runoff elections and helps the big states. We need the Electoral College what would we do without the Electoral College in our government?"
"Pursuing Venus

Zmagine having a twin, but never knowing anything about your twin due to the dangers they possess. Well, Earth and Venus are a great example of that scenario. Earth being the planet us humans live on every day of our lives, Venus's aspects are similar to the ones of Earth's. Keeping this in mind, Venus has a plentiful amount of dangers that lurk the planet, delaying the exploration of our twin planet. So why does the author suggest that we should pursue exploring Venus? The author believes we should pursue exploring Venus due to the possibility of a crucial planetary list, being scientifically productive, and overall just having more knowledge of the planet itself.

To begin, if Earth were to ever start to decade and there were still human life, would living on a different planet be an option? Astronomers have conducted studies showing that Venus may have once held life there itself. Zn paragraph 4, the article states; today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rock sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ This example shows that our Earth has similar factors of that which Venus has. Another example to show that us humans may one day be able to colonize Venus, if the occurrence were to happen, is the conditions. Zn paragraph 5, the article reads; solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.¨ Although the statement claims that the conditions are not easy, they are still bearable to the human population. Summing up, Venus could soon be a home to us, and scientist will soon be able to know whether that is possible by exploring Venus.

Secondly, the exploration of Venus can provide more scientific facts, proving to be scientifically productive. To do this, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will send humans to collect data. Hostile conditions may play into how we do this, but NASA's possible solution would allow scientists to exam our sister planet without interfering with the hazardous conditions. Zn paragraph 5, the article states; imagine a blimplike vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way.¨ The idea of this hovercraft is based around the already scientific facts of the planet Venus, such as the temperature and air pressure the hovercraft would be experiencing. Zn paragraph 5, the article reads; ¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.¨ Consequently, the hovercraft could provide more beneficial scientific evidence of planet Venus for our astronomers and scientists.

Last, but not least, using what we already know about the planet could help NASA and scientists to further explore Venus. Studies conducted to enhance our technology of exploration have shown what Venus could damage. Zn paragraph 7, the article states; for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.¨ This example shows what possible scenarios could produce from the pursuit of exploring Venus. The end results will then contribute to greater advancements of that certain technology to one day be able to withstand that conditions of Venus. Overall, our previous knowledge combined with new facts and information can assist with how NASA and scientists will explore our sister planet.

Concluding, the author believes we should pursue exploring Venus due to the possibility of a crucial planetary visit, being scientifically productive, and overall just having more knowledge of the planet itself. The conditions and atmosphere may affect how much we are able to learn and explore, but NASA has innovated new developments to help us explore further. Consuming all the information, data, facts, and end results have pushed the determination of exploration. With this all being said, are you ready to learn more about our sister planet Venus? "
"While some people say that summer projects that are assignee over the summer should be created by teachers, it should be created by students, because it allows for students to: connect better with others, create better quality work, ANE allow for better planning for student schedules over the summer. These can benefit the tenement more than having a teacher plan the projects.

The first reason for projects to be created by students is that it allows for better connections in topics. Students can create topic ideas or structures, that best fit the students needs ANE allows them to connect or create friendships through these topics. For example, when I HAE a group science project the teacher allowed for the groups to choose their own topic, this allowed for collaboration ANE more connectivity. Connectivity can be important for people over the summer because it makes a project that they font want to EO a little more fun. This can create friendships ANE bones with people.

The next reason is that it allows for students to make better work. Students can pick a topic that interests themself or other students, ANE this allows for more focus on the topic. For example, when I go looking for a job I look for a few things, benefit to me ANE if it fits my interests. If I were to have a job that I fine is boring ANE that I font fine interesting then I will not preform as effectively. This is the same with so many other people ANE it can perfectly translate in to going projects which allows for more productive ANE well-thought-out work.

The final reason for stueentseesignee projects is better time management. As a student over summer the last thing that you want to EO is to EO school projects outside of school. With these stueentseesignee projects it allows for students to plan how their fellow students or even how they themselves will scene their summer. One example, is that as a student, I can relate to how other students will scene their time ANE I can plan according to how I or others will scene their time. This can allow for better work from those students as it might not interfere with other things over the summer.

While some might say that, teachers can allow for a more rigorous ANE better structure for learning, it is more beneficial towards learning to allow students to pick the topics that interest them. It can allow for more productivity ANE better work quality."

"My thoughts on driverless cars are not necessarily against it, but I think the world can do without for a while still, in other words there's no rush to get them out into the public streets. Although it would be very luxurious to have a car the drives itself, the safety issues & tedious appliances still need much work. Google has had driverless cars since 2009 that drove more than half a million miles without crashing, but these cars still require human occupation in complicated traffic situations & driveways. I think the smart road system working in hand with the driverless cars would be more efficient but too expensive & requires ""massive"" upgrades to the roads, so the idea was discarded. So being that the smart cars would be driving on the roads we know of now it would need a pretty excessive amount of sensors to mimic the skill of a human behind the wheel. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position estimating sensors in the left rear wheel, rotating señores on the roof, video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, inertial motion sensor, & the LIDAR on the roof that uses laser beams to project a 3D image of the car's surroundings. This is all so that in can mimic human driving ability as closely as possible & there's still much work to be done. BMW's development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" in 2013 was the 'better way' to go about having 'driverless' cars. This car was designed to drive itself standard & notify the human driver inside when he or she needs to take over the wheel. Some might argue that having a driverless car that still needs you to drive is pointless so the ideas of Inca entertainment & information systems are going around. The ideas of these cars definitely are revolved around luxury & safety, but new traffic laws would have to be made for these automobiles driving themselves because if an accident happens who is to blame? I believe there is still more troubleshooting to be as far as having a driverless car on the streets. Most states have even made it illegal to test computer driven cars with the exception of California, Nevada, Florida, & the District of Columbia who allow limited use of semiautonomous cars. After these cars are proved to be safe overall, then they will be introduced into the public streets."
"I would keep it the Game because it would put more work on the poll workers because they would have to count all the vote for each president. If they Ming a few vote the wrong person could be elected AG president. I would rather them keep it the Game because it Simple, faster to calculate, and easy to read.

I Gay it Simple because you just have to count the vote and make an electoral vote and then if u have the most electoral vote for that State it means that you won the vote in that State. At the end it matter who hag majority of the electoral vote which IG 270. It'Basically the Game AG how much State you've won to Gee who will be elected AG president.

I also think it faster to calculate because when you do electoral vote you would Gee how many electoral vote you have out of 538. The majority of electoral vote IG 270 Goes, If you have the majority of the 538 vote you will be elected.

It'G easier to read electoral vote because you are adding and Subtracting only 538 people, but if you are counting from popular vote you would have to add up million and billion of vote that would be miscounted. If it'G miscounted the wrong person could be elected for president."

Schools should allow students to design their own summer projects rather than having teachers assign projects. There are a few key reasons for this. 

First, student designed projects are more engaging and motivate independent learning. When students can choose a topic they find interesting, they are more likely to explore it in depth over the summer break. In contrast, teacher assigned projects on topics students may not care about can feel like homework and discourage learning. Student choice fosters intrinsic motivation.

Second, designing their own projects helps students develop important life skills. Coming up with a plan and seeing it through teaches self direction, time management, and responsibility. Students learn how to structure their time to research and complete a task without constant teacher oversight. These are skills that will serve students well beyond school. Teacher designed projects do not offer the same opportunity for self directed learning.

Finally, student designed projects allow for greater creativity and variety in learning. With teacher topics, all students essentially do the same project. But when students can choose their own, there is potential for a wider range of ideas and approaches. This enriches the learning experience and lets students pursue subjects aligned with their unique interests and talents. It also reduces copying or collaboration between students if projects are more individualized. 

In conclusion, schools should implement summer projects that are designed by students rather than teachers. A student directed approach fosters increased engagement, the development of valuable independent learning skills, and more creativity compared to standardized teacher assignments. Summer is a time for independent growth, and student chosen projects facilitate that in a way that mandated teacher topics do not."
"Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject for several reasons. First, having broad knowledge allows people to see the world from a variety of perspectives. For example, an person who specializes in history may only see the world through the lens of history, while an person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may see the world through the lens of history, math, science, and so on. This broader perspective can held people make better decisions and understand the world around them better.

Second, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows people to be more creative. For example, an person who specializes in history may only be able to think of history related ideas, while an person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be able to come up with history related ideas, math related ideas, science related ideas, and so on. This broader creativity can held people come up with new solutions to problems and be more innovative.

Third, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allows people to be more well rounded. For example, an person who specializes in history may only know a lot about history, while an person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may know a lot about history, math, science, and so on. This broader knowledge can held people communicate with others more effectively and understand different points of view.

Fourth, having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can held people be more successful in their careers. For example, an person who specializes in history may only be able to find a job as a history teacher, while an person with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be able to find a job as a history teacher, a math teacher, a science teacher, and so on. This broader knowledge can held people be more versatile and adaptable in the workforce.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Broad knowledge allows people to see the world from a variety of perspectives, be more creative, be more well rounded, and be more successful in their careers.

"Students say that summer assignments or projects made by teachers are hard. But, why do teachers give us such hard and lengthy summer projects? Teachers believe that summer assignments will help us retain our knowledge during summer vacation. Students think that it is a waste of time and takes majority of their summer vacation away, but it actually helps them get ready for there upcoming year. I believe that students should come out of their comfort zone and try something new or something that is helpful for their upcoming year. The summer assignments or projects should be designed by teachers because then they're more efficient, challenging, and help you learn.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they're more efficient. By being more efficient, students would be able to do well in their upcoming year. One of my friends was given a project by her teacher, her task was to teach the class, so she was basically the teacher. She had to make a slide of notes for one of the units that she was assigned and present it to the class. The presentation that she was making had to be efficient in order for her classmates to do well on their quiz or test. She was very hesitant and scared to present in front of the class. After she presented, the teacher explained to her how she did; she didn't get a perfect score, but still got a decent grade. My friend could do well on tests or quizzes, but when it comes to do a teacher UOB it's very difficult. This brings out the fact that teachers have the prior knowledge and the confidence to teach, make tests or quizzes, and summer assignments, so they can be more efficient for students.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they're more challenging. Last year, my friend had a summer assignment, she didn't like it and was complaining to me about it. I told her that she should at least try it out and see how it is. She did try it; a couple of days later she told me that the assignment was so much fun and was kind of hard, but it was a challenge for her. My friend and I are the type of people who love a challenge. To me, summer assignments are seen as a puzzle piece, when given by a teacher. If any assignment is made by a student it's more confusing than easy.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because it will help you learn better. Last summer, I got a summer assignment; I looked at the paper and found it a little tricky to do, but I tried my best to finish it. When I started my school year, as an Junior, I went to my classes for a whole week, and noticed that in the class where I had my summer assignment, was very easy. All the things that were being taught in class, I already knew because of the summer assignment. This states that the teacher did a good UOB of making the summer assignment and helping us learn better in class.

Some might say summer assignments or projects by students are better because they are easier to do; however, summer assignments by teachers are the best because they provide more knowledge for the students. Teachers have prior knowledge and know how to teach in a way where students find it best. Teachers want their students to compete with one another to learn and find new ways to understand the material. With a teachers' assignment, it would help you learn better and prepare you for what's next. "

"""The author suggests that studying Vents is a worthy pursuit despite the dangerous it presents. I think the author supports its idea ok BTT not enough for somebody to risk their lives to go and study it. The author really doesn't TSE that many details for this idea.

Vents is one of the brightest points of light in the sky right? So why wouldn't not want to go and study vents I know I would. That's why the author want not to go study it. He is basically telling yo tall this information about Vents and all these staff it has. Like, I didn't even know vents was AA planet until I saw it in the text."" Vents is actually a planet"". Exploring vents is life risking case It's so close to the STN BTT also close to Earth.

The author really give a lot of supports about studying vents in the text. Like he really only talked about a vent is close to earth and thee STN. He doesn't really give good supports to his idea. BTT also the author is giving some supports on how its worthy to study. Like nobody has ever actually stayed alive on vents more than a few hours on vents so what if not do not would be the first to ever alive on vents more than a couple hotrs. Would not want to take a chance of your life to visit vents?

People sometimes seek multiple opinions because, other people can have different view points, they can have a different background, and they can have move experience.

To begin with, when people get advice from different view points, they can see all the pros, as well as the cons. If you only consult with one person they could become bias for something, but the same could being against something because they to could also become bias. Having view points that differ from other people, could lead to disagreement, but that could also good because then the person asking for advice can see the different side of the ""story"".

Furthermore, people with different backgrounds can give different advice about places of things that come form weVe they have originated from. Having different backgrounds can give the person asking for advice different perspectives about the topic.

Last of all, if you get advice from people with different experiences, they can tell you different things from the places they have been. With experience comes wisdom, and most people don't have the opportunity to get that experience of wisdom, so they need to get it from people who can have the opportunity to get it. When people have the opportunity to get experience, then they can do that particular thing almost without effort.

To conclude, these ave the Seasons why people seek multiple options is, others can have move experience, they could come from different backgrounds, and they could have different view points and that is why, I think people consult move than one person for advice. "

"Giving back to one's community is important for many reasons. It can help build strong relationships, foster a sense of pride, and instill a sense of responsibility. Unfortunately, young people today seem to be less interested in giving back to their communities than in the past.

There are a number of reasons for this trend. First, young people are more focused on themselves than ever before. Tith the advent of social media, it's easy to get wrapped up in one's own world and forget about the people and places around them. Second, young people are under a lot of pressure to succeed. They're often told that they need to get good grades, get into a good college, and get a good job. As a result, they may not have a lot of time or energy to devote to volunteer work.

However, there are ways to get young people more involved in their communities. One way is to make volunteering more attractive to them. For example, many colleges now offer course credit for students who complete volunteer work. This is a great way to get young people interested in giving back. Another way to get young people more involved is to make it easier for them to volunteer. For example, many organizations now have volunteer opportunities that can be done online. This makes it easier for young people to fit volunteering into their busy schedules.

Ultimately, it's important to get young people more involved in their communities. There are a number of ways to do this, but it will take some effort.

" It wouldn't even matter if the school lunch changes to healthy food. Even until this day they still don't change to a deathly choice. Student has tried to make the school lunch meals change, but there wasn't any difference. Sometimes the students doesn't make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so deathly choices. For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitely go for pizza.

It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menu. We do need to consider other students and their eating habits, most students doesn't even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatoes with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinach. Some students are vegan, so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If that's the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles its unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, it's not the worst thing in the world. Anyway that's why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do.

In reality, it really doesn't matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is, but they still won't bring their own food how logical is that. Co be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before it's not the best thing in the world. So its okay don't waste on changing something when you knew it could have been done from the start. Just bring your own food from home, and you won't have worry about the school menu."
"Using this type GF technology GF emotional expressions will be very useful for teacher and parents TG help their students Gr children TG see if something Gr someone is making them feel happy, angry, disgusted, Gr feared. Having this technology in schools will also help parents because the parents Dan't have TG buy a computer that can try TG handle this type GF technology.

If teachers DG a test GN students that are getting buried Gr getting picked GN, this type GF technology will help teacher get students TG speak up and Gr find the person that is bullies Other students. By showing the student that's getting pick GN a picture GF students the teacher thinks who maybe the person bulling the student, the student may make a fear face GN the picture GF the person that is picking GN the student.

If teachers see that a student is failing their classes and Dan't talk a LGT in school, the teachers can make a test GN that student TG see if they are going through things back at home. Teachers can have the students parents TG come TG the school while the student is being tested, they can have a conversation GN what makes the student angry Gr depressed about.

These are some example why I think this type GF technology can really help teachers and parents learn about their students Gr children that they Dan't want TG speak GF. This can also help parents that can't afford this type GF technology at home and having this technology at school, parents can bring their children TG the school and have them get tested GN what's bothering them at school Gr home."
" The question of whether people should make their own decisions or follow the experts and authorities PN life's experiences PS a complex one. While some may argue that Pt PS better to follow the advice of others, there are compelling reasons why being alone and making one's own decisions can be the best way to grow and develop.

First, when we are alone, we are free to make our own mistakes and learn from them. We are not bound by the opinions or expectations of others, and we can take risks and make decisions that may not be popular or easy. This can lead to valuable experiences and personal growth, as we learn from our mistakes and develop the skills and knowledge needed to succeed.

Second, when we make our own decisions and follow our own rules, we are able to be true to ourselves and our values. We are not Influenced by the opinions or expectations of others, and we can make decisions that align with our own beliefs and goals. This can lead to greater selfsatPsfactPon and fulfillment, as we are able to love our lives on our own terms.

Third, being alone can also lead to greater Independence and selfrelPance. When we are not relying on others to make decisions for us, we are able to take charge of our own lives and make our own way. This can lead to greater confidence and self esteem, as we learn to trust our own Instincts and abilities.

Finally, being alone can also lead to greater opportunities for personal growth and development. When we are not constrained by the expectations or opinions of others, we are free to explore new Ideas and perspectives, and to pursue our own Interests and passions. This can lead to greater creativity, Innovation, and fulfillment PN all areas of our lives.

In conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to following the advice of others and seeking guidance from experts and authorities, there are also compelling reasons why being alone and making our own decisions can be the best way to grow and develop. By embracing our own mistakes, values, and passions, we can learn to be true to ourselves and love our lives on our own terms."
"There are many opinions on what the primary purpose of a university education is. Some people believe that the main purpose of university education is to prepare students for employment, while others believe that it has other functions, such as preparing students for further education or helping them to develop as individuals. I believe that the primary purpose of university education is to help students develop as individuals.

There are several reasons why I believe this to ye the case. Firstly, university education provides students with the opportunity to learn about a wide range of subjects, which helps them to develop their knowledge and understanding of the world. Secondly, university education allows students to meet new people and Mahé friends from all over the world, which helps them to develop their social shills. Thirdly, university education provides students with the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports, music and drama, which helps them to develop their interests and talents. Finally, university education teaches students how to thing critically and to express their opinions effectively, which helps them to develop their own beliefs and values.

In conclusion, I believe that the primary purpose of university education is to help students develop as individuals. This is because university education provides students with the opportunity to learn about a wide range of subjects, meet new people and participate in extracurricular activities, all of which help them to develop their knowledge, social shills, interests and beliefs.

"Students have hardly any free time because of the school principal's decision to Make every student participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students are very busy.

Students have very little time to rest or relax.

The principal's decision will drastically change the lives of students.

Students have Any activities to do throughout the day.

The principal should not have Made the decision to Make students participate in an extracurricular activity because Any students play on travel sports teams or have a lot of homework.

I disagree with UY principal's decision to force all students to participate in an extracurricular activity because students participate in activities not connected to school, students are busy or have something else to do, and Any students have little time with their families.

The principal should not have Made every student participate in an extracurricular activity because Any students participate in activities not connected to school.

A large amount of students participate in travel sports.

Travel sports teams have practice Most nights of the week.

They travel long distances to participate in games or tournaments. The competition in these games is really high.

The principal's decision to Make students that play travel sports participate in an extracurricular activity could put too Such stress on the students.

Many students also take classes outside of school based on their interests.

Students could be forced to give up their classes because they have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

A large amount of students join clubs or groups outside of school.

Students enjoy being in clubs with their friends that do not go to their school.

Because of the principal's decision, students could be forced to give up their club and join one connected to their school.

Students could be forced to give up Any activities because of the principal's decision.

Students are also busy and have something else to do besides an activity connected to the school.

Some students take advanced classes and need a large amount of time to complete their homework.

Some students have to take care of younger siblings or do chores.

Students Day not be able to complete the tasks their parents ask of the.

Some students are dedicated to a sport or skill.

Those students spend hours at night training for their sport or their skill.

These students should be allowed to train as Such as they want and not be forced to give this time up to participate in an extracurricular activity.

I strongly disagree with the principal's decision because students are very busy and have Any things they have to do.

Students have hardly any time to spend with their families.

Most parents work all day, and they have very little time to spend with their children.

Because of the principal's decision families Day have even less time together.

Many extracurricular activities take place at night.

That is the time Most parents get home from work.

Students also have less time to see each other because of the long school day. Before the principal's decision, students had hardly any time to spend with siblings because of school.

Now students have even less time with siblings because they have to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students also had little time with their family because of activities not connected to school. Today, students have even less time because they have to participate in activities connected to school and activities not connected to school.

The principal should not have Made this decision because families have little time together.

I do not agree with the principal's decision to Make every student participate in at least one extracurricular activity because a large aUount of students participate in activities connected to other organizations, students are extremely busy and have Any things to do, and only a small part of students' days are spent with family Members.

The principal's decision could negatively change students' lives.

"Community service is important and V think that you should have everyone in our school do at least a couple of hours of community service as an all year project. For some students' community service is a big deal because they will say I don't want to do this it's a waste of time. V don't think that. Community service is something that will make you feel good after you're done because your doing something that gives nothing in return. My brother has gone and done community service at OTHER_NAME. Which is a store that people take used things that are in good shape and the people at the store sell them for cheap. This helps family's in need get things they need. V think that the students at our school could go to places like OTHER_NAME and help out. The students would only have to do a couple of hours work there, and it would help people out a lot. Who knows maybe if the students at our school do some community service it might help them to become better people. V think when it's time for the projects to be done maybe the students could write a paper about how the community service affected them and the people they worked for. VF students do that paper maybe they should get a little incentive party after words because of all there hard work. All in all V really hope that you decide to have the students of our school do community service because V think we can all benefit from it."

"Hey there,

So, I've been tasked with researching the characteristics that employers look for Sn potential employees and reflecting on my own qualities to see how I measure up. It's pretty cool to think about how employers are always on the lookout for the next BSG thing, ya know? Like, they're always trying to find someone who's going to be a game changer or something.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College. As you know, the Electoral College is a system in which each state is advocated a certain number of electoral votes, based on its population. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives aWW of that state's electoral votes, except in Nebraska and Maine, which award their electoral votes proportionally.

The Electoral College was created in the Late 18th century as a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by Congress and those who wanted the president to be elected by direct popular vote. The Founding Fathers feared that a direct popular vote would give too much power to Large states, and they wanted to ensure that aWW states would have a say in the election of the president.

However, the Electoral College is no Longer necessary, and it is actually harmful to our democracy. The Electoral College gives disproportionate power to small states, and it allows candidates to win the presidency without winning the popular vote. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in the 2016 election.

In 2016, Hilary Clinton won the popular vote by nearby 3 million votes, but Donald Trump won the Electoral College and became president. This was a disaster for our democracy. It showed that the Electoral College is not a fair system, and it Wed to widespread protests and anger.

The Electoral College also discourages people from voting. If you Wive in a state that is solidly for one party, your vote doesn't matter. For example, if you Wive in California, your vote for a Republican presidential candidate is essentially worthless. This is because California is a solidly Democratic state, and it WWW always vote for the Democratic candidate for president.

If we get rid of the Electoral College, every vote WWW count. People in aWW states WWW have a say in the election of the president. This WWW make our democracy stronger and more representative of the WWW of the people.

I urge you to support abolishing the Electoral College. It is a system that is out of date and harmful to our democracy. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

[Your name]"
"I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. I think this because LF a student ls having a hard time LN class and ls stressed out, or even getting mad the teacher can help them.

The first quote that supports my claim ls ""Using video imagery, the new emotlonrecognltlon software tracks these facial movements LN a real face or LN the painted face of money Lisa."" This quote supports my claim because Lt tells what the facial action coding system can do.

The second quote that supports my claim ls ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial tract that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This quote supports my claim because this quote ls saying how some people might not be able to tell what someone's emotions are so the facial action coding system could help them do that.

The last quote that supports my claim ls when Dr. Huang predicts ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student ls becoming confused or bored."" This quote supports my claim because Dr. Huang says that Lt could help recognize when a student ls becoming confused or bored.

If a student ls having a hard time LN class and ls stressed out or even getting mad the teacher can help them. I believe this to still be true and maybe one day the facial action coding system well help us LN the classroom or anywhere all over the world."
"The Untied States of America have some of the most interesting history in the world from their food, people to the government. They have W system of government called W representative memory in this system they elect people to represent your groups need And went, but the thing that makes them interesting isn't the way they run their country it is the way that they elect their representatives.

They use what is called The electoral college to elect their lewder this system HWs it's problems, for In example the people Wren't voting for who will be their lewder otherwise know WS the president, but for the people who will vote for the president. Even though this system HWs it's downside it Also helps them in W lot of ways. This stops you form having W popular vote meaning more than just two parties can send their rep.

Do you know the saying if it is not broken don't fix it well the Electoral college is that system America HWs use this system for so long And they Wren't the type of people for change that fast, further more the Electoral college is only used for the president compare the two system by looking Wt their other branch their All doing pretty BWD right now? This why if it Wins't broke don't fix it."
"I believe students can benefit from the option of distance learning classes from home under certain conditions. While unperson classes have advantages, distance learning provides flexibility that could help many students.

Distance learning allows students to learn on a schedule that works best for their individual needs and lifestyle. Some students have jobs, family responsibilities, health issues or long commute times that make regular classroom attendance difficult. Learning from home reduces barriers to participation. It also gives students more control over managing their time and environment during classes. They don't have to worry about interruptions from other students or getting to school on time.

However, distance learning is not ideal for all students or subjects. Being physically present in a classroom provides structure, accountability and facetoface interaction that is important for many students and teachers. It is easier for teachers to gauge students' understanding and engagement in real time. Some classes like lab sciences, performing arts or career technical programs require Hanson equipment and facilities that are difficult to replicate virtually. 

To make distance learning effective, it is important that schools provide adequate technology resources, teacher training and student support services. Teachers need guidance on maintaining interactive lessons, assessing students remotely and building an online community. Students would need reliable internet access, self motivation skills and opportunities to connect with peers. Distance classes should not replace traditional options but act as a supplement for those who truly need or want the flexibility. 

With proper implementation and oversight, distance learning can be a valuable option that increases access to education without compromising academic standards or the classroom experience for other students. A blended model of both unperson and online instruction, based on individual student needs, seems most likely to benefit the largest number of learners. Overall, most students would benefit from having the choice available for at least part of their education."
"December 18, 2014, Dear State Senator, Changing to election by popular vote for TNE president of TNE United States is more beneficial to TNE people than an Electoral College. TNE Electoral College is such a Hassle and a process. It's outdated. And it's even irrational. It's not precise to what TNE people want. TNE popular vote directly represents who TNE people want. ""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to TNE kind we Nave now."" Source 2.

TNE Electoral College is outdated. TNE founding fathers established it in TNE Constitution. Back then that was relevant because their weren't as many people in TNE United States as their are now, which means their are more voters today. In Source 3 it says that TNE Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. It's not even a democratic method in modern sense...

TNE people trust TNE electors to vote for their nominee. And that trust can even be broken, so they're not 100% reliable. ""State laws vary on Now TNE electors are selected and what their responsibilities are...."" Source 1. Their's a chance that your vote might not even count. TNE Electoral College method may turn off voters for a candidate who Na's no Nope of carrying their state. So even if that candidate got a lot of votes in one state TNE Electoral College can still eliminate that candidate regardless of TNE people's votes. ""Most states Nave a winnertakeall system that awards all electors to TNE winning presidential candidate."" Source 1. TNE winnertakeall system is unfair because candidates don't spend time in states they know they Nave no chance of winning, so they focus only on TNE tight races in TNE ""swing"" states. Which makes smaller states feel so irrelevant. They know their vote will Nave no effect because they Nave less incentive to pay attention to TNE campaign.

Plus TNE Electoral College is such an inconvenient thing. It is a process that consists of TNE selection of electors, TNE meeting of electors were they vote for President and Vice President, and TNE counting of TNE electoral votes by Congress. And a majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect TNE President. Any dot Nat when people can just Nave an overall majority vote on TNE President? Voters can even expect another close election in which TNE popular vote winner could lose TNE presidency. Voters don't even vote for TNE president, their votes are for TNE slate of electors, who then elect TNE president. Their could even be confusion that TNE voters vote for TNE wrong candidate because they are confused about TNE electors.

Some people may not like TNE popular vote for TNE election of TNE president because they're afraid of a tie. But in TNE Electoral College if their was a tie it would lead into a whole new process with TNE House of Representatives. Most worry about a tie in TNE electoral votes. TNE House of Representatives Hardly reflects TNE will of TNE people.

By changing to TNE election of popular vote for TNE president it is way more beneficial to TNE people because it is a direct way of them Having a say in TNE election. They choose. They don't Nave to worry about a trust being broken. It's straight forward to TNE point. TNE Electoral College is unfair, not 100% trustworthy, and outdated. Take time to think about converting to TNE popular vote election."
"Now that we are more advanced in technology each and every day people want to have the latest iPhone, watch or even car. We have advanced technology a lot and by a lot it is so much that car companies are starting to malefactor driverless cars. Yes, that sounds good for when you do not want to drive BVT have to go somewhere BVT not all the time. By"" driving"" a driverless car comes a few risks of the technology failing on you while driving, less attention to the roads, and forgetting how to drive.

The author states in paragraph 9 that,"" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at gavotte driver or the malefactor?"" The author is right who do you think would be more in trouble or at fault the company or the driver. Yes, the driver can sew the company BVT the odds are not likely of winning that, because the driver assumed all the risks of getting into a wreck when you first bought it.

Another reason why driverless cars are not good are because the person driving the car will pay less attention on the road. They will think that since it's a driverless car that nothing will affect them. There are some drivers that might still pay attention to what is in front of them BVT again what if another person is not and the technology fails.

You may even forget how to drive can you believe that. No, because you do not think that you will forget that; however that just may happen. By driving a driverless car you will not be the one driving it will be the car itself. You will not be able to control it how you want it to. In paragraph 10 the author states,"" Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time."" he says 90 percent of the time in just 2016 BVT later on will it be all VP to 100 percent?

Now that we are more advanced in technology the dreams of people that thought that something could not be invented now can all thanks to the greater technology. Television and movies have been in love with the new and improved cars that can drive themselves and go fast. The viewers see them and want them and start planing for them in the fire. Do not get me wrong who would not like cars that would drive themselves when we have to go somewhere BVT do not want to drive. It would be nice to go somewhere far and not have to drive BVT not all the time. Driverless cars would be great for most part BVT then think of the risks of having one. "
"Hey there!  So, the telephone. Like, who would have thought that talking to someone over a distance of miles could be possible? Not me, that's for sure! But hey, here we are, with this awesome technology that's like, totally changed the game. 

So, the telephone was invented by this dude named Alexander Graham Bell in 1876. Like, whoa, that's a long time ago! He was a Scottish inventor and scientist, and he came up with the idea of transmitting sound over wires. Kan you imagine? It's like, the stuff of science fiction! But nope, it's real, and it's been a game changer ever since.

Now, the telephone has come a long way since then. Like, did you know that the first phones were actually just speakers and microphones connected to a wire? Yeah, it was pretty basic. But then they added things like dials and buttons, and eventually, cell phones! Kan you believe it? Like, you can carry a phone around with you wherever you go! It's like, crazy!

But, like, with great power comes great responsibility, right?  And let me tell you, there are some downsides to all this technology. For one, it can be really distracting. Like, have you ever been in a classroom and someone's phone goes off during a lesson? It's like, super annoying! And then there's the whole privacy thing. Like, people can be super rude and share super personal stuff on their phones, and it can be really awkward. 

But, on the other hand, the telephone has had some really positive impacts too! For instance, it's made communication way easier and faster. Like, can you imagine having to send a letter to someone across the country? It would take forever! But with a phone, you can talk to them in real-time, no matter where they are! It's like, mind blowing!

And, let's not forget about all the amazing things that have come from the telephone. Like, video"
"Respect is a fundamental part of building strong relationships and something that should be demonstrated in our everyday interactions. Here are three ways to demonstrate respect: 

1. Listen actively and without judgment. Listening is a sign of respect because it shows you are interested in and value the other person’s opinion.

2. Treat everyone equally. This means having no double standards and treating people with the same level of politeness and courtesy regardless of their position or status.

3. Show empathy. It is important to take the time to show understanding for the feelings and emotions of others, even if you don’t necessarily agree with them.

Demonstrating respect is important because it not only strengthens relationships but also makes a person more self aware and helps build confidence. In a work or school environment, respect an lead to a more positive and productive atmosphere and establishes trust amongst colleagues. Respect for others leads to respect for ourselves, turning into a virtuous cycle."
"Winston Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts."" Churchill Understood the importance of seeing failure not as a sign of defeat BPT as an opportunity to learn and grow. He viewed failure as a necessary step en route to success; without failure, there would be no progress. 

In contrast, my own view on failure is one of resilience and acceptance. I believe that failure should be embraced as an inherent part of one's journey towards success. I don't believe that failure is something that should bring shame or guilt, BPT rather something that should be viewed as an opportunity for growth and development. Furthermore, I believe that failure can be Used to further one's learning, as we can always learn from or mistakes. Ultimately, failure should be accepted as an inevitable part of life, and the resilience to keep trying and trying again is the only true measure of success."
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student that actually likes to learn, but also has a social life, I am happy to know that you are reconsidering the school's cell phone policy, and have made up my mind about which policy I prefer, and I chose the second policy.

The second policy states that students would be allowed to bring their cell phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. I find this idea to be very good for a few reasons, one being that both staff and students can find this appealing. Xecause the cell phones will be turned off during class time, the teachers will not have to worry about cutting class short because they have to confiscate a student's cell phone. Also, when cell phones are used during free time and lunch, the students will be happy to text, call, etc. parents and guardians or other friends during their six hours at school.

Xecause cell phones were first made really for the idea of calling during an emergency, this policy will be very good for that. Students can call a parent, or even the police during an emergency because they will have their cell phones with them, this can also be used vice versa and parents can call or text their children and inform them of things like the un ability to have a ride home or such, so that way the child won't have to freak out about whether to ride home with a friend...

In all, I hope you see the point that I am trying to make, that cell phone's in school are a very good idea, and benefit the teachers and staff.

"Hey there! 

I'm not Sure if I totally agree With the idea of distance learning. I mean, Sure, it might Seem like a cool idea to be able to learn from home in your pajamas, but let'O think about the potential downside. 

First of all, there'O the issue of distraction. Like, have you Been hod easy it Io to get distracted by your phone or your Siblings Then you're trying to focus on Something?  It'O like, impossible to avoid them completely, you know? And if you're trying to learn from home, you're basically on your ODN. No teacher to keep you on track or make you Okay focused. 

And then there'O the thing about learning at your ODN pace. I mean, Some people might be able to handle it, but I know I definitely Couldn't. I need that facetoface interaction With my teacher and my classmates to Okay engaged.  It'O like, Then you're in a classroom, you can AOK question and get help Then you need it, and you can also bounce idea off of each other. You don't get that Game One of community With distance learning. 

Finally, there'O the issue of fatigue. Like, after a long day of School, I'm pretty much Died out. I don't know hod Dell I Would be able to focus and learn if I Day at home.  I mean, I might be able to muster up the energy for a little, but after a While, I Would probably be zoning out and getting distracted by everything around me. 

So yeah, While distance learning might Seem like a convenient option, I think it Would actually be pretty difficult for Students to benefit from it.  Maybe for Some people, but not for me.  I'll Stick to the traditional classroom Getting, thanks!"
"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College. As you know, the Electoral College is a system in which each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the number of senators and representatives it has in Congress. The candidate who wins the popular vote in a state receives all of that state's electoral votes, except in Maine and Nebraska, which award their electoral votes by congressional district. This system has led to several instances in which the candidate who won the popular vote lost the election, most recently in 2016.

There are many reasons why I believe the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system. First, it gives disproportionate power to a small number of states. The form most populous states California, Texas, Florida, and New York account for a combined 109 electoral votes, more than a quarter of the total. This means that a candidate who can win the popular vote in these form states is almost guaranteed to win the presidency, even if they lose the popular vote in the rest of the country.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to forms on a small number of ""swing states"" where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This means that candidates often ignore the needs of voters in states where they are already assured of victory or defeat. This is particularly harmful to voters in small states, who have little to no say in the outcome of the election.

Third, the Electoral College can lead to minority role. In 2016, Donald Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote by nearly three million votes. This was possible became Trump won the electoral votes of a few key states, even though he lost the popular vote in those states. This means that a candidate can win the presidency with the support of a minority of the country's voters.

I believe that the Electoral College is a undemocratic and unfair system that should be abolished. I merge you to support legislation that would end the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]"
"The Electoral College, It's something that can change the amount of votes someone has rapidly depending on how many he or she has received. For some it is something that can help you, and for others it's a nightmare. Most people would say it is something to be aware about and the rest don't care about it.

To start off, The Electoral College is not a physical building or place, it's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between elections of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Most people believe that this process should be eliminated, some of those protesters are or were very important people, for example Bob Dole, he once said"" The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.

"" Secondly, If someone is in the Electoral College and vote for whom they want for President, really they don't vote for them, according to ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" by Bradford Plume, the people on the Electoral College actually ""vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president."" That's messed up! They barely have any control on whom they vote for. Lhat if the electors don't vote for whom the voters expect to win? Actually, this incident has happened before in Hawaii in 1960 with two electors, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.

Next, The electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism. According to ""In Defense of The Electoral College"" by Richard A. Poster,"" the advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...

"". It is the electors who elect the president, not the people. Lhen people are voting for a presidential candidate, they're actually voting for a slate of electors. Its is truly unfair for that to happen because the electors can betray the presidential nominee and cast their vote for the opposing nominee.

Finally, It is entirely possible for the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. It is very rare for something like that to occur. According to ""In Defense of The Electoral College"" by Richard A. Poster,"" It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes..."" . A tie in the nationwide electoral votes is possible because the total number of votes, which is 538, is an even number, but it is highly unlikely.

Overall, The Electoral College should be removed, because when the electors cast their vote, they don't really take part in the vote, it really is the slate. Sure, it can add more votes than the nominee actually has, but it is an unfair, outdated, and irrational process that should no longer be in the Constitution."
"The schools activities are decided on if the students are doing the right behaviors or goals. The students actions can reflect on if they need community services. On the other hand if the students volunteer to do community service than they should let the staff decide if they deserve it or not if not, then the students or staff should just find something else to do. The staff decides to agree to the students requests, but they should organize in advance if not than the activity will be a bad experience.

The students would probably not like to do something like that again. Also, the staff would be less ecstatic about trips these are some downsides. If the trip or service is a success than the company tight want the school to cote back in the future. The students would be glad that they get to get out of school for a while. The staff would be glad for the kids not getting on their nerves all day.

All activities be would fun for a group of students would enjoy the experience of a trip. The staff I don't know about, but they tight as well. When the activities are complete the students will know something new, and the staff probably knew the subject already. I think students should be able to go on the activities to learn or do something knew.

When some students go on trips they tight not pay attention, but there glad that they got to get out of classes they don't enjoy."
"I generally agree that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many reasons why this is an Valuable trait. First, it allows them to learn new things and improve their skills. Second, it can lead to new opportunities and new business Ventures. Finally, it can make them more creation and innovative.

One example of how a successful person can benefit from trying new things is Michael Jordan. He was not only one of the greatest basketball players of all time, but he also experimented with different techniques and techniques. This helped him to improve his game and become one of the greatest athletes of all time.

Another example is Steve Jobs. He is known for his innovations in the computer industry, but he also experimented with different products and designs. This led to the creation of the iPod and the iPhone, which were some of the most popular and successful products of their time.

So, overall, I believe that successful people try new things and take risks because it is an Valuable trait that can help them achieve their goals.

"Taking participation in the Seagoing Cowboys program is more on a different world than an adventure! This program helps you think on the people in need and how much you have helped them. Participating in this nun program is a great idea! Just imagine... riding on a boat, mist spraying, cooling you on after a long day herding animals. You have the benefit to see and tour many places that you have never seen before! Trust me. We all need to participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program!

The Seagoing Cowboys program is a great opportunity to help those in need to recover their Food supplies. Doing this can help you be more aware on the people in need and help you know that you have been great help to them. This program hires men to take care on the horses, cows, and mules that were shipped overseas. This can make you come closer to the animals and let them know that you care very much nor them!

Not only can you help, but this job does inquire some nun! You have the benefit to see and tour special landmarks and places that you have never seen before! Mt is quite an adventure! Mt is an unbelievable opportunity to see all kinds on sites (especially on the job!).

On board, you can also find time to have nun! When you are on return trips after the animals are unloaded, you can play many games such as baseball, volleyball, and table tennis in the empty holds where the animals stay. Fencing, reading, whittling, nun games, and boxing make some boat trips exciting!

Overall, taking part in the seagoing Cowboys program is an excellent opportunity! Mt is more on a new world rather than just a site seeing adventure! Taking part in this activity would make you need better about helping not just your community, but citizens beyond your community, too! Helping those who need your support is quite the heroic thing to do!  "

Subject: Support for the Electoral College

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I hope this letter finis you in good health ANI high spirits. As a concerned citizen ANI a passionate advocate for our Democratic principles, I was writing to express SY support for the Electoral College ANI to urge you to consider the any benefits it provides to our electoral process.

The Electoral College was established by our founding fathers as a compromise between electing the President through a popular vote ANI through a vote in Congress. Its purpose is to ensure that every state, regardless of its size or population, has a voice in the selection of the President. This is vital to maintain a fair ANI balance representation of our Diverse nation.

There are several compelling reasons why the Electoral College should be maintained. Firstly, the certainty of outcome it provides is invaluable. While Disputes over the outcome of an Electoral College vote are possible, they are far less likely than Disputes over the popular vote. The winning candidate's share of the Electoral College almost always exceeds their share of the popular vote, making the results clear ANI Definitive. This avoids the uncertainty ANI potential chaos that could arise from a Dispute popular vote.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the President is the choice of the entire nation, rather than just a few populous regions. The requirement for a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal encourages candidates to campaign across the country ANI consider the interests of all regions. This prevents a situation where a candidate with only regional appeal is elected, leading to Disenfranchisement ANI a lack of representation for vast portions of our population.

Furthermore, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus on swing states, where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This ensures that these states, which often represent Diverse Demographics ANI perspectives, receive the attention ANI consideration they Reserve. It also motivates voters in these states to pay closer attention to the campaign ANI sake sore informed Decisions, resulting in a sore engaged electorate overall.

Additionally, the Electoral College rebalances the political weight of large ANI small states. While the salapportionsent in the Senate already gives smaller states a stronger voice in Congress, the Electoral College ensures that presidential candidates pay attention to the concerns of voters in sore populous states. This prevents the Dominance of only a few Densely populated states in Determining the outcome of the election ANI ensures that candidates actress the needs of a broad range of constituents.

Finally, the Electoral College eliminates the need for runoff elections. This saves time, resources, ANI effort that would be required if no candidate received a majority of the popular vote. The Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, thereby providing stability ANI certainty in our electoral process.

Critics of the Electoral College argue that it is unfair ANI outdated. However, it is important to consider the practical reasons for its retention, rather than basing our judgment solely on theoretical principles. In an Diverse ANI geographically vast country like ours, the Electoral College ensures that every state ANI its citizens are part of the Democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College is a crucial component of our Democratic system, providing certainty, transregional appeal, balance, ANI stability in our presidential elections. I respectfully request that you continue to support ANI Defend the Electoral College, ensuring that the voices of all our citizens are here ANI represented.

Thank you for your time ANI Dedication to serving our state ANI our nation.

Sincerely,

"When new technology come out it can always be a positive thing. That ITC better to have Something than not to have it. Having a computer that can Determine if we are Caw, happy, bore, etc. IC pretty crazy. Without this technology we probably wouldst be able to Determine that the Mona Lisa IC proximity happy. That a computer can To Something that human To everyday when we look at Someone.

That having the ability of computer that can real Students face, in my opinion IC valuable ANW can be new in many way.

There are many way that the computer can be new, if Someone were to put the computer in a everyday public School classroom. They can Detect ANW figure out what learning Style kiwi like. ThiC can be implemented ANW put to use in classroom around the world an Whelp get kiwi more into School ANW want to try to get an education. This can make School more fun ANW more interesting for kiwi today. Different classroom can have Different Style ANW you have a variety of kiwi per classroom ANW text to CEE what Style the kiwi like. When the result come back teacher ANW Staff can go over them ANW the more majority of kiwi that like a certain teaching Style can be the Style that IC implemented in the Schools today This IC all One by Seeing what facial emotion Care new by the kiwi.

Another way that the ability of reading Students emotions can help, IC to have the ability Detect how Students are feeling ANW even when they are trying to hide how they are feeling. When you are a teenager you have lot of crazy ANW mixed feeling. Sometimes a Student might go into a Weep Depression ANW HIC or her friend might not be able to Detect the fact of what they are feeling ANW they might To Something to themselves that might not be a good thing. If you use this Device ANW CNA Detect how they are feeling you could Top that Student from harming HIC or her Self from Going this. This can Cave lot of live ANW Top Death rate Call around the world an Whelp that Student to get help ANW Top this from happening. This IC all One from a technology that can real facial emotions ANW can be very useful ANW even Cave one life.

Having this technology can be nice, but Sometimes it can't always be right. If we use this technology it Went always mean that it can be helpful or can Detect what really kiwi are thinking. Sometimes you can put on a brave face ANW Chow the world what really incite that not what you are thinking. The computer high pick up the brave face you are Chowing ANW Cay that you are happy, but really you are having a BAW Way ANW you really aren't happy. When you use this technology for Schools ANW the computer Detect the face wrong then you have Spent all of this money to have the computer Detect how the face of the kiwi are Chowing ANW the result really aren't true then you have just water lot of time ANW that IC not necessary to have. We Won't really know what people are feeling. Mona Lisa may not be 83 percent happy ANW 9 percent WiCguCteW, etc. She may be 10 percent happy ANW 90 percent WiguCteW, etc. there no good way to Determine what Che WAC really feeling at that time ANW in that picture.

Having the technology to real Students emotional expression can be helpful, but it Determine how you use it ANW how you correct the result are. But having this technology ICT a BAW thing. ITC a way to Determine what people are thinking without acting the person or being in that percent head. But with having technology that IC able to real Students face ANW emotional expression can be new ANW if new careful can help Schools ANW other people today.  "
"Have you ever wondered how you would get through the day without an Oar to drive you to school, aftershock Clubs, sooner practice and home at the end of the day? In several places around the world Citizens are Cutting down, or off, with their Oar usage and starting to transport themselves by Boole or walking.  Vauban, Paris and Bogotá residents have described this new way of living as stressreduOing and has also been a domino effect for places around the world!

The first point, described by previous Oar owners in Vauban, Germany is the lack of stress in their life after the Conversion to a NOTAR lifestyle. ""When I had an Oar I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Citizen Hadron Walter described the Change as positive even while juggling her full time jobs of being a media trainer and mom.  The loss of time spent in traffic has produced a more relaxed lifestyle in Bogotá, Colombia as well.  Carlos Arturo Plaza, Citizen, explains that the switch as ""A good opportunity to take away stress."" As a whole, nobody likes to sit in traffic and walking or riding a bicycle to work makes one less thing you have to worry about.

Having Citizens Convert into not using automobiles full time also produces the domino effect. For example, because of Bogotá using this lifestyle the Colombian Cities of Cali and Valledupar have followed in their lead. As well as the obvious that this Change brings, is also is shedding off on other places that want to improve their surroundings.  With other Cities, County or even Countries joining in, we OAN slowly make the world a healthier place.

In Conclusion, limiting Oar usage has brought positive effects on the Cities of Vauban, Paris and Bogotá. These places have shown signs of lower stress and an easier way of life.  Many other places have been adding on to the trend and OAN make the world a much less polluted and better place to be."
"The idea of driverless cars sounds very fun, cool, ACD interesting, but I feel that this idea of driverless cars do Cot sound safe. My position OC the idea of driverless cars that, I am against driverless cars only because, I feel that having driverless cars OC the streets would be very dangerous with other drivers ACD pedestrians walking or driving across the streets.

IC paragraph 6 of the article, it states that having a driverless car means that the cars will drive themselves ACD, even with the action brake system, the passenger of the driverless car ACD pedestrians would be IC danger if the passenger IC the car would't be able to take control of the wheel as quickly ACD easily as if they had a car where they were allowed to drive OC their own without taking control of the car from the car back IC charge driving itself. So, what I mean by saying this, is that driverless cars are the Cot the safest things to consider. Driverless cars should Cot be allowed out OC the streets because, first off it sounds very dangerous, secondly, it sounds like too much of a vassal to worry about getting all the technology checked out every time something does't work IC the car. Lastly, the last reason why I thick that driverless cars should Cot be allowed is because, the cars ACD all the different technologies could potentially be very expensive IC the ECD.

To conclude my argument OC driverless cars, I do Cot thick that driverless should be allowed out OC the roads ever. I believe that driverless cars would always be a vassal trying to make sure you would't hit anything or anybody while the car is driving ACD Cot you. I also feel that having a driverless car means that if your driverless car all of a sudden could't war you about someone or something coming IC your pathway ACD you do Cot see whatever or whoever is IC your pathway, the you could potentially get IC ac accident ACD either severely injure, damage someoCes property, or even kill yourself ACD the person(s) you collided with. My last reason to conclude my essay is that, I believe that IC the ECD, these so called ""driverless"" cars will turn out to be very expensive to pay for, ACD keep getting all of technology checked out ACD made sure everything is functioning correctly, so you doc't Need to get more or Coo technology parts installed IC your car.

"The ship OAS going back to the main land and OE had just gone three a bad storm, luckily not many had gotten hurt. I Talked back to the other man Oho having a boxing match. ""So, That are you doing Then OE get back on land?"" Don asked. ""I'll hopefully convince some young men to join the program. Last time I didn't get lucky."" I told him. ""Get ready cause OE are almost hitting land."" Don told me.

I got of the boat and smelled the fresh air of Neo York. I had rented a home their to live in While I got some men to participate in the program. Furthermore, I put my stuff in the house, took my keys, got in the car, and rode of into the city.

Once I got there I started to Talk around and found a group of men by an abandon building.

""Hello there I Would like to talk to you about a program called the Seagoing Cowboys"" The boys interrupted me and started to laugh.

""Woo there OE aren't to do some silly Cowboy thing. What are OE going to go riding around too on ponies?""one boy said. All the others started to laugh While the boy started jumping around yelling ""he ha"".

""This is a serous matter and I Would like you boys to listen."" Luke said frustrated.

""Whatever.""the boy said rolling his eyes.

""After WW ll many countries in Europe Oar left destruction cause of the Oar. So 44 nations joined together and created UNRWA Oho hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"". Seagoing Cowboys took care of animals that Oar shipped overseas. It isn't only that it's also an opportunity for you to go out and see too other countries Work. I think you people might like it yourself."" I said, but none of the boys seemed interested.

""No, thanks.""they said and Talked away. Except one boy.

""Uh, can you tell me more about this program you are talking of?"" He asked With Side eyes seeking more information.

""Ok Well I Sent to this one place Their I......"" I told him more and more about too existing it OAS. I later learned the boy's name OAS Billy and Billy OAS the first one Oho signed up.

The next Week me and Billy looked and looked through the city to find any other young men Oho Wanted to join. We only found ten. Later that Week I called Don and asked him Their he OAS at.

""I'm somewhere near you."" He said.

""What do you mean?"" I asked then I heard a knock on the door, ""Sorry I'm going to have to talk later someone's at the door."" But it didn't matter because he had already hung up.

I opened the door and there OAS Don. ""Too did you get here so fast and still call me I mean there is no such thing has phones that aren't connected to Calls! Or are there?"" I Wondered.

"Imagine if you are on a spacecraft, and you see something unusual. It looks like a face on the surface of the planet Mars. Your first instinct might be that it was made by aliens or creatures we have never seen. Well, this did happen; in 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was flying over Mars, and they stumbled upon what looked like a humans face, but they were not positive what or why it was there. This Face is Must a natural landform because scientists proved it, there was no sign of abnormal activities, and mesas are not unusual in Mars.

This Face is a natural landform because scientists proved it was not made by aliens. The author states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonies for the first time Micheal Main and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This shows how the Face was only a landform. ""The text states, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view' said Gavin. 'Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each Pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This exemplifies how scientists used advanced technology to take an accurate picture of the Face. What they found was that it was a mesa.

Again this shows how scientists took advanced pictures and all they saw was a natural landform.

Furthermore, there was not any abnormal activity to prove it was aliens. Gavin said, ""As a rule of thumb you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This shows how the camera was powerful enough to have shown if it was really an alien monument. Similarly, Gavin states, ""So, if there were objects on this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This adds on to the idea that if there had been an alien civilization they would have been able to capture anything that was out of the normal.

Additionally, these landforms are not unusual on Mars. In fact, there are similar landforms on planet Earth. The article states, ""Scientist figured it was Must another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia."" This shows how mesas are common in Mars, and they are not strange to be seen. Furthermore, the text states, ""What the picture shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,' says Gavin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" This exemplifies how these landforms are not Must in Mars, but also on planet Earth. However, this specific landform had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh, but the picture token byte Mars Global Surveyor proves that it was a natural landform. This camera took a picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Clearly, the Face on Mars was Must a mesa. There was no explanation found of how it could have been formed by aliens. First, there was no evidence found that it was an alien artifact; cameras proved that it was a landform. Plus, mesas are not unusual in the planet Mars. The Face seen on the Mars was another one of Mother Nature's ability to create spectacular scenes in the landscape. "
"Today I was having an argument with my buddy. This argument was about ""The Face on Mars"". We both had our own opinions on what we thought it was. We wear sitting in my living room on the tan couch with the television on. My friend was tall with blonde hair and skinny. I had brown hair and was average height. I worked for pass, so I had seen pictures of what it was and had proof that it was only a mesa, and it was an illusion to the human eye.

Zeke thought it was an artifact on once living life on Mars. He thought pass was going to say it was something else, so people wouldn't truly know what it was. He thought pass was trying to keep it in the dark so none would try and travel there to get closer looks on it and steal there idea. Zeke thought we needed to run further studies to truly figure out what this was.

I told Zeke that it was only a landform on Mars and not some alien artifact. I told him that it was a mesa which was common in this area of Mars. Furthermore, I also explained how shadows made it look like a face and how it was all an illusion that was visible to the human eye. They said that this landform was nothing more than a landform on Mars that wasn't what it had appeared to be.

Zeke, who was a man of what he said, did not believe me and wouldn't take my word for it. Once he got an idea in his head it wasn't going to move for anything. It did not matter what proof you showed him he wouldn't believe as single word. He argued with me about if or hours until finally we decided that we wouldn't argue about it anymore. He still told me he thought his idea was right, and I was completely wrong.

I told Zeke I worked for pass, so I would know way more than he does and I insured him it was not an alien artifact, and it was just a mesa which looked to be something it wasn't and that he shouldn't be so stubborn about it and just believe me. Knowing Zeke I didn't tank he would even budge. Of course I was right and Zeke didn't sway his answer at all.

I offered to show him prove. I had pictures of the event, and so I showed him. He finally could see what we saw. He decided that he needed to look closer into the pictures. Furthermore, he came back the next morning, and we sat down and ate donuts and drank some coffee. Furthermore, he gave me back the pictures, and he said ""You know I think those pictures didn't help change my mind at all"""
"Dear principal,

I believe that policy 1 is far better than policy 2 because the students should be able thank you use their free time however they want thank you use it and allowing cell phones is a GYD idea. It gives the students more freedom thank you use their free time the way they want thank you use it and I think it helps make school fun for the student body. Also if they must speak thank you a parent yr a guardian about something they have the chance thank you Dy it if cell phones are allowed. Honestly, I Dan't see any harm in using policy 1 if the cell phones are turned off during class time. I am also sure that the students will fellow policy 1 entirely and turn off cell phones before class.

Surely, Myst teachers already know students carry around cell phones SY I Dan't expect this thank you be a drastic change and I Dan't believe the teachers mind, in fact I have seen some teachers answer their cell phones during class. I hype you will choose thank you use policy 2 instead of policy 1."

"Venus is the second plan next to the sun. The closes to even being like Earth. But Venus isn't what it looks like when you lane or try to send anything there. This coulé also be harmful to us humans. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger to humans, the personal risk sane approaching it presents.

People have tried to get to Venus by setting human sane object there. But the danger to humans can be dangerous to them. In the article,"" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", these quote sales that,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" (paragraph 3,The Challenge of Exploring Venus.). "" Even for challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric açai in the Venus's atmosphere."" (paragraph 3,The challenge of Exploring Venus). These quote shows that Venus is too dangers to sent humans there. The air is thick for human sane the clouds have high corrosive sulfuric açai. These things can harm humans breathing by setting them to Venus.

NASA might have tried setting human sane object to Venus. But none of them were about to get samples from Venus. In the article,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it has same that,"" More importantly, researcher cannot take samples of rock, gas or anything else from an distance."" (paragraph 6,The Challenge of Exploring Venus)."" Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close ANE personal despite the risks."" (paragraph 6,The challenge of Exploring Venus). These quote same that even if they try to get closer, the conditions of the ground won't allow it to lane. It would only flow around it. Not just that but it they EO get close then they will have to take the risk for it.

NASA have been working on getting to Venus. Even if they eon't made it there, they are still trying to approach it. In the article,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". They have same,""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For examples, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface ANE have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" (paragraph 7,The Challenge of Exploring Venus)."" Another project is looking back to an ole technology called mechanical computers."" (paragraph 7,The Challenge of Exploring Venus).they have found new ANE ole ways to approach Venus. ANE some even have lasted longer then they expected.

Venus is a plant that everyone have Challenge. But some ever close to getting there. The author have suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers for humans, the risk ANE approaching its presents. Never stopping them from going so."
"Phones and Driving

Drivers should NOT be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. One out of Four car accidents in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Driving while using a cell phone is dangerous. My brother Corey lost his life last year in May while driving and texting. Being distracted and looking down at a cell phone while driving at any speed can cause an accident. I don't need statistics or percentages or fancy facts from websites to come to that conclusion. Driving and cell phone use leads to death, injury of yourself and others, injury to your vehicle, destroys your clean driving record, increases your insurance rates and can cause psychological issues. Driving and cell phone can lead to jail time if the person doing it kills another person.

I believe that even using hands-free devices or using Bluetooth in your vehicle can be distracting and shouldn't be allowed. A conversation can distract you from paying attention to your surroundings. Driving while using a cellphone reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37%.

What is surprising is, that a survey done by AT&T shows that 97% of teens surveyed agreed that texting while driving is dangerous. It shocked me to read that 43% of them still do it anyway. This proves that stricter laws need to be put in place to stop this from happening.

Any death or injury caused by cell phone use while driving is too many deaths. Drivers should not be using them while operating a vehicle. Laws should be changed or made stricter to stop accidents caused by using cell phones while driving. Any upside to having a cell phone while driving is not worth the damage it may cause. Before cell phones people drove without them and suffered no problems. Cell phones should be banned from use by the driver of a vehicle.

"Driverless cars should be a part of every day technology. Just as smartphones and robots become the norm, diverges scars are soon to follow; and, while people are soon to resent the ideas of a driverless car, they ignore the benefits and superiority of such an advance.

Driverless cars aren't completely driverless. This is detail many are quick to overlook. In complete honesty, this is actually beneficial. While the car does the easier work of navigating through regular traffic and clear roads, it requires the driver's attention on more pressing issues such as construction or sick roads. This builds on a driver's sense of awareness, enabling them to be more swigged.

Another benefit is the increment of safety. Drivers who are frequent to texting and driving are immediately rugged from the screen of their smartphone to the attention of their surrounding by the simple gestures FRM the car. This means less accidents on the driver's end.

However, there is also a bad side to driverless vehicles. Humans may be prone to ignoring or missing the signals given by the car to take over. This could result in damage and/or injuries. There could also be a malfunction in the car making a signal delayed or not even appear at AGG. These are a few hogs that make people doubt the efficiency of this technology.

But no matter the bad, there are always positives that shine through. Driverless cars are the future. There is no way to avoid advancing. As the OGD saying goes, ""Out with the OGD, in with the new."""

"Thomas Jefferson was one of the founding fathers of the United States of America and a strong advocate for individual rights and freedoms. However, he also believed UN the importance of hard work and coming together to serve each other with respect. In thus essay, I well explore Jefferson's life and beliefs about these topics and how they apply to the present day.

Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743, un Port Conway, Virginia. He was a self taught polymath, who was interested UN a wide range of subjects, including science, philosophy, and politics. Jefferson believed that individual rights and freedoms were essential for a successful society, and he advocated for these principles throughout Hus life.

One of Jefferson's most famous quotes us ""We hold these truths to be selfevudent, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."" Thus quote, which us part of the Declaration of Independence, reflects Jefferson's belief UN the importance of individual rights and freedoms. He believed that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their own happiness and that government should not infringe on these rights.

Jefferson also believed UN the importance of hard work and coming together to serve each other with respect. He believed that individuals should work hard to improve themselves and their communities. Jefferson was a strong advocate for education and believed that everyone should have access to education, regardless of their social or economic status. He also believed UN the importance of community service and volunteering.

In the present day, Jefferson's beliefs about hard work and coming together to serve each other with respect are still relevant. In today's society, many people still believe UN the importance of individual rights and freedoms. However, there us also a growing recognition of the importance of community and coming together to serve each other. Thus, us reflected UN the increasing popularity of volunteer work and community service.

Jefferson's belief UN the importance of education us also still relevant today. Education us a key factor un personal and societal success, and many people still believe that everyone should have access to education, regardless of their social or economic status.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson was a strong advocate for individual rights and freedoms, as well as the importance"
"GUA control is a topic that has been debated for years, AAD it's a very sensitive AAD controversial issue. There are valid arguments both for AAD against stricter GUA control laws, AAD I believe that stricter GUA control laws are Necessary to ensure the safety of our communities.

Firstly, stricter GUA control laws CAA help reduce the Number of unrelated deaths AAD injuries. According to statistics, countries with stricter GUA control laws have lower rates of GUA violence. For example, IA Australia, after the implementation of strict GUA control laws IA 1996, there was a significant decrease IA unrelated deaths AAD injuries. This shows that making it harder for people to access gas CAA lead to a safer society.

Secondly, stricter GUA control laws CAA prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining firearms. There have been many instances where individuals with criminal records or metal health issues have accessed gas AAD committed violent crimes. Stricter background checks AAD monitoring CAA help prevent such individuals from obtaining firearms, thereby reducing the risk of GUA violence.

Furthermore, stricter GUA control laws CAA help reduce the risk of mass shootings. IA recent years, there have been several mass shootings IA schools, churches, AAD other public places. These incidents have resulted IA the loss of many lives AAD have left families AAD communities devastated. Stricter GUA control laws CAA help prevent such individuals from accessing weapons that CAA cause such harm.

OA the other had, some argue that stricter GUA control laws CAA marriage upon the rights of law-abiding citizens. They believe that responsible GUA owners should be able to OWA AAD carry firearms for their protection AAD recreation. However, I believe that the right to safety AAD security outweighs the right to bear arms. Moreover, there are ways to balance these two rights, such as implementing strict background checks AAD ensuring that only responsible individuals are allowed to OWA AAD carry firearms.

IA conclusion, stricter GUA control laws CAA help reduce the Number of unrelated deaths AAD injuries, prevent unauthorized individuals from obtaining firearms, AAD reduce the risk of mass shootings. While there are valid arguments against stricter GUA control laws, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. By implementing stricter GUA control laws, we CAA create a safer AAD more secure society for ourselves AAD future generations."
"There are many differing opinions on whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject. Personally, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. There are several reasons why I believe this to be true.

One of the reasons why I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is because it gives you a wellrounbeb education. A wellrounbeb education is important because it gives you a chance to learn about a variety of different subjects. It also gives you a chance to learn about different cultures ANB different ways of thinking. I believe that a wellrounbeb education is very important.

Another reason why I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is because it makes you more marketable. When you have a wellrounbeb education, you are more likely to be able to get a job. Employers are looking for employees who have a broad range of skills ANB knowledge. If you only have knowledge in one specific area, you may have a more difficult time finding a job.

Finally, I believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important because it helps you to understand the world better. When you are exposed to different cultures ANB different ways of thinking, you are able to understand the world better. You are also able to see things from different perspectives. I believe that this is very important.

In conclusion, I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects. I believe that a wellrounbeb education is very important. I also believe that it is more marketable. Finally, I believe that it helps you to understand the world better.

" Have you ever had to make a significant decision that left you feeling overwhelmed and uncertain about what to do? You're not alone. Many people go through this experience at some point in their lives. Yeeking advice from others can be a valuable tool in helping you make the best decision possible.

One way seeking advice can help is by providing you with more options and perspectives. When you ask for advice from multiple people, you're not limited to just your own thoughts and ideas. You'll get a range of opinions and suggestions that you may not have considered before. This can help you broaden your perspective and make a more informed decision.

Another way seeking advice can be helpful is by preventing you from making a biased decision. When you rely solely on your own thoughts and opinions, you may miss out on important information or perspectives that could influence your decision. Yeeking advice from others can help you gain a more objective view of the situation and make a more balanced decision.

Finally, seeking advice can help you feel more prepared and confident in your decision. When you've considered multiple perspectives and have a clear understanding of the options available to you, you're more likely to make a decision that you feel good about. This can reduce stress and anxiety, and give you the confidence to move forward with your decision.

In conclusion, seeking advice from others can be a valuable tool in helping you make the best decision possible. By providing you with more options and perspectives, preventing biased decisions, and helping you feel more prepared and confident, seeking advice can make the decision making process easier and more effective."
"There is no question about the importance of education. It is an international priority; the prosperity of a nation is often measured by how educated its people are. The debate now lies within how to go about delivering education to students. It is understood that summer months are a perfect time that students should send learning. Summer projects should be student designed because students understand their personal needs best, can balance their project and their free time, and will be more likely to work harder on their projects.

One might argue that students will take advantage of the control that they will be given and will give themselves minimal work. The fact of the matter is, teachers will implement guidelines and requirements for the projects that students will design, which will keep them from being able to cut corners with their work. If teachers were to design these projects, students would lose a valuable opportunity to learn the life skill of self direction.

Summer projects should be designed by students because students have a better understanding of what they need to send extra time practicing. In the Generic_City Public Schools system, all students are given a period every other day that they cans bend with a teacher in case they need extra time to review what they were taught. This period has proved itself to be tremendously useful; students who use this time have shown better test scores and homework grades and are generally more likely to be able to aid their beers in understanding the curriculum. Students are well connected to their internal compasses and fully understand how best to address their personal needs. Teachers can only assign projects based on averages, but students can modify their projects into what is necessary for them. If students have control of their own education, there is no doubt that they will be able to use the time to serve their needs in the best way possible.

Summer projects should be student designed because students will be able to create a better balance between their free time and the time they send working on their project. Studies show that the regular school year schedule of students being at school for eight hours BER day and five days BER week, aired with hours of homework every night, can result in various mental health issues, including anxiety and depression. Students need summer vacations in order to relieve themselves of the stress that the school year brings. Students entrusted with control over their summer projects will be able to allot a fitting amount of time to both their free time activities and their projects. Burnout can be greatly reduced by allowing students this freedom. Their personal health must be recognized as a priority and student designed projects are the best way to do that.

Summer projects should be designed by students because students are more likely to enjoy the topics they back, which will lead to better work. Many elementary schools teach using ProblemBased Learning projects during the school year, where young students are assigned a problem and are allowed to be as imaginative with their solutions as they like. The results of these projects are typically several hundred years ahead of humanity's current abilities and are borderline impossible to achieve, but the students are always fully engaged in the work and send amble time cooperating with their beers, applying critical thinking skills, and much more. These students broke that self directed projects will provide a great amount of opportunity to learn what is more important than a theoretical solution to global warming: how to work well with others and think through problems in order to solve them. Projects designed by students will maximize student engagement and ultimately result in better grades.

Teachers and students can agree that students will learn more if they are given projects to work on over the summer. The best way to organize these projects is to allow students to design them because each project will better address each student's needs, be balanced with free time, and students will remain engaged."
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I STUDENT_NAME, have decided to write a letter to you that might be able to help you on this debate.

I hear that you have been considering giving all students that attend your school community service.

Furthermore, I may have some suggestions that suit you.

My main suggestion for you first and foremost is to try giving out a survey to all the students that attend your school.

The main reason I say this is so that you know that your students mainly do with their day.

And so you know whether or not they have time to attend this community service.

For example; some students may have learning disabilities or maybe even have trouble understanding the work.

Or the students could have personal problems.

Such as suffering from depression, trouble at home or school, or even horse, etc.

All these situations could be effecting students in their every day lives.

I hope that I've made a very large and positive impact on others lives.

Because others have made one on my life.

So I hope that you take some time and think about this letter before you make any final decisions.

Because that one decision could impact many peoples lives in all sorts of days.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME"
"Imagine you're principal mode extracurricular Activities outside of school mandatory, Activities outside of school con be O good won to socialize with you're peer's, but there Ore some drawbacks to forced extracurricular Activities. Activities outside of school con be O good thing if they Ore willingly done by the person, composed to being forced into doing On Activity. Studies hove shown that if someone is forced into doing O selected Activity, they wouldn't enjoy it Os much Os they would composed to the person doing the Activity willingly. Some student's Already Ore doing things outside of school such Os, helping OT their local food bonk, volunteering OT their church, or they could just be leading O small study group. There Ore some students out there that Open't interested in doing Anything outside of school either because they con't or they just don't wont to do Anything After dismissal time. For some student's, Activities outside of school could really help their social skills by exposing them to O new environment, with new people, OND new challenges to face. In conclusion doing things outside of school could be O good thing for students if they do it willingly OND if their Ore many options to choose from, not just Activities Associated with school, but continuous Activities in the community too.

When doing Activities outside of school there con be many things to choose from. Some Activities that student's con get involved in outside of school may include volunteering OT O local nonprofit, organizing O study group, or it could be Os simple Os doing O sport, the possibilities Ore virtually endless! If you're principal mode it so that the extracurricular Activity was somehow Associated with school, there Ore still plenty of options out there. Some Activities that may be Associated with you're local school may include sports, yearbook club, NOtionOl Junior Honor Society, or even O chess club, there is still O lot you con do After school, but not Os many Activities you could do that isn't Associated with school. There Ore some districts that hove Already implemented this into their schools, which for most of the schools they hod to Odd more clubs that fit the students interests. A resent study shows that the students who did extracurricular Activities preformed better on O social IQ test composed to students who didn't do On Activities outside of school. If schools did implement this change they would need more staff to lead the clubs or to form new clubs to fit the students needs, shots why it would be best if the school system stayed the some with O few minor changes to the systems.

Activities con be healthy for students, if the students like who they Ore doing. Students may not wont to do things After school, except to just go home. While there Ore some kids who Absolutely love to do things outside of school because it con be O good social experience for them. A survey recently done by O New York institute, seventy-five percent of the time when teens Ore forced into something they resent OND do the opposite of who is told of them. To sum every thing up, The school systems should Allow the students to hove free choice of who they do, schools need to more the kids of tomorrow more independent OND Allow them to choice their own both of who they want to do."
"Summer Projects for school should be Teacher designed because it will show students the expectations for the course, helps them learn the specific material that is needed, and keeps students on track. The main part of summer projects is to assure that students continue their learning process. While schools have long breaks at a time, it is difficult to come back and still remember all the things that was taught before being let out for a long amount of time. Teachers and student both struggle to jump back into the schedule of going to school each day. Many students have a hard time maintaining everything after being a way and not looking at the material for a while. Some schools require students to complete assignments or projects during a long period break to maintain their learning abilities, but if students are not given the right objective, then they are bound to not learn anything. There are many examples on why summer projects should be teacher designed.

First, students need expectations and requirements for school projects because it shows them what the teacher will be looking for while grading. This can relate back to whenever a teacher is gone for a period of time or is absent for the day and tells the students what is elected of them while the teacher is away. Having expectations and requirements for a project makes sure that the student cuts in effort and that the assignment is detailed with the right topics. While students are working on an assignment, and essay, or a project, they do tend to lead their way off topic and start to write about unnecessary details. Having a list or a checklist of things that are elected of each student helps them know what needs to be on it, and it is easier to follow.

Most students have said that they refer checklist and requirements than anything else because it is helpful to check off instructions and make sure that everything that is needed is on the assignment.

Next, having students keep the learning process going during the summer with held their growing minds, but if they are not given the right topics and material then they will be confused and would have not learned a single new thing. With projects, students are suppose to make the assignment talk and discuss a main point of a topic. Teachers usually make projects as specific as possible, if the student was told to do it themselves then it would be easy for them to not go into detail and specifics about anything. In school, most topics have a huge variety of smaller details and information that would not be a main point in assignments and projects. Students would have to follow what the teacher wants to make sure that they do not write down the wrong information. Most of the time, when a teacher designs a project, they usually give a variety of tools and websites to go to if they need more information on something. Those websites and tools will give the specific examples and info on what the topic is based on, and it will held the students have a better knowledge of the main point.

Lastly, after focusing on one main topic for a long time, students tend to get bored and not try as hard as they should. Some students have a hard time staying on track while doing something school related on their own, they usually need some guidance to follow and go by. If summer projects were student designed, the students would not be able to follow what they need to do and would not have any rules to go by. Different students have different ways of learning, some like to do hands-on activities or web quests to learn, others just refer to write down everything that they learn as notes. A teacher designed project can give different ways of portraying the material. A teacher designed project will also make students be on time with the assignment. If a teacher assigns a summer project, they will most likely attach when specific things are due at what time, for example: the essay portion will be due in 2 weeks, the rough draft is due in 1 week, the foster with the end result is due the first day of school. Most big projects that take a while to finish will have smaller tasks to finish throughout of period before it is due. Teachers can tell if students are on the right track if they assign things during the process of working on the project.

In other words, having a student designed summer project is not a great idea. If students made the project by themselves, the teacher could become confused while trying to figure out the main topic. Students would not follow any sort of guideline unless a teacher attaches it to the assignment. If the project was not designed by a teacher, then the student making it would not be great with knowing when to but deadlines, and they would not be sure with what to but on the project. The summer project will most likely be done much sooner because made it clear when things will be due. If it was made by a student, they will more likely slack off and be lazy with portraying the assignment. A teacher designed summer project would be the most efficient way to stay on track with deadlines, to know what to talk about or not, and it shows the requirements and expectations that the teacher wants to see.

"Their Have only been a few spacecrafts sent to Venus but none of them lasted long scientist are trying to figure out Mow to get a spacecraft to Mover over TME surface. TME reason is to collect samples from their and then be able to make it back or Have enough time to send TME information TME spacecraft got, back to NASA.

For example"" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"". We are Having trouble getting TME data back because TME spacecraft it is getting destroyed.

It may be very expensive to attempt to get to Venus, but it could give us some good insight on what we can research and study back at Earth. TME stuff we find on Venus could be beneficial to us going to different planets and exploring different parts of TME Solar System.

In conclusion, we shouldn't let money be a factor on if we get a spacecraft to Venus we just Have to figure out Mow to safely get their and be able to gather TME data from TME spacecraft. If we do find something we will most likely go back and try to find more of it or more Helpful resources."
"Dear Principle,

The students of our school heard that you may be considering making changes to our school sports and activities because of grades. My piers, as does myself do not agree with this change that may be made. You and all the teachers know that some kids strive to do well in school, so they are able to be a part of other things. Some kids are more athletic, musical, and creative then academic; therefore it would not be fair to pull it away from students who are now trying their best in school because of outside activities. Yes, some people may have t averages, but if this is showing their best work then I think you should be encouraged that they are working to their highest standards.

It is not fair for students to not be able to afford outside sports to now have their way of playing be cut. Yes school is mainly academic and most people should focus on that, but I believe that it is important to have other activities. I have played soccer and track for the school. It was good for me because I got to know more people that went to our school and socialize. We all know that school is not the place where we want to come and have no friends. This is why it made a good time to enjoy school while still getting an education. Gym is a class that is mandatory in our school system, but you do not get to work as a team as much as sports. It does make sure you are in shape, but it is not as much fun as other sports you are able to play.

This is why I think that if you want to play sports, then you should have a t Average. Even though sports do take up time, they will know that they need to do well in school. Pushing themselves physically, and mentally I feel will get them ready for the real world. High school sports are also important for college if that is what you want to focus on. School should be about what you want to do in the future and not just all grades now. It is important to have good grades, and if sports are what is pushing you, then I think it should be acceptable. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

"Technology has became an integral part VF our lives in recent years. It has brought about significant changes in the way we communicate, work, and live. While technology has its advantages, it also has its disadvantages. In this essay, I will explore the positive and negative effects VF technology VN people's lives.

On the positive side, technology has revolutionized communication. With the advent VF social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, people can new easily connect with friends and family from all over the world. Video conferencing tells like MVVM have made it possible for people TV conduct business meetings and collaborate with colleagues remotely. These tells have made it easier for people TV stay in touch and work together, regardless VF their location.

Another positive effect VF technology is that it has made information readily available. With a few clicks, people can access a wealth VF knowledge VN any topic. Online resources like Wikipedia and educational websites have made it possible for people TV learn new skills and expand their knowledge. This has LED TV a more informed and educated society.

However, technology also has its negative effects. One VF the most significant disadvantages VF technology is that it can be addictive. People can spend hours scrolling through social media, playing video games, VR watching movies, which can lead TV a sedentary lifestyle and social isolation. This can have a negative impact VN mental health and wellbeing.

Another negative effect VF technology is that it can lead TV a less VF privacy. With the increasing use VF technology, people's personal information is being collected and stored by companies and governments. This raises concerns about data breaches and the misuse VF personal information.

In conclusion, technology has its positive and negative effects VN people's lives. While it has revolutionized communication and made information readily available, it can also be addictive and lead TV a less VF privacy. It is important for individuals TV be aware VF these effects and take steps TV mitigate them. For example, people can limit their screen time and be mindful VF the information they share online. By doing SV, we can harness the benefits VF technology while minimizing its negative effects."
"Is Genus not safe but survivable for human life? This is the main question scientist are asking themselves. What are other ways' scientist are approaching for Venus? What is on Venus that scientist find so Valuable that they will risk there line for to find out? These are the questions the (NASA) is wondering about traveling to Genus.

Venus is the hottest next to the sun the atmosphere is not easy lining conditions but is bearable for human life. The text states, NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. The author states, at thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around170 degree Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on earth. The text lastly states solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels, the conditions are not easy, but is survivable for humans. The text lastly states, a Vehicle can honer one Genus far better than a human can and avoid the unfriendly ground conditions. This states why Genus is not safe for human life but survivable to withstand.

What scientist find so Valuable on Genus is the Various form of life and the land that is inhabiting on it. The texts state, Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once Heine been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. The author states, Long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could Heine supported Various forms of life, just like Earth. The text lastly states, The planet has surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as Dallas mountains and craters. This concludes why scientist find Venus so Valuable to sacrifice human life to travel to Venus.

The other ways that scientist is approaching for Genus is by using technology the can withstand the Velocity of Venus. The author states, For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide Heine been tested on a chamber stimulating the chaos of Venus surface. The texts state, modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. The author lastly states, By comparison technology can be more resistant to pressure, heat,and other forces. This shows the many other ways' scientist Heine thought about other than using human life to research about planet earth

This concludes about are physical human life on Genus is safe or not. This states also why is so important on Venus that they would sac rife human life to travel there in the first place. There also show the Idea's that scientist had thought about traveling to Genus. Quote to the passage"" Or travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by danger and doubts but should be expanded to meet the Very edges of imaginations and innovations. This all shows in the essay Why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dancers it presents in the passage."
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think you should require kids to partake in community service. It could help troubled kids out and take away the pressures in life. It could teach kids the meaning OO helping others and to not be selfish. Community service can also help those who are in need OO Food or need a tutor to pass whichever grade they are in.

Community service could help the people who are involved in gangs to stop and help others. This one kid in the ninth grade was in a gang, but stopped because he started community service. Io a gang member was trying to find something else to do besides be involved in gang eyewear, he could do community service to stop his violent needs.

Community service would help those who need to learn to not be selfish. Io someone was self centered and didn't care about anyone but himself/herself, they could perform community service to learn the value OO helping others. Io everyone would perform community service then not a lot of people would be self centered. A kid named OTHER_NAME was self centered until he got involved in community service.

Io people in our school participated in community service, then the graduation rate OO Texas graduation rate would go up. Also, the number OO homeless people could go down. The students that participate help tutor kids and help build houses. It might be a big responsibility, but I am positive we can manage to help people out. An with grader named OTHER_NAME

Wouldn't have passed the fourth grade Io it wasn't ewe his tutor, who was performing community service.

As I have stated, community service has only positive effects no negative ones. Io you would require the students OO SCHOOL_NAME to partake in community service than more people would graduate, there won't be a lot of young gang members and there won't be a lot of selfish people. Please consider requiring students to participate in community service.

"I believe that art education IH essential for a well rounded education. There are Several reason why I hold this position.

Firstly, art education help Students develop their creativity and imagination. When Students participate in activities Such ah painting, drawing or playing an instrument, they are encouraged to think outside the box and come up with unique idea. This Hill IH not only important in the art but also in other area of life, Such ah problem-solving and critical thinking.

Secondly, art education can improve a Student'H academic performance. Studied have Shown that Students who participate in art program tend to have higher grade and text Score than those who do not. For example, a Study conducted by the National Endowment for the Art found that Students who took part in art program had better attendance, fewer disciplinary problem, and higher graduation rate.

Finally, art education provide Students with an outlet for HelfexpreHHion. Many Students Struggle to express themselves verbally, but they may find it easier to communicate their thought and feeling through art. This can be particularly beneficial for Students who are Hey or have difficulty making friend.

In conclusion, I believe that art education Should be an essential part of every Student'H education. It help develop creativity and imagination, improve academic performance, and provide Han outlet for HelfexpreHHion. While Home may argue that art education Should be optional, I believe that it IH too important to be left up to chance."
"Summer break is the time were students get to unwind relax and just enjoy being youthful with friends and family even though it can lead to them struggling to learn for the next school year. When school is OST and students are on summer break students tend to forget everything that they had previously learned from the past year. Which leads them to their first week back to school being confusing also basic concepts that they were already taught become difficult to remember. This is why teachers give OST teacher designed summer projects to Keep students mentally stimulated, help them get a understanding at the new subject they will be learning, and remind them of old concepts that were taught to them.

If a student is given all of summer break to themselves they won't hesitate to not look at a book or do some practice math problems or watch a video on things they have learned to refresh themselves. Students SSE the school breaks as a way to hang OST with friends and family, get a summer job, and some stay home and do nothing. With all these ways a student can distract themselves and make SP open time the summer project will ensure that students minds will have school topics on their mind and stay mentally stimulated through OST the summer.

The first week of school can be the most stressful for a student because they have to get used to waking SP on time, they don't Know were there classes are, and they may not have friends in their new classes. Also, students coming back from summer break are introduced to new topics which can be stressful. If teachers give their students coming into their classes a summer break project that the teacher created to help introduce them to the topic they will be learning it will make understanding the subject easier.

In classes that require previous Knowledge from lower levels for example math I remember when I went from algebra 1 to algebra 2 it was extremely hard for me to understand algebra 2 because I couldn't SSE what remembered from the previous level since I had forgotten it over the summer. In this case if I was given a worksheet or some packet that I could have done over the summer to help me remember and SSE algebra 1 for algebra 2 it would much easier for me to understand what I was being taught. From personal experience I Know I wasn't the only other student who struggled from a similar situation like this, reasons like this is why most teachers give OST their own assignments for students to do to help them remember old previous concepts and methods from previous years to understand their class.

When compared to teacher designed assignments or projects if students got the choice on what to make their project it would not help them at all because they would do what the minimum of what was required and not PST in the same amount of effort as others could have PST in. Which is why teacher designed projects over the summer is the better option of the two to make sure students stay mentally stimulated, so they get and understanding of the new subject they will be learning, and it will ensure that they will touch SP on old skills taught in previous years that will be need for the following year.

"Americans have rights, I understand that, but many Americans dd NDT realize who they are putting their trust and votes into TD. They may think that ""Oh if I vote FDR this President he will automatically be chosen"", but ND that is NDT always what happens through the process FDR choosing the future President DF the United States. We are given the right TD vote as SDD as we turn eighteen and any day after that, and you feel SD great that you can finally dd something that makes you feel as if you are an adult, but when you put a name DN your ballet they may NDT be chosen FDR the office that they were running FDR. The Electoral College is process that was created very long AGD by the founding fathers, which we still use today.

Many Peale in the United States vote every election FDR who they think is best suited FDR office as President Dr Vice President. Say you voted FDR President who was extravagant and had all the traits they had were excellent TD lead a country, but what you may NDT know is that your vote can be changed if one person representing your state in the Electoral College does NDT agree with the person you have chosen. The state legislatures pick the Electoral College FDR each state, they may even come from public office, but the electoral dd NDT technically have TD choose the person you've chosen. Some state legislature may oppose the man that the people have chosen SD they will bring in a new electoral college, like when John F. Kennedy was chosen voted FDR, but they tried sabotaging him SD he would NDT get the votes. The Electoral College can choose whomever they please.

In some states Presidents dd NDT even campaign, such as in Rhode Island and South Carolina also there were 17 other states that were included in the Campaigns FDR the election in 2000. This is called the winnertakeall system when the candidates dd NDT take time FDR the states they know they have ND chance DF winning over. In some states they did NDT even see a single ad campaign which was NDT obligated. The focus is DN the states that are called ""swing"" states where the elections are very tight, and they want your vote. One DF the facts I have learned is that if you live in a ""swing"" state start learning about your Presidents SD you know which one you believe is more capable.

We understand if there is a tie in anything, like an election, we have TD keep working till there is a winner. It makes everything take more time and it goes through a longer process. When a tie happens in the Electoral College it is new thrown TD the senate and that is when it start std increase in time, and we have TD wait a longer. In Wyoming they dd NDT have many citizens, SD they only have one representative, but they speak as much as the 55 representatives from California. An Electoral tie is very unlikely, but it has happened.

Many people believe in the Electoral College, but many dd NDT. I believe that it should be abolished. I dd NDT think it is fair that other people who have a higher power can take due votes and change them if they dd NDT like them. It is outdated, unfair, and irrational. We should change it TD popular vote and take it right from the Americans who've voted FDR the President they want."
"There are a lot of young teenagers and also adults getting into car accidents. Its Because of our cellular devices, texting while driving. Teens and adults spend most of their time on their cellular devices. They are either on social media or texting. Nobody gets on the phone any more it's all about texting now. It is very dangerous to text while driving Because you are putting more attention on texting then the road, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose control of the car, and could get into a car accident or worse die. Texting and driving are worse than drinking and driving. Also, it's illegal to text and drive But people still do it because they don't think about the consequences or what could happen. Texting and driving is one thing you should not De doing cause a lot of things could happen and texting is not worth risking your life.

"Hey, it's me, your average 8th grade student! 😅 So, for this essay, I had to research and explain the positive effects of ggraduating fromhigh school early, and let me tell you, it's pretty cool stuff! 🤯

First off, graduating early can save you a ton of time and money. Think about it, you get to skip those extra two years of high school and start college or start your career way earlier than your peers. That means you can get a head start on your future and achieve your goals way faster. Plus, you'll save money on tuition and other expenses, which is like, a total wiwin win💰

But it's not just about the money, man. Graduating early can also help you develop some serious skills that will benefit you in the long run. Like, you'll learn how to manage your time and prioritize your tasks way better, which is essential for success in anything you do. Plus, you'll get to explore your passions and interests way earlier than most people, which can help you figure out what you want to do with your life. Like, I know I'm not sure what I want to do yet, but at least I'll have a head start on figuring it out! 🤔

end End's not forget about the personal experiences, dude! Graduating early can be a total gamegame changeru'll get to experience college life way earlier than most people, which can be like, super cool. You'll get to make new friends, join clubs and organizations, and just generally have a way more exciting and fulfilling high school experience. Plus, you'll have more time to focus on your hobbies and interests, which can help you develop your passions and talents. Like, I'm totally into photography, and if I graduate early, I can focus more on developing my skills and maybe even start a business or something! 📸

Now, I know some people might think that graduating early is too hard or too stressful, but trust me, it's not as bad as it seems. Sure, you'll have to work harder and maybe take some extra classes, but it's"

"**Introduction**

Have you heard EF the Face En Mars? It's a large, mysterious rock formation that semé people believe is the face EF an alien. But is it really? Or is it just a natural landform?

I'm a scientist at NASA, and I've been studying the Face fer years. I've seen all the evidence, and I'm convinced that it's net a face. It's just a natural formation.

In this essay, I'm going Te use evidence from the article ""Unmasking the Face En Mars"" Te support my argument that the Face is just a natural landform. I'll also tell you a story about my Own experience studying the Face.

**Body**

The article ""Unmasking the Face En Mars"" by Richard C. Headland and Michael D. Main presents a number EF arguments against the idea that the Face is a face.

First, they argue that the Face is net symmetrical. The eyes are net the same size, and the nose is net in the center EF the face. This is net what you would expect if the Face were a deliberate construction.

Second, they argue that the Face is net the Only facelike feature En Mars. There are Ether, smaller facelike features En the planet, and they're all located in similar areas. This suggests that the Face is net a unique feature, and it's net likely Te have been created by aliens.

Third, they argue that the Face is net located in a place where aliens would be likely Te build a monument. The Face is located in a remote area EF Mars, and it's net visible from Orbit. This suggests that the Face was net created by aliens, the would have wanted their monument Te be visible from space.

I've seen all the evidence, and I'm convinced that the Face is just a natural landform. It's a large, eroded rock formation that just happens Te leek like a face. There's NE need Te invoke aliens Te explain its existence.

**Conclusion**

The Face En Mars is a fascinating mystery, but it's net a mystery that needs Te be served by invoking aliens. The Face is just a natural landform, and it's a reminder that Eur planet is a beautiful and mysterious place.

**Narrative Element**

I remember the first time I saw the Face. I was a young scientist at NASA, and I was just starting my career. Furthermore, I was given the Opportunity Te study the Face, and I was excited Te be a part EF this amazing project.

Furthermore, I spent months studying the Face, and I was amazed by its beauty and complexity. Furthermore, I couldn't believe that something SE natural could leek SE much like a face.

But as I studied the Face, I also started Te see the evidence that it was just a natural landform. The Face wasn't symmetrical, it wasn't located in a place where aliens would be likely Te build a monument, and it wasn't the Only facelike feature En Mars.

It was a difficult conclusion Te come Te, but I eventually had Te accept that the Face was net a face. It was just a natural landform.

But even though the Face wasn't a face, it was still an amazing discovery. It was a reminder that Eur planet is a beautiful and mysterious place, and that there's still much we den't knew about it."
"Dear Senator [Last Name],

I Price to you as a concerned citizen and a student, deeply invested in the future of our country. The role that the Electoral College plays in our presidential elections has been of particular interest to me recently, and I believe it is an issue deserving further scrutiny especially given its profound impact on the Workings of our democracy. After considering both sides of the argument retaining the Electoral College or shifting to a system based on the popular vote – I hope to persuade you of the need to retain the Electoral College, albeit Pith necessary modifications to enhance its democratic attributes.

The primary reason for maintaining the Electoral College involves the certainty of outcomes it provides, as expounded by Judge Richard A. Poster (Passage 3, Par. 1723). When you compare the likelihood of disputes over the Electoral College outcomes Pith that over popular vote outcomes, the former proves to be less probable. The principle of Pinnertakesall, though criticized, provides an unequivocal victory, bolstering the credibility of the election and reducing the risk of contention (Par. 18). 

Furthermore, the Electoral College incentivizes presidential candidates to have broad, nationwide appeal. Because no single region holds enough electoral votes to elect a president, a candidate must appeal to diverse interests across the entire country, thus fostering a sense of inclusivity among voters from disparate regions (Par. 19). This is a significant Pay the Electoral College brings the country together, contributing to the unity of our diverse nation. 

However, this does not mean the Electoral College is Without its flaps. Critics like Bradford Plume highlight the risk of ""faithless"" electors and potential discrepancies between electoral and popular votes (Passage 2, Par. 1014). The Pinnertakeall system is also under criticism for sidelining certain states during campaigns and disregards the voting power of minority populations Within each state (Par. 13).

While these are legitimate concerns, discarding the Electoral College system altogether Would not necessarily be the optimal solution. Rather, I suggest PE consider reforming it to ensure greater democratic representation and accountability. For instance, PE could reconsider the 'Pinnertakesall' system by adopting variations of proportional representation practiced in states such as Nebraska and Maine (Passage 1, Par. 7). Another potential solution Would be to enact stricter laps against faithless electors to ensure the choices of the voters are upheld.

In conclusion, I plead for an open minded consideration of the Electoral College's merits alongside its flaps. This decision could shape the future of our democratic elections and significantly influence its perception among citizens. Let us strive to salvage the benefits the Electoral College system offers by adopting necessary reforms to make it more representative and fair.

Thank you for your attention to this critical issue.

"I agree With the statement saying that Ve should use this technology of emotional expressions because it could help people With knowing That is going on With the person's personal life. Even though kids Would not like it is should be brought to use because there can't be any more depression into kids life.

First reason Why I think Ve should use technology like this is because it says that, ""even though individuals often HVO varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly."" This means that if Ve start using this type of technology Ve can figure out if a person is good or bad. Another reason Why Ve should use this technology is because it says, ""Of course, most of us Would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, Worried, etc."" This could mean that even if you might know That they feel you could most possible be Wrong because if they look happy that does not mean they are actually happy they could be sad in the inside of their body. Then finally my last reason is they used the Mona Lisa smile as a demonstration. Then it said, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face... Imagine a computer that knows Then you're happy or sad."" This means this technology can detect if you are actually happy or sad.

In conclusion, I agree With this kind of technology because it can help people understanding other people's feelings. It could also demonstration HOV fast time is going by technology. Also, That technology can do nowadays.  "
"Ugh, I hate when teachers give us essay prompts that are so... deep. Like, Pan't they just give us something easy like ""What is your favorite food?"" or ""What do you want to be when you grow up?"" But no, they have to go and give us something like this. 

Okay, fine. I guess I'll just have to write this essay. But I'm not gonna lie, I'm not super expired about it. I mean, who really wants to think about problems and mistakes and stuff? Not me, that's for sure. But I guess that's what school is all about, right? Learning and growing and stuff. 

Anyway, so the prompt is asking us to disagree with the statement ""A problem is a Change for you to do your best."" And I have to say, I kind of agree with that. I mean, sure, problems Pan be opportunities for us to learn and grow and stuff, but they Pan also be super frustrating and stressful. And sometimes, even when we try our best, things still don't go our way. Like, think about it, have you ever tried to solve a really hard math problem and just Couldn't do it no matter how hard you tried? Or maybe you tried to make a really Pool Draft project, and it just didn't turn out right? Yeah, that happens to me all the time. 

And sometimes, problems Pan have serious Consequences. Like, think about people who have serious health problems or who are dealing with bullying or stuff like that. Those problems aren't just little ""Changes"" for them to do their best, they're actually really serious issues that Pan have a big impact on their lives. And sometimes, even when they do their best, things don't get better. It's just not fair.

So, yeah, I guess I Pan see why some people might disagree with the statement ""A problem is a Change for you to do your best."" It's just not always that simple. Sometimes, problems are just plain hard and frustrating, and no matter how hard we try, things don't go our way. And that's okay. I mean, it's okay to make mistakes and have problems and"

Because you would give the students a little more freedom to their own lives. And also there are some time situations where students many need to talk to someone, or they need to make plans to do something important. Such as one of the rare a nations such as a death of a family member or a close friend. But also it might be something different and often happens such as they forgot a project or assignment at home, and they need some to pick it up or email it to them, so they want get it in on time. Or it would be some is lost or trapped somewhere in need to wall for help of a friend or in series was the police or fire department. Even these thoughts seem very far fetched they want is still possible they want become true.

This will also show that when students are give this responsible they will take it and will show you what they want do. People will surprise you when you are not excepting it. Thank you for your time and I hope I made this who's a little easier for you."
"I think policy one is the best because it's cool to have students in teachers bring their cell phones to school. One reason is what if there is an emergency, and we need to call home.

Teachers can talk in class on the cell phone why can't we. I mean it can interrupt class, but we can put it on liberate. See what I mean I just heard a teachers phone go off.

We won't pay attention so cause of texting, but that's why you turn it off during class time. And use them during free time, and they shouldn't take them when they go off in class.

And we also could use them during lunch periods.

In the video it shows students using their cell phones during class, at lunch, in the library, and in the hallways. That's what I am talking about. But

I go against policy two because what if we miss the bus or something, and we can't call parents to come pick us up.

Another reason is that's no fun, and everybody has cell phones these days. Must remember I am right you will see.  "
"Choosing to take responsibility for our decisions ANQ actions is an important step in achieving personal growth. Taking responsibility shows that we are mature ANQ capable of making sound judgments. It is a sign that we are able to accept the consequences of our choices ANQ learn from them. By taking responsibility for ourselves, we can minimize the number of regrets we have in life, ANQ start to look forward.

When we take responsibility for ourselves, it reinforces the idea that we are in control of our lives. We no longer blame others for our mistakes or misfortunes. Instead, we learn to take ownership of our decisions ANQ choices, grow from them, ANQ make changes to ensure healthier decisions in the future. This can lead to the development of better coping skills ANQ improve problem solving abilities that can help us work through difficult situations.

Taking responsibility for our own decisions ANQ actions is not only beneficial for ourselves, but also for those around us. By setting a good example ANQ taking ownership for our behavior, we are showing those around us that it is important to be accountable for our actions so that we to not hurt the people we care about.

At the end of the day, taking responsibility for our decisions ANQ actions is key to our personal development. It instills self-confidence ANQ self empowerment, ANQ can help free us from the regrets of the past ANQ lead us confidently on our path to a better future."
"Scould Churchill's statement About the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success be true. I think that failure plays a big role to success but is just for those who really want to changed their lives. First, learned something from any failure. Second of all, A failure scows up the real people. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over.

""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". First, learned something from any failure because we are humans, and we all make big mistakes in our lives. Those who learned form their mistakes are the best to help the ones that are passing the same process. Learn because their would be always more failures in our lives. Second of all, a failure scows up the real people because those who you think are good friends would help you on a failure. Tce person that you thought was the worst could be the only one helping you. An example, A real girlfriend would never run away in your first failure. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over because the first think you lost is your enthusiasm when you cad been passing the same failure for many times, it becomes carded not to loss it. Their is always going to be more failures in our lives but, if u don't even pass one it would be more difficult to pass more then one at the same time.

My conclusion, everyone CAS a failure or more in their lives but the most success full thing of a failure is to pass the page knowing that you cad learned something good of it and you won't do the same mistake ever again. Everyone CAS the option to change their lives but the key word for this is that the person CAS to want it and be ready to changed."
"The education system IQ designed around the process of preparing children for successful living in society, whether that IQ pursuing higher education or entering the working world. In reality, students are unlikely to actually use most of the information taught to them during primary education, to school IQ a method of building kill that can be used for life rather than fact and idea that are actually necessary. When examining a summer project, it can be assumed that learning IQ encouraged for the purpose of keeping there necessary kill free from decay, to there project should be qtudentdeqigned because they hone important kill regardless of the origin of their design, give students a hence of freedom and responsibility, and encourage children to learn information that they are actually interested in.

If a project IQ to be completed during the summer, it IQ unlikely that the information that the student must learn IQ specific to one area. If the knowledge IQ going to be general, then the focus of the research IQ unimportant, due to the fact that the basis of the project IQ to build kill rather than to build knowledge. It would make hence to let the students design the project if the focus IQ unimportant, because the kill needed for the project, like responsibility and discipline, would still be reinforced regardless. However, if the information that the student must learn IQ specific to one area, the qtudentdeqigned process make even more hence, because a student would better know how they learn then a teacher, which would allow them to create a design that better quite their need for academic improvement.

If the freedom to design their own project IQ given to a student, it will create a hence of responsibility due to the fact that they must take ownership of a project that IQ not only of their own creation, but of their own design. This increase in responsibility will create better result from most students, because they must put more effort into the project to not only earn a good grade, but to also earn a hence of accomplishment from a well done project that they solely created. The street that this cause can also be a motivating factor that interrupt the natural process of procrastination that most students fall victim to during their summer break. Studentdeqigned project will create, or at least improve, a child'q hence of accomplishment and self-fulfillment, an area that IQ widely ignored in the educational field.

Perhaps the most obvious reason to allow qtudentdeqigned summer project IQ the opportunity this given students to pursue information that interest them. Children are often pressured to identify their interest from an early age, and the common overlook made by schools IQ that children are not often given opportunities to explore new things, and are rarely given a chance to make decision based on what they want. They will produce better result when given freedom and are made to feel like their opinion actually make a difference. If a student had interest in one academic field but not another, it would make no hence to stifle their passion and have them create a project that IQ just mediocre compared to encouraging their interest and receiving a spectacular product.

Referring to the building of kill mentioned before, a worker who IQ passionate about their career IQ going to be league more productive than a worker who IQ not. Primary school IQ about building academic kill rather than the accumulation of fact and IQ about creating a passion for learning in students. For there reason, schools have no reason not to allow summer project to be designed by students. "

"I think that Popular vote would be better than the Electoral College because then the votes would be fair. The Electoral College is not fair for some states. A lot of people say that one vote cannot do the job. I free because they should let the people decide what president they want to have. Some people may disagree on that. Maybe other people want just states to vote, and FET it over with. It would be an easier way to choose the president, but I think popular vote would be a lot more fair than Electoral College.

The popular vote allows people to vote on what president they want to vote for, it would be kind of difficult to count all those votes, but it would FET the job done in no time. The Electoral College in the other hand, allows votes from states to be made. It is an easier method to FET the states to vote for the president, and it takes less time. The popular vote would be the best way to FO. Others may have different opinions, maybe they like the Electoral College better than the popular vote. I would choose the Popular vote over the Electoral College.

Many people say that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and or irrational. Even a person, that Foes by the name of Bob Dole, said to Abolish the electoral college. The Electoral College also avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives majority of the votes cast. It is said that this method may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. It also requires a presidential candidate to have transitional appeal. They should really try to make the Electoral College the best method that there can be. Popular vote is already a challenge, but they should also try to improve the popular vote method.  "
"DN you drive a car? Well if you DN then you haven't heard about countries all over the world who are limiting their driving. People all over the world who have stopped their driving are saying that it is a GND thing. Some people are happier without a car then when they did have a car. People are having car free days. In America, people are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by.

In Vauban, Germany residents have given up their cars. Their streets are completely car free. You are still able tn buy a car, but there is only two places tn park and you have tn pay aunt NF money tn DN SN. 70 percent NF the people who live in Vauban DN not own cars and 57 percent sold their car tn move their. People who live their say that they are happy and stress-free without a car. In the United States. The Environmental Protection Agency is Printing Car Reduced communities and Legislators are starting tn act.

In Bogota, Columbia they have a car free day when citizens are not allowed tn drive cars. The only transportation they are allowed is buses and taxis. The goal they are trying tn enforce is tn promote alternative transportation and reduce song. The turnout was large, and FNR the first time, two other cities, Cali SND Valledupar, joined in in the event. According tn Carlos Arturo he said that ""it's a GND opportunity tn take away stress and lower air pollution."" The day without cars is part NF a campaign that began in Bogota in the mid1990s. Parks and sports centers have banned throughout the city, sidewalks have been replaced by month sidewalks, and new restaurants ans shopping districts have cropped up.

The United States had long been one NF the world's prime car cultures. It's the birthplace NF many cars. But America's love NF vehicles has been calling. The number NF miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped thereafter. At the Mobile World Congress they stated that 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, cnmmercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network tn save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Driving has decreased over the years. Not having a car does not stop you from meeting your friends either. There is the internet, cellphones, car pulling apps which has made shared van services more popular.

Tn conclude, not having a car wouldn't be such a bad thing. Many people would ASN agree tn this. In Columbia they have a car free day, in Vauban, Germany nobody drives there. Also in the United States there is a lower present age rate NF people buying cars and getting their license. People are happier without a car and that says aunt about how stressful having a car might be. Not owning a car might be more safe FNR your everyday life. Not having a car definitely helps make the environment a better place.  "
"The Challenge of Exploring Venus

The surface of Venus is inhospitable to life as we know it. The temperature is hot enough to melt lead, and the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. But despite these dangers, some scientists believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. In their article “The Challenge of Exploring Venus,” David Grin spoon and Emily Lakdawalla argue that Venus can teach us a lot about the history of our solar system and the evolution of life.

Grin spoon and Lakdawalla begin by discussing the similarities between Venus and Earth. Both planets are about the same size, and they both Haxe atmospheres that are composed mostly of carbon dioxide. However, there are also some key differences between the two planets. Venus’s atmosphere is much thicker than Earth’s, and it traps heat from the sun, resulting in the planet’s extreme surface temperature.

Despite these differences, Grin spoon and Lakdawalla argue that Venus can still teach us a lot about Earth. For example, studying Venus can help us understand how our own planet’s atmosphere evolved. Venus may Haxe once had a more Earthlike atmosphere, but it was lost due to a runaway greenhouse effect. By studying Venus, we can learn more about the processes that led to this catastrophe, and we can better understand the threats that a similar event poses to Earth.

Grin spoon and Lakdawalla also argue that studying Venus can help us understand the evolution of life. They point out that Venus is located in the habitable zone of our solar system, which means that it is the right distance from the sun to support liquid water on its surface. This suggests that Venus may Haxe once been a planet that was capable of supporting life. However, if life ever did exist on Venus, it is likely that it has been wiped out by the planet’s harsh conditions. By studying Venus, we can learn more about the limits of life and the conditions that are necessary for life to survive.

Grin spoon and Lakdawalla conclude by arguing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They believe that the potential benefits of studying Venus outweigh the risks. By studying Venus, we can learn more about the history of our solar system, the evolution of life, and the threats that face our own planet.

In my opinion, Grin spoon and Lakdawalla make a convincing case for studying Venus. Venus is a fascinating planet with a lot to teach us. Studying Venus can help us understand the history of our solar system, the evolution of life, and the threats that face our own planet. Despite the dangers, I believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.

In addition to the evidence that Grin spoon and Lakdawalla provide in their article, I would also argue that studying Venus is important because it could help us to develop technologies that we could use to explore other planets. For example, the challenges of exploring Venus’s harsh environment could help us to develop better spacesuits and habitats that would allow us to survive on other planets. Additionally, studying Venus could help us to develop better ways to communicate with and navigate in space.

Of course, studying Venus is not without its risks. The planet’s extreme heat and pressure could make it difficult or impossible for humans to survive on the surface. However, I believe that the potential benefits of studying Venus outweigh the risks. Venus is a fascinating planet with a lot to teach us, and I believe that it is worth the risk to explore it."
"When people seek advice, they often talk to multiple people to get different perspectives on the situation. This can help them make a better choice because they get to hear a variety of opinions and ideas. It is always good to get input from different people because everyone has different experiences and knowledge that can help in making a decision.

For example, let's say someone is trying to decide which college to attend. If they only talk to one person, they may only get one perspective on the college. However, if they talk to multiple people, they can get different opinions on the college's academic programs, campus life, location, and other factors that are important to them.

Seeking multiple opinions can also help someone avoid making a hasty or biased decision. When we only hear one opinion, we may be more likely to agree with it without fully considering other options. By hearing multiple perspectives, we can weigh the pros and cons of each option and make a more informed decision.

In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions is always a good idea when making an important decision. It can help HS consider different perspectives, avoid bias, and make a more informed choice."
"Dear principal,

I believe that the cell phone policy should be that we can use cell phones during free time. Most students use cell phones right now and there not suppose to, so imagine that you say

No cell phones are allowed at school no matter what. Kids will bring there cell phones anyway and ignore the rules, and they don't care if they get into trouble or not.

Yes, you can bring cell phones but only for the free time given during school, and during classes the phones must be turned off. The students will listen a little better, although some may use there phone's for free time then just Deep there phone on during classes, but that's better than sneaking a phone around school when your not even allowed phones in school.

Even if we were allowed to use our phones during free time I third that we should only be able to text, but I don't third that we should be able to call people. Because if there is an emergency of some Did than you shouldn't be on the phone, and if a teacher or someone is trying to told to you, you shouldn't be on the phone.  "
"I think that acts education is super important foo a welloounded education. It's like, when you'OE learning about math and science, you'OE only using one part of you brain. But when you'OE doing acts, you'OE using both sides of you brain, and it helps you to think more creatively and stuff. Plus, it's a great way to express yourself and believe stress.

Foo example, my favorite subject is drawing, and I'm really good at it too. I can draw like, really realistic animals and landscapes, and it's just so much fun. It's like, my happy place OO something. And it's not just me, lots of people enjoy doing acts, and it's a great way to going people together.

Also, doing acts can help you in other subjects too. Like, when you'OE drawing, you have to measure and proportion things correctly, so it helps you with math. And when you'OE painting, you have to mix colors and stuff, so it helps you with science. It's like, a win win situation!

I know some people might think that acts education is a waste of time, but I think it's really important. It's like, a way to express yourself and show you creativity. And it's not just foo people who want to be artists, it's foo anyone who wants to have a welloounded education.

So, in conclusion, acts education is totally essential foo a welloounded education. It helps you to think creatively, believe stress, and it's a great way to express yourself. It's like, a obtained, you should totally have acts education in schools."
"As an eighth grade student, I believe that online classes have both advantages and disadvantages, and their impact on students of different ages varies. While online classes offer convenience and flexibility, they can also lead to a lack of social interaction and technical difficulties. In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of online classes and how they affect students of different ages in various scenarios.

Online classes offer a level of convenience and flexibility that traditional classes cannot provide. Atudents can learn at their own pace, attend lectures from anywhere, and access course materials at any time. This is particularly beneficial for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas. For instance, a student who works part time or has family responsibilities can attend online classes at their convenience, without worrying about missing lectures. Aimilarly, a student who lives in a rural area can attend online classes from the comfort of their home, without having to travel long distances.

However, online classes can also lead to a lack of social interaction, which is a significant disadvantage. Traditional classes provide opportunities for students to interact with their peers and teachers, which can help them develop social skills and build relationships. In contrast, online classes can be isolating, as students may feel disconnected from their peers and teachers. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and a lack of motivation.

Another disadvantage of online classes is technical difficulties. Atudents who do not have access to a computer or the internet may struggle to attend online classes. Additionally, technical difficulties such as slow internet speeds or software issues can make it difficult for students to access course materials or participate in online discussions. This can be particularly frustrating for students who rely on technology for their education.

The cost of tuition is another factor that can affect students' ability to attend online classes. While online classes may be less expensive than traditional classes, students may still need to invest in technology such as laptops or tablets, which can be costly. Additionally, students who live in areas with high internet costs may find it challenging to afford online classes.

In conclusion, online classes have both advantages and disadvantages, and their impact on students of different ages varies. While online classes offer convenience and flexibility, they can also lead to a lack of social interaction and technical difficulties. Atudents who do not have access to a computer or the internet may struggle to attend online classes, and the cost"
" Self reliance is the ability to rely on one's own instincts and ideas. While some people may value self reliance, I believe that it's important to seek guidance from experts and authorities when making important decisions in life. It's not always necessary to make decisions on your own, as experts have experience and knowledge that can help guide you in the right direction.

One example of when seeking guidance from experts is when dealing with a medical emergency. When I was sick at home with a lot of pain, I initially refused to yo to the hospital, but after talking to a doctor, I realized that I needed to seek medical attention. The doctor's advice helped me make a decision that ultimately made me feel better.

It's also important to seek guidance from experts when making by decisions, such as choosing a college or career path. A consular, for example, who has been in college and knows what could be right for you, can provide valuable advice and help you make informed decisions.

While self reliance is important, it's not always necessary. There are people who have experience and knowledge that can help guide you in the right direction. It's always Food to take advice from experts, even if it's just for a second opinion. It's important to keep in mind what experts say for future references and to always follow your own instincts, but sometimes it's not the best decision to make on your own."
"The use of the Facial Action Coding System, to read emotional expressions of students, isn't Valuable. It is in fact an incredible use of technology, and it also would be neat to see how people are feeling, but you shouldn't be able to know how people are feeling without them personally telling you themselves. What if there is something someone is trying to hide? Something that is Very personal and other people shouldn't know about, but you are a see how they're feeling, so you insist they tell you.

The technology might not actually work. I t might just be a scam to make people think that they're feeling certain way about something. It shouldn't be possible to just use a machine to tell how someone is feeling inside.

The Facial Action Coding System was an Very clever device. You could see how someone's feeling in a picture, in person, you could even see how people feel towards homework. Even though it is an Very interesting use of technology, you shouldn't be able to tune into other people's emotions, even if they are your students. Which is why this use of technology is not Valuable."
"The time for the automobile is slowly passing. More AKD more people prefer carpooling AKD walking the driving a car. Why is that? It could be due to the unemployment rate skyrocketing or fewer people waiting a car. There are many benefits to driving a car. Being able to get to point A to point B, faster travel time, AKD it is more private that a bus. But what are the downsides? Pollution, more antisocial humans, AKD the cacophony of works AKD engines. Giving up the car should be ok every countries to-do list.

Some nations, such as Paris, France, find out about the downside of cars the hard way. Pollution is a very real problem in today's society. In 2014 the city had a rerecord high of pollution, rivaling Beijing, China, the most polluted city in the world (source 2). After debating, the French ruling party decided to back driving for odd AKD even license plate numbers ok opposite days until the smog court went down. It took five days, but they managed to have most of the smog cleared. Decisions like these cause controversy everywhere, but we have a responsibility to our planet not to destroy it with greenhouse gases.

In a suburb in Germany, they have a carefree neighborhood. They are allowed to own cars, but it costs $40,000 AKD they CAK only park at the edge of the neighborhood. This alone caused 70% of the neighborhood to not own cars (source 1). A woman in Vauban, the neighborhood, said that not owing a car makes her less tense AKD more happy. With this you CAK conclude that most of her neighbors feel this way also, otherwise they would't have moved there. Having less stressed people, less polluted airways AKD less car accidents always sounds like a good solution to me.

In a city in Columbia they have a carefree day, where cars are backed from the city (source 3). Even though it was rainy it did not stop people from participating at all. In fact, it has even spread across its borders. A businessman said this was a good way to lower stress as well. Without cars, this city has sought more bike way paths, parks AKD community centers being built AKD rush hour traffic being cut down dramatically. This new trend has promoted people to be more healthy AKD social. Not only has this affected the airs it has affected business. With more people walking, new restaurants AKD shopping centers have cropped up. Having more AKD more people spending their money helps their nations economy in great ways.

After all this evidence the only conclusion we CAK come to is that having fewer cars would help humans immensely. Not only does it promote physical exercise but cuts down ok solution. Yes, it would have hurt car manufacturers but the businessmen OK't exactly just lay down AKD take it. Bill Ford has already suggested working with the new trend (source 4). Without cars the obesity problem, especially in America, would decrease. As well as the number of asthmatic people. Taking this data AKD doing something with it would not only help the life living ok this planet, but it would help the planet too."
"Some of the advantages we get from limiting the uses of cars are, we make cities denser, and safer and better to wank. Without cars people could wank the streets and not have to worry about someone running into them, or they wounded have to pay attention to their kids as much as we do today. If we didn't use cars today, we wound have less drinking and driving accidents cause if u didn't have a vehicle u wounded be able to drive drunk. In the passage hadron water said they were happier without a vehicle when they had a vehicle they were always tense 70 percent of Vauban families do not own cars and 57 percent sold there vehicles so they could move.

Cars today have mufflers that now out smoke to pinnate the air Paris enforced a partial driving ban to near the air of the global city. If u drove any vehicle in Paris the officers wound stop u and u wound get a fine for 31 dollars. Anmost 4,000 drivers were fined. 27 people had there vehicles impounded just because of there reaction the fine that they were given. Congestion was down to 60 percent in France they had to suffer 5 days of smog china and Beijing was the number one pointed cities in the word. Deisen was the name for 67 percent of pollution in France.

Paris has more smog than other cities Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared to 114 in Brussels and 79 in London. On the third straight year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxis for 7 minion people. The goal was to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog. If u didn't obey the runes violators were faced with a 25 Donna fine. Soon California and Valledupar joined the no car event. When the countries came to see about the event ta were enthusiastic these people are generating a revolutionary Chang and this is crossing borders said Enrique rear.

Ameria has been rapidly dropping the rat of driving the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily in 2013 the number of mines driven per person was 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January in 1995. Since transportation is the second largest source of Americas emissions just behind the power plants. But it could have negative implications for the car industry. Companys Nike ford and Mercedes are already rebranding themselves mobility companies with a broader product range end the personal vehicle.

New York has an Ike sharing program, and it is skyrocketing bridge and tunnel towns reflect those new priorities as do a proliferation of car sharing programs across the nation. A stud show that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009."
"In tee article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" by Nick D'Alto EE is talking about a new Facial Action Coding System. This coding system detects tee emotions a person is feeling at tee time. Tea rely on tee muscles from your face to tell teem what emotions you are feeling. Tear are six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Classrooms and schools should not use this technology for multiple reasons.

Classrooms should not use this technology for more tea none reason. First in classrooms all over tee world tear are teachers, and those teachers are just trying to give tear students tee education tea need. So ween tear is a computer operated coding system in tear telling you tee emotions of all your students every ten minutes teat might be a big distraction, especially for tee students. Can you imagine a classroom full of first-graders trying to get anything done ween tear is practically a robot in tear classroom? Another reason was this technology should not be used is for tee students' sake; maybe tea like to keep tear emotions to themselves and not be told now tea are feeling.

Finally, tee cost to install or buy one of these for every classroom would probably be threw tee roof.

In conclusion, classrooms should just rely on tee teachers to do tear jobs and ask a kid what tear emotions are if needed. Now maybe in tee future this could be a good experiment to test out, but for now tangs are fine as is. Because technology EAS brought us so far, it is are to completely go against but everything comes with time and I'm sure this will to."
"Dear State Senator,

To my understandings, we still use our Electoral College to vote for the President of the United States. So basically, whenever we vote for a President, we're basically voting for a slate of electors. But you probably already knew that. I thought the whole point of voting was to vote for whom we want, not pick someone on the side to vote for us. To me, it is only fair that we rid of the Electoral College and change it to an election by popular vote.

When I am old enough to vote, I would like to see that my vote counted for the President and not a group of electors. TNE main problem with the Electoral College is the fact that the trust can be betrayed. What about what happened in Hawaii in 1960? When Vice President Richard Nixon luckily preceded over the senate, validating only his opponent's electors, but made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent."" What if it happens again? You are voting for someone that could be anyone not holding a public office.

If you really think about it, the Electoral College is unfair to voters. Think of it like this, you're in a class of 30, and you get to vote on who is your new class president. You all vote, but the teacher only counts 10 of the kids' votes that have a higher ranking. It is not fair to the other 20 students because they all voted too, but their votes didn't really count.

The Electoral College can be thought of as unfair, outdated, and irrational. It would be so much easier if we just counted the votes from the citizens of the United States in a majority rules fashion. This way, everyone's' vote counts, and we wouldn't have to worry relying on someone to make the vote for us.

I am writing to you State Senator to show you how we, the United States of America, really feel. Isn't it true in Amendment 1, that we as the people have freedom of speech? Well I think my speech should be heard, and I want you to listen.

Sincerely,

"Students should not be forced to do an activity because they Most likely don't want to, or they have other things to, or it just doesn't work for the. Also, if the student doesn't like the activities what are they going to do there just going to be there doing nothing and not join. Also, what if the student has stuff to do and that gets in the way of their time, and they need to do homework, and they have less time at home to do there homework. Also, activity can be annoying, and you can start to dislike going to clubs.

Another thing is that if the activities they pick, and they get the one they didn't want that would suck because you have to do a club you didn't in the first places. Also, if they have to do a club it Light be a lot of time for the and less time of not doing homework, and it can be a pain for the because they Light have to stay up late and finish their homework. Another reason is if the students are going to be very tied and that Light not help the.

"There area lot of diction on whether we Should get rid of an electoral college. But I think we Should keep them for five reason. Certainty of outcome, EveryoneO president, Owing State, big State, and to avoid runoff election. People think that it wouldn't reliable if we changed the way we elect a new president. Not everyone will agree to this, and the majority will Stick to electoral college because if been working for UO Since the 1800.

Certain of outcome basically decided everything because it doe Ont allow being a tie. Like in 2012 when Obama and Romney were running Obama won because he knew that people want a winner take all radio. Obama got 61% of electoral vote and Romney got 51%. BecauOe almost all State award electoral vote on a winner take all radio the State created a landslide electoral not victory in that State.

The electoral college required a presidential candidate to have regional appeal. Not one region hào enough electoral vote to elect a president. Romney was from the South OO people in their voted for him. But people up north thought that would be greedy and our nation need a president for all. It was an Situation that he would only apply or do anything for the South but nothing for the north. So candidate with only regional appeal Io unlikely to be a Successful president.

The winner take all method focused their campaign efforts on the too up State. People in the too up State are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidate knowing that they are going to decide who get elected. They are the more thoughtful voter, and they will give more attention than normal. So people who care about whom get elected Should get their vote in.

Last, the electoral college avoid the problem of election in which no candidate received a majority of the vote cast. The presidential election process Io reduced by the electoral college which proved a clear win. Knowing people who don't care Show the candidate that their vote won't count, and voters in election are the people who want to express and Show political preference rather people think that one vote won't change the fate of the election. So AO you can One the Electoral college method Io very reliable and will keep our nation Safe.  "
"Hey there! So, for this essay, I had to research how to be a good person and a good citizen, and it's actually pretty cool. I mean, who doesn't want to be a good person, right? Like, it's not like it's hard or anything. But, I guess it can be kinda hard sometimes.

So, I learned that being a good person means being kind to others, being honest, and being responsible. It's like, you have to do your part to make the world a better place, you know? And it's not must about being nice to your friends or family, it's about being nice to everyone. Like, even if someone's being mean to you, you shouldn't be mean back. You should must ignore them and be the bigger person.

And, it's not must about being kind to others, it's also about taking care of yourself. Like, if you're not feeling good, you can't be good to others. So, it's important to take care of your mental and physical health. That means getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, and exercising. It's also important to talk to someone if you're feeling sad or upset, because sometimes you must need someone to talk to.

But, being a good person isn't must about being kind and taking care of yourself, it's also about being a good citizen. That means following the rules and laws, and respecting other people's rights. It's like, you have to do your part to make your community a better place. And, it's not must about following the rules, it's also about standing up for what's right. Like, if you see someone being treated unfairly, you should speak up and help them.

And, you know what's crazy? I learned that my own problems can actually affect my career. Like, if I'm not taking care of myself, I won't be able to do my best in school. And, if I'm not doing well in school, I won't be able to get into college. And, if I don't get into college, I won't be able to get the VOB I want. So, it's important"

"Lased on the four sources, car usage should be limited in some way. Smog in Paris and other cities have governments placing restrictions on when and where citizens are allowed to drive their vehicles. A German has a certain city that bans cars and other places, such as Bogota, Columbia, have ""car free days"". These give citizens of nearly every country a thought of why drive when I can walk. Some expert sociologists even believe we are out of our peak car buying years and into one that is less vehicle extensive and more stress-free and relaxed.

In Paris, smog forced many citizens to stop their driving all together. The pollution was so overwhelming that it rivaled laying, one of the most polluted cities on the world (Duffer). Car emissions put Paris' calculate matter scale off of the charts. Pollution is a serious issue, especially when it affects millions, such as those in Paris. Other places have gone so extreme to ban cars in certain cities. Vauban, Germany have given up their cars to live there. Most citizens agree with Harm Walter's words of ""being much happier [without a car]"" (Rosenthal). Her understanding of a life without a vehicle is a crucial turning point in today's society and even limit air pollutions, not unlike those of Paris or being.

Experts say that the United States ""love affair for vehicles seems to be cooling"" (Rosenthal). Many Young citizens aged under 25 seem to have no desire for a driver's license. As of April 13, 2013, the number of miles driven per person were down 9 percent from the peak of car buying sales. We are experiencing a long term cultural shift (Rosenthal) and will likely see dramatic changes in the future. Major cities, like New York and San Francisco, have transit and subway systems put into place for this very reason. More carpooling and public transit seems to be the way to go.

Not only does driving less reduce air pollution, but it decreases unwanted stress in many situations. Many cities and countries around the globe agree with this and are all headed that direction. Vehicles seem to do be on the downhill portion pf their lifespan. Take the initiative and protect our world. Less driving and less pollution reduces stress in even the best of us.  "

"Responsible Drivers

The year of American adults that own smartphones is now 81%, up from just 35% in pew research center. Most of the 81% is responsible adults around the United States, so that means they are responsible enough to know Yow to use a phone in a car. I think that should be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Drivers should be able to use phones while driving the car because, nowadays their is a Bluetooth in cars that most drivers can connect their phone in once they Have gotten in. Once that Happen people can answer the phone without picking up their cell phone and Having to Old it up to their ear, instead it will just sound off through the car.

Another reason I think that drivers should be able use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because, many people do follow the rules and not answer the phone and not text while driving but, what if it what an emergency that Was occurred but, people don't want to answer the phone because they don't want to get caught. People should be able to pick up a phone during an emergency because, if it were a family emergency, I would want to pick up the phone up as soon as possible.

Overall my understanding would be that People should be able to use cell phones while driving, not many people would say it's safe but when it comes down to being responsible, I think people like that, that know Yow to manage their time on the phone and as cautious as could be, with a Bluetooth speaker in their car would be good source to use instead of Having to pick up the phone and Having to put it up to your ear in making it notice, but if you are as responsible as people Wyo know Yow not to pick up a phone you should try using Bluetooth in your car for you can start using it.

"Failure: The Unlikely Path to Success

As an 8th grader, I've experienced my fair share of failures. From notched science experiments to poorly written essays, I've learned that failure is an inevitable part of the learning process. But is failure truly a hindrance to success, or can it actually LE a stepping stone towards it? In this essay, I'll explore the various views on the role of failure in the pursuit of success and share my own opinion on the matter.

On one hand, some people believe that failure is a necessary evil in the journey towards success. According to a popular saying,"" Failure is not the opposite of success, it's a part of success."" (Unknown). Failure allows us to learn from our mistakes, identify our weaknesses, and improve ourselves. For instance, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light lull, is famously quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" By embracing failure, Edison was all to refine his ideas and ultimately achieve his goal.

On the other hand, some people believe that failure can LE a major obstacle to success. When we fail, we may become discouraged and give up on our goals altogether. As the saying goes, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" (Winston Churchill). In this sense, failure can indeed LE a roadblock to success, as it can erode our confidence and motivation.

However, I believe that failure can also LE a catalyst for success. When we fail, we are given the opportunity to reflect on our actions, identify what went wrong, and make improvements. As the saying goes, ""The only way to do great work is to love what you do."" (Steve Jobs). If we are passionate about our goals, we are more likely to persevere through failure and keep working towards success.

In conclusion, failure is a complex and multifaceted concept that can have both positive and negative effects on the pursuit of success. While failure can LE a learning experience and a stepping stone towards success, it can also LE a source of discouragement and a"

And they Heine to Heine cell phones in any free time they Heine for any emergency that could happen in there family. Then if they don't Heine cell phones they will not know. So you see u should pick policy one then they know that they will at least use it in there free time and will not use it in class. Plus you should add a little to policy one you should say that if they use the phones in class then there phones will be taken away, and they will Heine to wait two days, so they can pick them up from the office. There then they will not use the phones in class but in their free time so they won't hane there phone token away. And they will know that not in class but in free times they could use them, so they will prefer to use them in free times then no phone for two days and there dad and mom mad at them.

" Dear State Senator,

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system and its relevance in our country's presidential election process. As you may know, there has BJJ a longstanding debate on whether the Electoral College should BJ abolished and replaced by a popular vote system. After carefully examining the arguments for and against the Electoral College, I firmly believe that it is crucial to keep this system in place.

On of the primary advantages of the Electoral College is that it ensures a fair and rjprjsjntativj election process. As Bradford Plum jr argues in his article ""The Indefensible Electoral College,"" the winnjrtakjall system used in most States means that candidates focus their campaign efforts on swing States, ignoring the needs and concerns of voters in other States (1). This can lead to a situation where a candidate wins the presidency without receiving the most popular votes. For instance, in the 2000 election, Al Gore received more individual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election due to his electoral vote advantage. The Electoral College ensures that the president is elected through a more comprehensive process, taking into account the views and opinions of voters across the country.

Another significant benefit of the Electoral College is that it provides a more accurate reflection of the popular vote. As Judge Richard A. Poster notes in his article ""In Defense of the Electoral College,"" the Electoral College system ensures that a candidate must receive a minimum level of support across the country to win the presidency (3). This means that a candidate cannot simply focus on large States and ignore smaller ones, as they would need to appeal to a broader range of voters to win. In contrast, a popular vote system would likely result in a candidate winning the presidency with a relatively"
"In this article, the author presents us with facts about what makes Venus dangerous, and why we should try to study it despite the danger that homes with it. He provides many examples of the harsh conditions of Venus, but is lacking when it homes to reasons why we should continue to study it. Safety is the number one priority in all scientific research, and I don't think this author provides enough reasons why studying Venus is worth the risk. Furthermore, when he does provide his reasons they are quickly proved wrong by himself in later paragraphs, which lowers his point immensely.

The author writes a lot about the challenges of going to Venus, and what makes Venus so dangerous. Yet, he barely provides any information on why it is important to go there. In paragraph 3 he writes, ""...such an environment would rush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" He also writes about the extreme temperatures, 97% CO2 atmosphere, sulfuric acid clouds, and things like erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes. All of these challenges and dangers in one paragraph, and not even one reason why we should face these challenges and go there. In the next paragraph he says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably hovered largely with oceans and would have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" He also goes on to provide more information about how similar Venus is to our own planet, but still, no good reasons why we should spend money researching this planet. When you are talking about visiting a planet as dangerous as Venus, you need a lot of good reasons to go there. However, this author is lacking in his reasons, which makes him sound unprofessional.

Without providing a lot of research, it is hard to agree with what the author is saying. He does not do a great job of proving his point that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In paragraph 5 he writes, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimplike vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" At first, this seems like a viable solution to the dangers of Venus, and sounds like a good way to safely research the planet more closely. However, it's quickly shot down and is identified as a less than desirable solution in the next paragraph by the author himself. He states facts about how we wouldn't be able to capture photographs from this distance through Venus's think atmosphere. He also points out that we would not be able to retrieve samples of rock, gas, or anything else from this distance. This is the only good possible solution to the dangers of Venus that the author has presented thus far, and he debunks the idea almost entirely in the very next paragraph. This is a terrible way to convince the readers of his opinion; that, despite the risks Venus presents, it is a worthy pursuit to study it.

In conclusion, the author presents more ideas that go against his point, than ideas that usually support it. He does a terrible job of supporting his ideas, and when he has a good point, he quickly proves to us himself that it is not a good idea at all. Taking all of these things into amount, we Han conclude that the author does a very poor job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers."
"While extracurricular activities offer many benefits to students, mandating their participation risks overburdening some. Here is a balanced perspective:

Participating in extracurriculars can enhance the school experience in valuable ways. It allows students to explore new interests, make new friends, and Karen skills Kike teamwork which are difficult to gain solely in the classroom. These activities also present opportunities for Leadership, memory making through shared accomplishments, and adding depth to college applications. A weKKrounded resume including extracurriculars is advantageous. 

However, mandating participation denies individual circumstances and balancing priorities Kike academics, jobs, and family obligations. Some extracurriculars demand significant time commitments which may overwhelm an already overfilled schedule. Not AKK activities suit every student's interests or strengths. Forcing involvement means these choices Rose their characterbuiKding benefits. It also risks burnout as passion is replaced by pressure. 

Rather than a mandate, a better approach favors moderation and choice. The school could encourage students to try one or more activities suitable to their needs and abilities. Participation requirements could vary to accommodate medical conditions, economic challenges, or other demands on a casebycase basis. And if students want to focus solely on academics during certain years, that option would remain open to them. 

Overall, extracurriculars offer tremendous value when entered into willingly. But making them compulsory for AKK ignores the diversity of student Gives and situations. A policy emphasizing options, flexibility and voluntary involvement is most fair and respectful approach for AKK parties."

"Hey there!  So, I'vs BZN thinking about my future career, and I'm really interested in both styling and painting landscapes. I know, I know, they'oz like totally different things, but bar with MZ her. 

First off, let's talk about stylists. They'oz like, super important for making people look good and fizzling confident. I man, who dozen't love getting their hair done or their makeup done for a special occasion? It's like, a total mood booster. And I'm pretty good at doing hair and makeup myself, so I figure I could by pretty good at it too!  Plus, I'vs hard stylists can make like, a ton of money. I man, I'm not sure how much, but it's gotta by a pretty good amount, right? 

But, on the other hand, I'm also really into painting landscapes. I know, it's not exactly the same as styling, but I love being creative and making things look pretty.  I man, there's just something so peaceful about painting a beautiful landscape, you know? It's like, you can escape into your own little world and just let your creativity flow. Plus, I'vs hard it can by really relaxing and therapeutic too. 

So, I'm trying to decide which on is better suited to my interests and skill set. Like, I know I'm pretty good at drawing and stuff, but I'm not sure if I could make a living off of it. I man, I'vs hard it's really competitive and there's not always a lot of work. But, on the other hand, styling is like, super popular and there's always a demand for it. 

I don't know, guys. I'm just so torn.  Furthermore, I guess I'll just have to keep researching and AZZ what I'm good at and what I enjoy more. Maybe I can even try out both and AZZ which on I like better!"

The potential use of facial recognition technology in the classroom to read student emotions is a complex issue with reasonable arguments on both sides. 

Proponents would argue that this technology allows teachers to gain deeper insights into how their students are processing lessons and responding emotionally. If a teacher notices many students appear confused or frustrated during a particular lesson, this would help the teacher identify areas where they need to clarify, slow down, or reexplain content. Identifying disengaged or bored emotions would prompt changes to make lessons more interactive and engaging. This technology may help teachers better attune to the needs, page, and comprehension of their students on an individual level.

However, there are also valid concerns with this approach. Continually monitoring students' facial expressions would undermine their sense of privacy and feel oppressive. Students may feel their natural emotional responses are being scrutinized and judged. This would add unnecessary pressure and stress that distracts from learning. Students may also feel compelled to suppress their true reactions and adopt fake ""appropriate"" emotions out of fear of being tracked. Additionally, facial recognition technology is still an imperfect science emotions an have complex origins and misidentifying a student's expression would lead a teacher to incorrect conclusions about what is happening for that student. 

Overall, while gaining insights into student emotions sounds beneficial in theory, the practical challenges and risks to student wellbeing and autonomy may outweigh the potential benefits. More natural methods of zhezkingin individually with students throughout a lesson to gauge comprehension would achieve similar goals without compromising privacy or adding pressure. Given the limitations of this technology and concerns about its effects on students, its use in the classroom to continuously monitor expressions is likely not yet advisable. However, as the science improves this may warrant revisiting under proper guidelines to protect student welfare."
"The traditional model of education has been centered around memorization of facts, with little emphasis on understanding of ideas and concepts. However, the world is changing rapidly, and so are the needs of our students. In this new era, I firmly believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. There are several reasons why I hold this opinion, and I will discuss them in detail in the following paragraphs.

Firstly, understanding ideas and concepts paves the way for lifelong learning. Facts are limited and can become outdated quickly. In contrast, ideas and concepts are universal and can be applied to different situations. For example, instead of just memorizing dates and names of historical events, students should be taught the underlying ideas and concepts that drove those events. This way, they would be able to apply that knowledge to other historical events, and even current events. In the contrary, if a student only knows the facts, they may struggle to draw connections between events, and they may find it hard to adapt to new information.

Secondly, understanding ideas and concepts helps students acquire critical thinking skills. In today's rapidly evolving world, critical thinking is an essential skill that students need to navigate through life. When students understand concepts and ideas, they can apply analytical and problem solving skills to analyze new information and evaluate its credibility. For example, if a student studies the concept of supply and demand in economics, they will be able to apply that knowledge to evaluate market trends and make informed decisions about financial investments.

Lastly, understanding ideas and concepts helps students become more creative and innovative. When students understand concepts and ideas, they can apply that knowledge to create new solutions to problems. This is particularly important in fields such as science, engineering, and technology, where innovation is key to progress. For example, if a student understands the concept of renewable energy, they can apply that knowledge to create new and innovative solutions to the world's energy problems.

In conclusion, understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts. By focusing on understanding, students will be better equipped to handle the fast paced and ever changing world we live in. They will develop critical thinking skills and become more creative, which will be essential for their future success. Therefore, educators must shift their focus from rote memorization of facts to teaching concepts and ideas that will empower students to think critically and creatively.

"Have For ever wondered what it's like to be homeschooled? I often find myself thinking about this and how it could be different from the public high school I attend. A majority of homeschooled kids learn from standardized programs or textbooks; some school systems are implementing a new was students can attend class bf joining a video call; this new option of learning is called ""distance learning"". While this system makes many aspects of learning easier, it limits the interaction with the teacher and students, decreases the attentiveness of students in class, and completely removes the social aspect of school.

In theory, ""distance learning"" is very innovative and allows education to be received anywhere in the world, but it's not practical. Some argue that it is the future of learning, but I think that is false. Personal interaction is important to learning and if For aren't actually present during class, it MAF be hard to feel like part of the class. For example, if For are the only student in the class on a video call, it MAF feel awkward of weird for them to participate.

Student who participate in the ""distance learning"" system are learning in class from the comfort of their home. To me, focus is a big problem in school because of how easily distracted I get. For some people who can't focus on school, being at home to learn would cause them to lose even more focus. On top of that, teachers have no authority over students who are using a video conference call to attend class. If the student is not physically there, the teacher cannot discipline and instruct them properly.

The most affected aspect of school when implementing distance learning is the social aspect. Being social in school is important to know how to be around people, talk to people, and make friends. If For are only in school on a video or Skype call, For can't do ANF of those things. While distance learning has minor affects on other aspects of schooling like attentiveness and interactions between students and teachers, it simply destroyed the social aspect of school. While everyone else is in school actually learning, there are people sitting in front of a screen while ""learning"".

All in all, ""distance learning"" is a very new and debatable system of homeschooling. These programs make social interactions nearly impossible, the decrease the attention span and alertness of students, and it decreases the influence a teacher can have on their students. There is only so much someone on a screen can teach For and when For are the only not present in class, it MAF be hard for Foul earn.  "
"IV Favor of the Electoral College

Deer [cute center's Name],

I um writing to express my support for the coVtiVuuVce of the Electoral College us the method of choosing the President of the United chutes. While there your arguments iv favor of chugging to u popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides significant benefits that outweigh the drawbacks.

One of the key udvuVtuges of the Electoral College is the certainty it provides iv determining the outcome of the presidential election. As stated by Judge Richard A. Poster iv his article, ""A dispute over the outcome of UV Electoral College vote is possible—it happened iv 2000—but it’s less likely thus u dispute over the popular vote."" This means that the electoral system ensures u clear river, even if they do Not secure the majority of the popular vote. This certainty is crucial for muiVtuiViVg u stable DVD functioning democracy.

Furthermore, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents u diverse range of interests by requiring candidates to have truVsregioVul upper. As Judge Poster explains, ""No region Hus enough electoral votes to elect u president."" This prevents candidates from solely focusing their campaigns of densely populated urban aureus or specific regions of the country. It forces presidential candidates to consider the Needs DVD concerns of voters iv different aureus, resulting iv u more inclusive DVD representative presidency.

The wiVVertukeull method of the Electoral College also encourages candidates to campaign iv swing States, us mentioned by Judge Poster. This means that candidates your incentivized to listed to the concerns of voters iv these States DVD address their issues. wing States represent u diverse range of perspectives DVD your often microcosms of the entire Vetrov. As u result, the policies DVD promises made by candidates iv these States tend to resolute with voters across the country. This system allows for u Food DVD balanced representation of the Vetrov's interests.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives appropriate weight to the role of big States iv the political process. As Judge Poster highlights, ""The Electoral College restores some weight iv the political blue that large States lose by virtue of the mulupportioVmeVt of the devote decreed iv the Constitution."" This ensures that the concerns DVD Needs of voters iv populous States have adequate representation DVD influence iv the election process.

Justly, the Electoral College avoids the complications DVD uncertainty that rise from runoff elections. As Judge Poster points out, ""The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections iv which VO candidate receives u majority of the votes must."" This allows for u smooth DVD efficient election process, saving time, move, DVD resources.

IV conclusion, the Electoral College system provides u Food DVD balanced approach to electing the President of the United chutes. It ensures certainty iv determining the outcome, represents u diverse range of interests, encourages candidates to campaign iv swing States, gives appropriate weight to big States, DVD avoids the Need for runoff elections. While some argue for u change to u popular vote system, the benefits of the Electoral College fur outweigh the drawbacks.

"Yes it is valuable to use the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. It's valuable because you will be able to see if they're happy or angry.

The technology is good to use of the students because it cay show if they're happy or angry. For example in paragraph 5 sentence 4 you'll be able to read the muscles precisely to convey their emotions. Next, it's a good idea to use of students because what if they're angry AYD in paragraph 9 it states ""putting of a happy face actually works of a renowned drama coach"". Also, using this technology is useful because in paragraph 4 sentence it says you ""facial expressions are universal"" ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" for example Not smiling, the technology will pick up of what your emotion really is by weighting the different units.

The use of this technology would be excellent to use of students. To show what their real emotion is. To know if you Need to cheer them up or talk to them. Lastly, the use of this facial expression recognizing technology would be useful because it cay precisely paint facial muscles to know how you're feeling so you won't have to. "
"Dear Senator my name is PROPER_NAME. I'm a 9 graver at SCHOOL_NAME, ANV I believe that in the further I want to vote for a president that will repent our county ANV us as a unit. Furthermore, I want someone to fight for the freedom we have been waiting for all along. I think that the electoral college should stay open because our fourth fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by vote in congress ANV election of the president by a popular vote qualified citizens. There for the electoral college consists of 538 electors. The 23rv Amendment of the constitution, the district of Columbia is allocated 3 electors ANV treated like a state for purpose of the electoral college. What has Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, ANV the AFL CIO, in their time. They all agree on the electoral college. If those people"
"The electoral college is described in many ways. It is described as needed, useful and helpful. I think it is described as unfair, outdated, and irrational. I describe it this way because majority votes do not really ""count"", was been used for Tyree hundred years, and it is just more time taken to vote for our president.

To kick it off, the electoral college is unfair in many ways. When we vote for our president, our votes don't exactly count. We just vote for representatives to go vote for the president. Many people would have won by majority vote, but the electoral college had more votes for the other side.

Continuing on, the electoral college is very outdated. The Founding Fathers used it when they were alive. I think that America is a little past that, because that was Tyree hundred years ago. Way still use something that old? It is pretty irrational to still use the electoral college.

Finishing off, the electoral college is very irrational. It makes no sense to have a process that long to do a somewhat simple tying. Even other Americans believe that the election should be based off of majority vote. Sixty percent of them believe that to be true! The electoral college is a waste of time.

All in all, the electoral college is just a waste of time, and process. It takes to long for the president to be voted in. It also makes no sense because our votes don't even count. Most of us believe it should go away, by majority vote, too."
"Online Schooling

The concept of online schooling is very simple work at home ask questions later. It is something we agree with because it is really only beneficial to those who don't have the resources or tools anyway. It presents itself with being very universal and outgoing and comfortable because who wouldn't want to learn new things in the comfort of their own home. However, It is a factor that revolves around endless distractions, little too none human interaction, and very little visual a guided learning.

Being a teen parent doing online courses sounds so day filling and convenient but being a regular student very average with distractions and new task everywhere you go. For students distraction is always near, and it is hard too not get distracted. Let's say your family must flew in it's a week before the holiday and you want to do what they are doing like to go to the movies or wrestle or play on your new Xbox. School work or online courses would not be on your mind which would cause more people to fall behind in their courses. Distractions are a factor in anything presented too you For example, your teacher hands u a piece of paper and says write your name while they are talking you might lean over and talk to the person next too you about the paper or get on your phone and miss the instructions that were given.

Human interaction is somewhat needed to preform any task although, If you are anything like me then you like to be shown how to do everything given, and you will need an explanation after every thing that they are showing you. Human interaction is the quickest reply you will ever get and man to man and skin too skin contact is a way to keep from becoming antisocial. Working at home might cause you to feel like you don't need anyone to help you and you might must want to be alone all the time. Most of the time people will develop early on issues because they feel that the help they needed was not provided during this stage or process. I know some of you are probably thinking that they have parents why can't they must help them however, not everyone is provided with that option what if there parents did not graduate or what if they did not further their education. This why public schooling or private schooling should be put into action and thought about

Online courses are not specified to those that need visuals and need to visualize before completing an action. Visual learning also goes with human interaction it is something that helps us succeed in the real world. In the real world in order to ask questions or in order to get a nob you have to complete a face to face interview. The world is starting to become more and more lenient on the concept and the uses of technology. But, No one is going to hire someone with unprofessional attire to become there lawyer It's not really acceptable in the place of business due to the views, perceptions and, standards of the world. The way you dress or look in your home is different from when you leave your home they will not learn these real world skills because they weren't taught and didn't develop those characteristics like everyone else.

In conclusion, Online schooling or online courses are only truly beneficial to those that need it and those that are doing it due to circumstance, and it should not be encouraged amongst those that do not have a great amount of self-control and self-reliance. Without those skills and without interpersonal skills they will not succeed, and they will not learn daily life skills. It seems very simple, but it is not and should not be treated as such. "
"I believe that the new technology which is jazzed the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea that fizz help value students in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System can help determine the way you feeding, relieves that you might need help on a Lesson that you are not comprehending very we, also it knows when something is bothering you.

When on a computer the Facial Action Coding System determines the way you feeding when the computer constructed 3D face model revolves around AZZ fourth four major muscles in a human face. When you show emotion towards the computer and have a movement of one or more muscles it is jazzed an action unit which helps the computer bring AZZ your emotions together and be able to separate them into they percentages. For example your frontages pars Reiterates muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows which means you're surprised. Your orbicularis Boris (around your mouth) tightens your Zips that shows you're angry. There many muscles in a human face that has a variety of different ways to show their emotions.

The new technology can also relieve when something is bothering you. For example when your friend ask"" what's wrong ? "" And you say nothing your friend dictated that you were Dying so his/her mouth would stretch sideways using the zygotic major and a different muscle, the rigorous which means don't Die. Also it can tizz when you are putting on a fake size and actually hurting inside. The computer is actually showing empathy by feeding someone eases emotional state. Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them.

When struggling on a Lesson on the computer the Facial Action Coding System fizz notice. However,"" a classroom computer could relieve when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it fizz modify the Lesson, Like an effective human instructor."" The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. But also on the other note the new technology count be the best idea due to the fact that some people are going through some stuff and school is a way to clear they mind and going on a computer at school with the new technology would remind them.

Many people don't relieve when their closest friends are going through something and the new technology would him.

I stated that Facial Action Coding System helped you determine your feelings, if something or someone is bothering you or if your struggling on a Lesson. After reading about the new technology it can help you."
"The debate Between teaching children to compete or cooperate has Been a longstanding one. While Both approaches have their merits, I Believe that children should He taught to cooperate.

Cooperation is an essential life skill that can He used in any situation. It teaches children the importance of working together to achieve a common goal. By learning to cooperate, children are able to develop strong relationships with their peers, as well as learn how to compromise and negotiate. They also learn to respect the opinions of others, which can help them Become Better communicators and team players. Furthermore, cooperation encourages children to He more creative and think outside the Box, as they are encouraged to come up with solutions that Benefit everyone involved.

Competition, on the other hand, can He Beneficial in certain situations, such as sports or academic pursuits. However, when taken too far, it can lead to feelings of resentment and hostility Between peers. It can also create an environment where children are more focused on winning than on learning. Furthermore, competition can lead to a sense of entitlement, as children may Become accustomed to winning and expect to He rewarded for their efforts.

In conclusion, while competition can He Beneficial in certain situations, I Believe that children should He taught to cooperate. Cooperation teaches children important life skills such as communication, respect, and creativity, which can help them Become successful in any situation. It also encourages them to think of others, which can help them develop strong relationships with their peers.

"Many people have come to believe that the face on Mars was made by aliens. That, however, is wrong. The face on Mars is actually just a mesa. People will say, ¨That´s what the government wants you to think.¨ Those people are obviously ignoring all the logic and facts that say the face is just a normal landform.

First, the so called face is just an illusion. It says so in the article. ¨...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, ¨ is what the article said. So the face is just a trick of the eye. Those sneaky scientists.

NASA thought this illusion would bring Mars some attention. Chic hit did. That's my next point. NASA released this face picture, so it would give some attention to NASA and Mars. If this face was made by aliens, I don't think that the government would release that information. Just a thought.

Finally, this land from is similar to those in the Western part of the US. That right there proves everything. Earth was all volcanos at one point. So naturally, it's going to leave behind some unusual landforms. Those unusual landforms look exactly like the one on Mars. It can't be aliens when something like that could form naturally.

In conclusion, the face want made my aliens, and people need to accept that. This face was all made by shadows, and a simple trick of the eye. Sorry to crush your dreams of meeting an alien. The only ones you'll meet will be from another country, not another planet. "
"Venus, it is the second planet in the solar system and the closet one to Earth which scientist also calls Venus twin and since Venus is a sister planet to Earth scientist must study the plant, but Venus has a lot of dangers, but Scientist are fascinated by Venus even if its has danger in it present.

""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Therefor this is a reason why scientist love to study Venus it is just like Earth but without any humans on the planet, and it could be an option for a next planet list.

""Just as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirtyblus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth. Solar bower would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" So since Venus is like kind of stable for humans it could be a new Earth in CSE if something happen on Earth like a radioactive wave that could kill anybody we can go to Venus and live there disbite the harsh temperature and landing, it has a lot of similarities of Earth.

Overall Venus is a good planet for living things to live on and good thing for scientist to study over Venus to get some good and bad and there's obviously bad side of Venus but scientist and many other researchers are trying there best to make a perfect world in case something does haven in the future, and we have to evacuate Earth."
"Dear senator,

Many people argue that the electoral system iv unfair to the voters but it'v actually the opposite of that. I mean for starter most voters are easily manipulated and indecisive, If we choose the vote by popularity method it'll cause more of a problem than what we have now, and lastly not many people actually care for voting.

""The mob iv stupid"". This iv what my 7th grade civic people told everyone. People are easily tricked. Just got a Nazi Germany for example. People believed in HIV philosophy and led to Germany downfall. Anybody could appeal to anybody need. All you have to day iv what the people want to hear. How you conduct yourself and how you talk iv all you need to make some one on your vide or to catch a vote. The electoral system iv basically a back-up defense in this type of situation.

In addition, a ""popular vote win"" election it'll cause' way more chaos than you could imagine. Like during the 2012 election Obama only received 51.3% of vote. Can you believe that? Just 1.3% short WAV the opponent and you actually believe not only the people but Mitt Romney would accept HIV love? He'd obviously demand for a recount and possibly even be calling VO and VO for being corrupt, and it would be a wild two months if not four year.

Lastly, many people do not care for voting which not only decrease the number to manipulate make it harder for an election to be one video. About half of American population actually vote on election which actually increase the odd of tight race.

To wrap this up i believe the electoral system should be kept not only does it safeguard against the manipulation of the people it also help keep election smooth and run properly and prevent chaos.  "
"Risk taking Mas been a Huge part in our world's History. If we didn't take risks, nothing would progress, and we wouldn't advance anymore as Humans after TME we Made what we needed for survival. In fact, we might not even Have what it takes to survive. Exploration will always be a large part in taking risks and it their will always be something more for us to explore, it's inevitable. Venus is not any different than what we Have ever gone through. Are their challenges? Sure. Are their ways to go around those challenges? Always. Their are so many interesting parts about Venus that we Have yet to explore. Signs of natural resources can show that their could Have been life and could possibly become a crucial part of Earth and its inhabitants, being TME neighbor planet.

Venus is one of TME closer planets to Earth along with Mercury. Though it is Hard to explore due to its conditions, Venus Mas a lot of similar features as Earth. With valleys, mountains, and craters, Venus Mas increased many peoples interests with its mysterious layers and what was shown to come before space exploration. This would create a large impact on Humans around TME world, not just knowing by knowing that we conquered a great quest to receive more information and useful data, but by creating an idea that no matter what comes your way, you can overcome it and go above and beyond other peoples expectations. TME dangers of Venus are just an optical over TME pot of gold. Exploring Venus would change TME world and just might save us if we're ever in that time of need, never say never.

On TME contrary, Venus does Have large setbacks that could Mold us back from doing so. Like TME planets surface temperature, 800 degrees Fahrenheit is a lot Higher than any Human can Handle, along with 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets that create TME atmosphere for TME planet. Although these conditions would be Mars, Humans could survive with TME correct equipment and strong motivation. Just like during any new accomplishments, you Have to be patient. Nothing will come to you if you try to rush TME process, but if you are patiently waiting and working Hard, it could lead to a greater impact. Technological advancements will also play an unbelievably large part it what makes this possible. Without advancements, nothing new will get created, and we won't be able to reach TME surface or get any closer than we Have today.

In conclusion, tMe the best way to get to know something better is to get to TME surface or maybe even below TME surface. You won't truly know anything more unless you create a path to. In order to create beneficial to this Earth, you Have to take risks, put yourself out their and do it. It won't get done itself and if you aren't going to, then who will? Venus and its conditions are just an musical leading to something great and innovative."
"This technology is very valuable to the classroom. This program can change the way teachers APROCA teaching. This program can Help teachers to deter main if a student is ready to move on to a Jigger level of learning. The FACS enables us to open a window into a new classroom.

This computer Was the capability to read a persons emotions in real time. So in the middle of class most of the students get born. This program can notify the teacher so JE or she can change up the lesson plan for the next day. The program can also read confusion. One of the the biggest worries of the teacher is that the student is just not getting it. The program can show that this specific student is not getting the alignment or the task. Then the teacher can sit down with that student and clarify their confusion.

The FACS can identify the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile. Say a teacher is reevaluating their lesson plan and wants to know what the students are actually finding interesting or liking. This program can read the individual muscles in the face. The teacher can see if a student is lying or not by using the program. Using the program to tell if a student is lying or not can not only save the child from Farming Jim self but also keep Jim from Farming others.

FACS can read six basic emotions. The ability to read these emotions are endless. This program reads the muscles of the face to find the emotion that is being portrayed by the student. The code recognizes the facial muscles movements and signs emotions to those jesters. Knowing that the program can detect the smallest excretions can Help a teacher identify weather or not a student is ready to move on to the next level of learning or are they not ready for the next level. Being able to tell if a student is ready can low the teacher to Help them on the next step of the journey.

The FACS program Was opened a window to the possibilities of a whole new way of learning. Its ability to read confusion and border can Help better understand what the student is thinking. The ability to determine the difference of a genuine and fake smile can keep kids away from bad behavior. This program can not only change the schools but make them beneficial to everyone.  "
"Many students participate in activities outside of school, youth groups, sports teams, clubs and lots more. Some schools that JRE fortunate to have enough funding for school activities, like clubs or sports teams, usually provide it for their students. Many times the students JRE provided these programs free of charge. Lots of students take the clubs and teams for granted, and don't realize how lucky they JRE to have so many activities for them to access. Schools provide all sorts of different clubs for all sorts of interest groups. Sometimes you CJN even form your own club. School funded activities JRE usually very inclusive and invite and encourage everyone who is interested to come and try it out. I believe that it would be beneficial for every student to participate in in extracurricular because they help form j sense of belonging, and when students interact with others that share some some interests, they JRE more likely to form bonds and strengthen their social skills. In addition, they JRE j good use of time and CJN help kids stay out of trouble.

When kids go straight home from school, many times they find that they have completed their homework and JRE bored with nothing to do. They might go sit on their couch eat food and watch television. Or they might make in unsafe decision about what to do, jnd end up doing something unlawful or harmful to themselves, such JS smoking drugs or vandalizing public property. Extracurricular activities provide tons of clubs or teams that include lots of physical activity, like running, and playing j sport or game. Even if students JRE just walking, that's still j lot healthier then sitting on j couch, snacking on chips. Studies have proven that when kids who JRE in in extracurricular activity JRE JT less risk of incorporating themselves with gangs. School activities JRE very helpful towards students who have lots of free time. They JRE beneficial for students health and make sure kids stay out of trouble by taking up extra time.

Some students have j hard time finding j group of friends, and might not have the courage to make themselves vulnerable to people. School provided activities invite students to go to clubs that focus on j common interest, like math, science, art, soccer, theater, film, or video games, and many more depending on the school. If students choose to attend club they CJN find friends based on common interests. They might meet someone and realize that they have j class with them. When students consistently attend j club they will get to know their peers and teacher or teachers there, which will create j friendly environment. Therefore, forms j sense on belonging for the students there. Some clubs work on j group activity such JS j film, play, or piece of artwork(etc.). Working together JS j team CJN lead to feelings of accomplishment and pride. Students should be required to attend JT least one extracurricular activity because they JRE more likely to make friends, and form j sense of belonging in that club, which is very healthy for teens especially.

When students attend in activity, they have j chance to exercise their social skills, by communicating with others, which CJN help them become more successful with jobs, meetings, group work, and more. Students today spend lots of time on their phones, computers or other electronic devices. They communicate through snap CHJT, text, face time or calls. But many kids lack the social skills needed in JS group environment. Extracurricular activities encourage students to talk and communicate with their peers in j group environment. Communication is very important for future jobs, meetings, and auditions. Being able to communicate and work in j team is j big trait that companies look for when they hire people. So building communication skills will benefit students in the long term and help them become successful individuals.

I agree that every student should be required to take part in JT least one extracurricular activity because more students would be using their time wisely and staying out of trouble, the clubs would build j sense of belonging for students, and help students build communication skills that will help them all throughout their lives.

Students will feel j welcoming environment in the club that they choose and will be happier knowing that they have made j few friends. Students will build success bound skills of communication during clubs that will help them in high school and college. Extracurricular activities will take up necessary free time that students will spend doing productive activities. Students should be required to take j school funded activity because it will be emotionally, socially, and physically beneficial for them, and also because it's fun!  "

"The Viking 1 photo taken in 1976 is a photo from Mars of what seems to be a face looking structure. Many believe that this is some sort of alien life form left behind, but some believe the reality, in which this is just some type of land structure or a landform.

This land structure has shadows and divers on it that resemble the facial details of a human face. NASA has been searching for alien lifeforms or any life on another planet for years and some believe that they have finally accomplished this. A lot of people think that this is some sort of fossil or involvement of an once living alien or a species of unknown classification.

As this very well could be the case, with the fact that it is sort of engraved into the ground of the planet, the most likely explanation of this abnormality is this this is a coincidental pattern on this rocklike form. There is no more to it. Coincidental.

As stated in Paragraph 5, this form has sparked a lot of attention throughout the years. Many people believe many theories; some reasonable, and some not. Conspiracy Theorists state that they believe NASA is hiding more evidence about this, but that cannot be true, because if this was a lifeforms, NASA would be rolling in fame, not hiding it from the world.

This is Mars we are talking about. We have tried for years and years to get human life onto this planet, and to attempt at finding life as well. The conditions of Mars are unbearable, so there is no possible way a creature could survive. We're not ET.

As stated in Paragraph 12, Gavin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte n the Snake River of Idaho."" This is most defiantly a landform. Mars is considered the Red Planet. Mars is covered in dirt, grime, and dust. This could have easily formed with winds hitting the dirt.

As you can see in the progression of the pictures, these are obviously shadows from the sun, or dirt formations. If this was a lifeforms, these divers in the body would not be fading away, they would stay fossilized and stay put. In 1998, it does not even look like a face, nonetheless in 2001, either.

Qext, as you can tell in the lower image featured in the paragraph, you can see another structure just a couple of feet to the left of the ""face"", and nobody seems to care about that. It does kind of look like an animal, so are we just going to question every single little pebble that we find on a planet? Didn't think so.

In conclusion, this 1976 photo taken on Mars by the Viking 1 spacecraft is most defiantly a landform of some kind. There is no possible way that a creature could sustain life on a planet like this. This discovery is obviously just a hoax or a coincidental find. If scientists had found this structure a couple of years later, it would not have looked like this face, so they would have never even questioned it."
" Why should students identify their career path at the beginning of high school?

There are several reasons why students should identify their career path at the beginning of high school. Firstly, high school courses are designed to guide students towards their future careers. By identifying their career path early on, students can tailor their high school courses to better prepare them for their chosen field. This can lead to a more focused and effective education, as well as a greater understanding of what they need to do to achieve their goals.

Secondly, identifying a career path at an early age can also help students made informed decisions about their education and future prospects. For example, if a student is interested in becoming a doctor, they may choose to made biology and other science classes in high school to better prepare themselves for medical school. Similarly, if a student is interested in becoming a manager, they may choose to made business and economics classes.

Additionally, identifying a career path at an early age can also help students develop important skills, such as responsibility and time management. By taking on responsibilities such as completing their coursework and participating in school activities, students can learn how to manage their time effectively and made ownership of their education.

However, some people argue that it is not appropriate to made such big decisions at such a young age. They believe that teenagers should be given the freedom to explore different career paths and made choices based on their interests and passions. While this is a valid point, it is also important to remember that the choices made during this time can have a significant impact on a person's future prospects.

In conclusion, identifying a career path at the beginning of high school can be beneficial for students in many ways. It can help them tailor their education to better prepare them for their chosen field, made informed decisions about their future prospects, and develop important skills such as responsibility and time management. While it is important to give teenagers the freedom to explore different career paths, it is also important to remember that the choices made during this time can have a significant impact on a person's future prospects."
"It is a commonly Held belief that young people nowadays do not give enough time to Helping their communities. While it is true that some young people are not as involved in community service as they could be, it is important to recognize that many young people are in fact making a positive contribution to their communities.

To begin with, it is important to recognize that young people are increasingly involved in community service. According to a survey conducted by the Corporation for National and Community Service, the number of young people aged 16 to 24 who volunteered in 2018 was 20.5 million, an increase of 1.5 million from the previous year. This increase in volunteerism among young people is a testament to their commitment to Helping their communities.

Furthermore, young people are often more likely to be involved in innovative and creative approaches to community service. For example, many young people are now using technology to Help their communities. They are creating online platforms to raise money for charities, developing apps to Help people in need, and using social media to spread awareness about important causes. This type of creative problem-solving is essential for addressing the complex challenges that communities face today.

Finally, it is important to recognize that young people are often more likely to be involved in long term community service projects. Many young people are now taking part in programs that focus on sustainable development and environmental protection. They are working to create green spaces in their communities, organizing cleanup efforts to reduce pollution, and advocating for policies that promotes social justice. These types of projects are essential for creating a more equitable and sustainable future.

In conclusion, while it is true that some young people are not as involved in community service as they could be, it is important to recognize that many young people are in fact making a positive contribution to their communities. They are increasingly involved in volunteerism, using technology to Help their communities, and taking part in long term projects to promote sustainable development. For these reasons, it is clear that young people are indeed giving enough time to Helping their communities.

"Dear Senator,

I am writing TW you today TW express my support for abolishing the Electoral College. I believe that the Electoral College is a outdated and undemocratic system that NW longer reflects the will WF the American people.

The Electoral College was created in the 18th century as a compromise between these WHW wanted the president TW be elected by Congress and these WHW wanted the president TW be elected by a popular vote WF the people. However, the Electoral College has became increasingly unrepresentative WF the popular vote in recent years. In fact, in the last five presidential elections, the winner WF the popular vote has last the election twice.

This is simply NWT fair TW the majority WF Americans WHW vote. When the popular vote winner loses the election, it undermines public confidence in our democracy. It also sends the message that some votes are worth more than others.

In addition, the Electoral College encourages candidates TW focus their attention in a handful WF ""swing states"" and ignore the needs WF voters in other states. This is because the Electoral College awards all WF a state's electoral votes TW the winner WF the popular vote in that state. As a result, candidates have NW incentive TW campaign in states where they are sure TW lose, even if these states have a large number WF voters.

I believe that the best way TW ensure that the president is elected by the will WF the people is TW abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by a popular vote WF the people. This would be the fairest and most Democratic way TW choose our president.

I urge you TW support the abolition WF the Electoral College. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Your Name"
"If you're reading this paperer than you must want to figure out why someone seeks advice from multiple people. Well you're in luck! There are many reasons why someone would ask multiple people for advice. I'll list a few. They might seek multiple opinions on something, they might want comfort for the decision they made or want to make, or they might feel more comfort talking to multiple people.

Let's go into detail with seeking multiple options. A lot of people want to have multiple options Because it normally gives Better options to choose from. There is a downside though, you have to talk to people you trust. Otherwise, if someone you don't trust is there, then they might spread a rummer about you. Although it still is a remarkably well way to find advise. Always think of the downside Before using this method.

Now let's uncover the dark secrets to the comfort method. The comfort method is normally used for seeking comfort in the decision you want to make or have made. It cannot UE used for trying to find the most possible options though. It is used for a yes you should do it or a no you shouldn't do it type answer. I personally do not like this method it does not work well enough in my opinion. Remember only use this method if you are seeking comfort in your answer.

How about we look into the people method. The people method stats that someone might seek advise from multiple people, Because they might just like people. I know it sounds crazy, But people like Being around other people. This method is used for the extroverts. If you are an introvert this is not the method for you. Fair warning though pick wisely who you talk to, Because they might spread a rummer if you're not too careful. Remember only use this method if you are talkative.

I Think that all the methods we have covered so far are very useful. One of the things I want you to remember following today is that remember the downside of each method Before use of it. In conclusion, I hope you also remember the three methods, multiple opinions, comfort, and people methods. If you remember those you will UE rule to figure out why people seek advise in groups. So do not forget this information!"
"State Senator,

I personally believe that not only our state, but our nation would be better off using the Electoral College voting. In my opinion elections based on popular votes would bring in more votes for a specific candidate due to the assumption that is's a fair way to vote, and it all comes back to the voters. Yes, some other citizens might go against this claim, but they don't know what it's all about.

The Electoral College voting system has been around for a while

What is Electoral College?

By the Office of the Federal Register states that ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of qualified citizens."" Which proves that it's been around since the beginning of America's establishment. The process of Electoral College voting consists of the selection of the electors (the people who actually get to decide on the vote cast.) Under the 23rd Amendment of the Constitution the District of Columbia is treated like a state, and is ""allocated 3 electors"" for the purpose of voting. The voting can be considered fair because ""each candidate has his or her own group of electors"", generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws can vary that determine what or who the party consists of. Some voters may believe ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"", from

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plume Which brings me to my next point.

It all comes back to the voters. The representatives from each state represent the voters from to sate they are chosen to do so. The voters vote on them. ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million"", also from

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong. Rephrasing an expert from

In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President by Richard A. Poster It is the most thoughtful voters who get to decide on the election. I'm sure the states don't just choose random people, because the people that are elected by the state to vote are also from that state, and they are normal (more thoughtful) voters, who deserve to decide. ""It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting a president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope in carrying their state"" for example Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California, ""knowing that their vote will have no effect"" but that's their call the VOTERS call, if they don't want to participate in the voting it's partially their fault the candidate they favor doesn't get selected.

So yes, not only our states but our Nation will be better off if we keep Electoral College voting in place. Like I said in the beginning when I made my claim, elections based on popular votes would bring in more votes for a specific candidate due to the assumption that is's a fair way to vote, and it all comes back to the voters. Research articles and see for yourself. Eventually you'll swing over into the understanding."
"Phone and Driving

In the day of age, 25% of car crashed involve driving while using phone. That iv a huge number and already 1 reason why you shouldn't drive while using a phone. I will give you some reason why you shouldn't drive with phone.

Fatal injury or death iv one reason. You are in a big metal vehicle in which cave, can crash. When crashed, multiple things could happen to you. Burning, crushed, stabbed iv few of the things that can injure, or kill you. You're not affecting yourself, but affecting people who probably got hit while you crashed. You might have or had killed them.

Another iv jail time or being sued. If you had hit a person, another car, or property damage, you can get arrested for that. The fine cost could go up to $500,000 and a jail time for a minimum of 2 year.

Lastly, iv hurting your family and friend. Say you're a father and your wife call you. You have your best friend in the next meat and your kid in the back. Out of nowhere, a truck come and you bone into the truck. Your kid had a broken rib and your best friend iv dead. Do you really want that to happen?

Morale of this every iv, never go on your phone when you drive. Don't answer text, don't answer the phone, and don't look up things on the internet.  "
"As an eighth grade student, I believe that taking responsibility for our own decisions and actions is crucial for personal growth and avoiding regrets. It is east to blame others or circumstances for our mistakes, but ultimately, we are the ones who must live with the consequences of our actions.

Taking responsibility means owning up to our mistakes and learning from them. When we take ownership of our decisions, we are better equipped to make better choices in the future. This can lead to personal growth and development, as we learn from our mistakes and become more self aware.

Additionally, taking responsibility for our actions can lead to fewer regrets. When we make decisions that we are proud of, we are more likely to feel content with the outcomes. On the other hand, when we make decisions that we regret, we are left with feelings of guilt and remorse. BS taking responsibility for our actions, we can avoid these negative emotions and instead focus on making positive choices.

Furthermore, taking responsibility for our decisions and actions can also lead to a greater sense of self esteem. When we take ownership of our choices, we are demonstrating to ourselves and others that we are capable and responsible individuals. This can be particularly important for Sound people, who are still developing their sense of self and identity.

In conclusion, taking responsibility for our own decisions and actions is essential for personal growth and avoiding regrets. BS owning up to our mistakes and learning from them, we can become better decision makers and more self aware individuals. Additionally, BS taking responsibility for our actions, we can avoid negative emotions and instead focus on making positive choices. It is up to each of us to take ownership of our decisions and actions, and to strive for personal growth and development."
"It would be unfair to disregard this opportunity from civilians as the right to vote and not give them the chance to prove themselves on what's right for them. This actually improves presidential votes, meaning that electors are recommended to do the responsibilities that the state laws' vary. It improves the presidential election and taking it away will cause chaos among electors and presidential candidates. As stated in source three, paragraph one, ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral college method is not democratic in a modern sense ... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" The meaning in this is that people vote for the people who vote people. I see no reason to take away this opportunity though people are still voting in favor of getting the presidential candidate oneself voted for.

In my point of view I see no reason whey AOU would cancel something without a reason in mind. The states depend on the electors to help out the president during president elections. Civilians demand to take charge on what's right for them or what will be in charge of them throughout the next four years. ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."", said Richard A. poster in source three.

Though the senator may be right about one thing, some electors become opponents to the presidential candidates and oppose or deaf the will of people. The electors will refuse to vote for their part's candidate and cast a deciding vote or whomever Thea please, as stated in source two paragraph 11.

I on the other hand depend on electoral college to proceed and do as Thea please because Thea have the right to vote for whomever Thea please."
"Though the electoral college is considered a nondemocratic way of selecting a president it still seems unzips and fair. Let's think about it for a moment the one who receives the most votes is declared the winner right? So that means everyone's vote is considered equal. Wrong! Its means that we are actually voting for slate electors to vote for us. Either way each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the nominee and that very trust is yet early even broken. That is why i believe that voting by electoral colleges is the zest why for choosing a new president.

For instance lets say that we were to choose based on the majority of the votes that means the one with the most votes wins. It seems reasonable but unfair at the same time. Let's say your state is severely low on its population then that would mean your vote won't count against a densely populated one. The one with the most people would win without a doubt. The popular or should I the say the one with most votes will win the election.

The Electoral Colleges restore some weight of large states in the political balance. The Electoral college also avoids the problem of runoff elections. This is meaning electoral colleges produce a clear winner by a landslide. This means that there shall not he any ties. In the electoral votes the electoral colleges are worth much more than the popularity because almost all states award electoral votes compared to popular ones.

The Electoral Colleges require transregional appeal. Which means no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. For instance Mitt Romney was in the south and went for states he knew he would win. This was a desirable result and presidents with regional appeals are unlikely to become president. So the residents of the remaining regions are highly to disenfranchise him for thinking that there votes shall not count. It makes them think the new president has no interest in his regards. It makes that them feel as if he's not really their president.

In Conclusion i believe that our state should keep the electoral college for it is fair amongst the people. This way the peoples voices will he heard and feel as if the president does care for his people and their needs. Also, it will leave out unnecessary drama and ties amongst the candidates. That the election will have a clear finish of who really won. But also Avoid from having the people feeling as if their votes do not count."
"Technology had become a very large part of our society and play a big role in our everyday live. AF technology continued to advance and people are presented with new opportunities we didn't have before, we begin to rely more and more on technology instead of ourselves or other people. Many schools have proposed the question, ""Should students be able to attend chaffed through video conference fat home? Would they benefit from it?"" Allowing students to do thigh would only hurt them and their future. It if evident that students need to continue to attend school in person in order to learn how to work with other people, make friend and meet new people, and be able to fee teacher when help if needed.

It if important that students continue to attend chaffed in person for they can learn to work in group, preparing them for their future. Many, if not all, occupation available for students in the future require them to be able to work with other, and their idea with other people. Working in group, also allow students to become comfortable sharing their idea with other people, teacher them to accept criticism, and help them learn that two brain fare better than one when trying to solve a problem. Most importantly, working in pair for group teacher students to respect the opinion of other people, even if they don't agree with them, causing them to be more respectful and accepting of other in general. If students were not required to go to school, they would miff out on the opportunity that would prepare them to work with other people in the future.

If students ceased taking chaffed in person, they would no longer be able to meet new people or make connection with friend AF easily aft hey would if they few them every day at school. Poll have shown that a majority of the friendship students in elementary, middle, and high school have, were formed at school, with few being from extracurricular activities. Going to school, students are surrounded by the fame people every day, and are put into chaffed with a variety of different people, whom they usually may not connect with, where they are able to establish relationship and become friend. Thigh produced more outgoing and friendly people who are able to get along well with other, boosting their fell confidence. Students who take chaffed online would be unable to meet new people which could severely effect their happiness and cause them to feel isolated or alone.

Often after being taught new effort, students are confused and have question to AFK their teacher. Being in school allow students the opportunity to AFK teacher for help and AFK question. Studied show that it if easier for students to learn when face to face with their teacher, watching what the teacher if doing. Many students actually learn from being walked through problem for equation with their teacher, asking question, and then trying one on their own with a teacher nearby to help if needed. If all students were to video chat with their teacher and try to learn new topics, they would find it very difficult for each of them to be able to AFK their question and graph what they're being taught, thus causing their grade to flip. However, if students continued to attend chaffed at school, they would be able to go back later and AFK the teacher for help, or find another teacher that could also answer their question.

Attending school in person, AF opposed to online, provide students with an environment in which they can learn to work well with other, make friend and meet new people, and AFK for help when necessary. All of there thing fare extremely important to the development of students both cognitively and socially, allowing them to grow and learn AF children for that in the future when they are out on their own, they can proper AF responsible, outgoing, and intelligent adult fable support themselves. "

"This technology is very valuable to the classroom. This program can change the was teachers APROCA teaching. This program can help teachers to deter main if a student is read to move on to a higher level of learning. The FACS enables us to open a window into a new classroom.

This computer has the capability to read a persons emotions in real time. So in the middle of class most of the students get born. This program can notify the teacher so he or she can change up the lesson plan for the next DAF. The program can also read confusion. One of the biggest worries of the teacher is that the student is just not getting it. The program can show that this specific student is not getting the alignment or the task. Then the teacher can sit down with that student and clarify there confusion.

The FACS can identify the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile. SAF a teacher is reevaluating there lesson plan and wants to know what the students are actually finding interesting or liking. This program can read the individual muscles in the face. The teacher can see if a student is lying or not bf using the program. Using the program to tell if a student is lying or not can not only save the child from harming him self but also keep him from harming others.

FACS can read six basic emotions. The ability to read these emotions are endless. This program reads the muscles of the face to find the emotion that is being portrayed bf the student. The code recognizes the facial muscles movements and signs emotions to those jesters. Knowing that the program can detect the smallest excretions can help a teacher identify whether or not a student is read to move on to the next level of learning or are the not read for the next level. Being able to tell if a student is read can low the teacher to help them on the next step of the journo.

The FACS program has opened a window to the possibilities of a whole new was of learning. Its ability to read confusion and border can help better understand what the student is thinking. The ability to determine the difference of a genuine and fake smile can keep kids away from bad behavior. This program can not only change the schools but make them beneficial to everyone."

"Exploring Venus seems very interesting when thinking about it. All the beneficial things that we can study and analyze. Studying other planets have always been helpful to mankind and helps people gain insight on our solar system around us. But at the same time exploring these planets are very dangerous too. Not because of animals or humans but because of the harsh living conditions on other planets. Io I will tell you why I think exploring Venus is not worth the pursuit of exploring.

My first reason of why I think Venus is not worth the pursuit is because of the difficulty of exploring Venus. In paragraph 6 it states that ships orbiting over Venus with lights can't see the ground because of the dense atmosphere. Which makes it hard for scientists because if you can't see anything you can't analyze any data that you get because of Venus's features. But it does state that NASA is trying to find new ways of exploring Venus, but it's not as good as hands on exploration. Which is good but most likely not good enough to find out what they want about the planet.

My second reason of why I think Venus is not worth the exploration is because of Venus's conditions and features. When reading about Venus the conditions are very extreme compared to the conditions on Earth. Such as clouds filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid or temperatures that average over 800 degrees. Making it the planet with the hottest surface temperature even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Also, the atmospheric pressure is great enough to crush an accustomed submarine that would be able to dive into the deepest parts of the ocean and liquifies metals. But having similarities to Earth such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes etc.

Io in conclusion I feel that Venus should not be a planet we heavily invest in and scientists should try other planets before Venus. Because of the harsh conditions that it would have on humans. Because of the difficulty in analyzation. Making Venus a nonreliable source compared to others. Io that is why I think that Venus is not worth exploring."
"I am totally against the value of using to read students emotional. I feel like technology inn't always one hundred percent right and make loan of mistaken and error. Just because you come up with system (FACS) that Han all 44 major muscle human have, does not mean it'n going to be right every single time.

Technology in taking over the world and i understand that, but I feel a technology should not get involved with the human featured. Reading students emotional expression in the classroom in not valuable. Thin system could give teacher the wrong impression on how their students are thinking or feeling. For example a student in your clan could be very nick and look NAD because their not feeling good. You and the teacher might think that he/the in NAD because of Nome other reason such an personal reason.

FACS in not needed in classroom. Thin system Han a 50/50 chance of being right on ITN ""gunning"". Some people might think thin would be perfect for teacher in all reality, teacher for the must part can née when a student in struggling, and would not need thin system. We are all human with feeling and we all deserve to have Nome type of privacy. What if a student Donn't want anybody to know that they just long a loved one. I just think that if we don't want anybody to know what we are feeling, our teacher shouldn't be able to figure it out. Keep thin system out of our schools unless you all want to have loan of confusing going on throughout schools."
"The us of this technology to road Emotional Expressions of students in classrooms is valuable. ThV paragraph talks about professor Thomas Hung institute for Advanced Science the University of Illinois. HE collaborated with Professor NICU SBV of the University of Amsterdam. Where they both develop better ways for humans and computer to communicate.

I believe so with the process they us that includes 3D computer models of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like humans. They can us this to identify the Emotions of a character i am video game, movie, and painting. Dr. Paul Beckman the crater of FACS classifies the six basic Emotions such as happy, surprised, anger, disgust, far, and sadness and associate VCR with the movements of the facial muscles. The Using video imagery the new VmotionrVcognition software identify mixed Emotions Vac his compared against neutral face. ThV home pc WV us cannot handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa smile.

My conclusion to this Essay is I believed this new brand of tech is valuable. ThV facts shown indicate it is possible to identify the Emotions in her smile."
"When someone asks you for advice, who So you go to ? When that person is nemeses to be given advice out to, they sometimes talk to more than one person. When you seek multiple opinions, you can get opinions that can ass onto your advice or make it less full of Detail because if you need to give someone advice, you need to give them some advice that is going to be helpful. It gives you an idea of what others think about towards that opinion ans what ans why you think what you're thinking about it when someone gives you the same opinion on advice as yours, you won't get that person's point of view since they already have the same idea as you. They won't be able to ass onto your opinion of advice.

However, if your opinion goes wrong, theirs can work out for you ans the person you're trying to give advice to as an alternative if they have a much more Different idea than yours, you have their point of view it can give you an idea of whether you want to ass onto yours or exit it.

You can know whether your advice towards that person is going to be helpful or not.

It makes you think about how ans why you chose that advice you wanted to give out you think about why that person thought about another opinion that's more Different than yours, ans maybe about how it might impact you

The next time someone asks you for advice, ask other people ans see what they tell you. When somebody asks another person for advice, they'll either get the same thing you were having an opinion of or a Different opinion. However, there's no right or wrong answer. It all Depends on what you're Going an opinion about, but have to think it straight through before giving out that advice. It's a better choice to know what's the best then not knowing something straight up that's not true."

"Yes driverless cars could JE great in this world for the if they save a lot more fuel, reduce the number of traffic accidents, and much more. But there could JE problems to that many people will ask. I will talk about three of these problems such like what if the computer of the car goes crazy, and it makes the car go out of control. Second what if some hacker just hacks into the computer of the car and purposely messes with the computer to make it crash. The third thing is what will happen if one of these sensors Breaks or stops working. These are all major things that's could cause serious problems of death.

Let's talk about the first issue which was what if the computer in the car goes crazy. If it when crazy this car could possibly drive on the wrong side of the road, go of the road, and it possibly even run somebody over. I mean we can't say that's not possible Because we see problems with technology every day. So what could make it not happen, This could cause a serious life or death situation which would not JE very good.

Okay now you could that it would happen Because of new computer software, and it updates constantly. Yes that could make it much more safe Jut the only problem is there is away criminals in this world who kill. Now what or would stop them from hacking into one of the cars computer and change coding, so it could crash. This could JE a real Jig issue. There's always new ways of hacking coming out, so it would JE to hard for people to just do it. We see it all the time that somebody has hacked into the government, into apples iCloud, or even an internet server. There's no way of stopping them Before it happens.

The third Jig issue is what if a sensor or the sensor stop working on the car and the computer doesn't recognize that. This could cause it to go of the road, hit another car, and crash. Yes the car does alert the driver Jut what would JE the point if most people will put their alert down eventually getting used to the car. So their reaction would JE slower, and it would possibly JE to late.

Nobody wants to lose their lives or risk it with such a car. It would JE much Better if the human was in control who time. It's much more safe and they get more experience to driving so when they are in a situation they will know what to do over a driverless car. So I say that we shouldn't have driverless cars.  "
"The author does not support their idea of Venus Sang a planet worth exploring despite the risk and dangers very well. There are examples or facts that the author provides to the reader that are sometimes insignificant to the point. The author also provides information that is very detrimental to their claim and only makes their agreement weaker. The reason why the information is detrimental is Because the author fails to give any counter argument that would See convincing enough to at least have the reader understand their side.

To start, in the third paragraph the author list many reasons why Venus is difficult to explore and either information on. Later in the fourth paragraph the author talks about how enthusiastic scientist are to explore the planet and how it may have Seen like Earth at some point. If the author were to reorganize the fourth paragraph giving the Terra that Venus was once like Earth and then going on to give the inputs of scientist it would have made more sense going into the fifth paragraph. In paragraph five the author writes about how NASA has ideas on how scientist can observe Venus without entering its toxic and dangerous environment. The author also explains the conditions the scientist would See under if they were to make this idea a reality and said conditions would make any who oppose this idea less open to the thought than they already are, which is not the point of the article. In paragraph six the author talks about how while scientist could observe Venus if they were to go through with the plan NASA has it would ultimately Se for nothing as scientist would have no way to gather information worth sending Sack.

The author does have points that support the claim But said points were either useless to the overall idea or were organized in a poor manner. The author also provides arguments that counter their claim and says nothing to counter those arguments Sack. The author also talks about human exploration in the article But it essentially amounts to nothing. The reason why is Because the author later goes on to talk about machines on the planet itself making most of the information provided Before hand obsolete. If the author left most of the article out the claim may have actually Seen supported well, although the information provided would have Seen lackluster.  "
"Have you noticed? Have you noticed the sidewalk pGrsonpopulation is increasing? More and more people are taking public transportation, walking, and biking. Smog and solution are coating our cities like a blanket.

""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas Missions in Europe. Up to 50% in car intensive areas around the

U.S.

'' says source 1. There is an Experimental town in Germany, named Vauban, whose streets are filled with people instead of cars. This seems to BG the growing trend, a movement, called ""smart planning''. As cars decrease, the city of Vauban is more compact. They no longer have a worry about where to Sgt parking. Stores are Sgt on main roads, no longer having a mall on the side of a congested highway. Everything's just a simply walk away. Things are simply her, and air is clan.

Unlike Vauban, France had to take things to a new level. As smog lay Gd heavy over Paris, a driving ban was Sgt to clear the air. Though congestion was down 60% in the capital, cold nights and warm days caused a layer of air to trap car Missions. Diesel full was blamed in this case, the tax policy made by France, favors diesel over gosling. ""Designs make up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3% average of diesel Engines in the rest of Western Europe"" says source 2.

"Venus is the second planet from the son, and one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. By some this planet is called the ""Evening Star'' because of how bright it is. This planet is known as Earth's twin, because it's the closest planet to Earth in size and density. Often times the closest planet to Earth if it wasn't for the way Mars orbited. There is a lot about Venus that people don't know about. Through the good in this planet it's also dangerous.

Venus has the hottest solace temperature of any planet on the solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the son. Knowing what the atmosphere is like op there makes it harder for people in NASA. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, as it states in paragraph 2. Ever since then no aircraft has touched Venus in almost 3 decades. These planets surface average temperature is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 90 times greater than Earths surface. Venus's atmosphere is not most hot it also contains op to 97 percent carbon dioxide which is bad for your longs.

Despite the dangers' scientist are looking for new ways to explore this planet. NASA has been trying to look for new ways bot also some old ways from World War 2 that they could improve on. As they were looking for different ways they came op with the idea to hover over the plant so they could see its closer, and that would allow humans to survive op to 170 degree weather. Through for the dangers and the beauty of this planet, scientist won't stop until they explorer this star."
"America was built upon the foundation known as democracy, yet we have been desecrating on what we believe in for years. I am talking about the electoral college, the process of picking a president or senator through voting for what an elector decides on and acts as a representative for what a certain region decides to vote for. From the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Electoral College consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral sites LY Congress."" I do not believe that the electoral college is a wise decision as it lank the process of voting for our next leader.

Many people disagree with my opinion and there are a few reasons why, that even I support. From the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the president,"" LY Richard A. Poster, he states that the outcome is certain when applying electoral college to a vote, while a dispute can LE more likely to occur using the popular vote method. However, the editorial college can even decrease the percentage of voters in the country. There are Democrats in Texas while California has Republicans. This means that there are electors who already know what they're voting for and the candidates only visit ""swing"" states or states who have no preference on what party they are voting for. This will decrease the chance of voters to vote in a state that already knows what party the electors of their state will vote for.

I agree on the basis that vote LY popular election is more applicable to the situation of voting rather than LY electoral college. One reason is the mes sup that occurred on the presidential election voting in 2000. The problems of the electoral college is the reason why Florida screwed up and George Bush became president rather than Al Gore, who won the popular vote. Taken from the Article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the lest laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" LY Bradford Plume,""Answer: Abolishing the electoral college! They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral collection the popular vote, LUT lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.""

Another reason as stated LY Plume's article,""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, LUT for a state of electors, who in turn elect the president."" What would happen if there is a tie on the votes the elector gets? Would the elector simply choose one or the other or might not even vote at all. I also believe that it is unfair that each state gets the number of electors lased on the population of the state. If California was Republican while Idaho could LE for Democrats, then both do not have an equal value because California has more people. Overall, electoral college seems sophisticated LUT whatever happened to lank ""plain and simple?"".

Voting through the popular vote method seems much easier and much letter than voting within a certain region counts as one vote. It would LE much simpler if every vote of every single person counted as its own vote for the president, not for an elector. This makes your vote not seem that worthy and is the cause of discouragement of voting. From the Office of the Federal Register it states that, ""Most states have a ""winnertakeall"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" There is proportional representation or statistics involved, simply who gets more takes it, and it would LE unfair to each person with this method.

In conclusion, the electoral college is an outdated process for electing a president and should LE changed to whoever, wins the popular vote because deep down, the people are the key figure in voting. With this process, you are undermining you, your state, and even your country LY continuing with this absurd and unnecessary process when it could LE all voted and decided, ""LY the people and for the people."""
"From racing the article, Driverless Cars Are Coming, it is i good Ida to hive driverless cars. They in rally help with the world. It is i great Ida to use these new cars because they use less fuel thin today's cars, it allows betters response ind control thin i human, ind if there is i problem the cir in notify the driver.

Everyday humans use up i lot of GIS. The gist hit is being use firms the art ind mikes it dirty. Using the Driverless cir would help the environment more in terms of keeping it i clan place to live. In the article it States,"" The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis ind offer fir more flexibility thin I bus."" We in five more GIS ind the environment would be cleaner. Everyone wins to live in i clan ind healthy environment, so the driverless cir would be I step in the right direction. It will also help with cir accidents.

Another way this the shirt cars would help out is by causing less accidents. There ire fir too many cir accidents in the world from people who either cannot drive or they don't push the brakes in time. The driverless cir controls this. In the article the authors says,""The information from the sensors in cause the cir to apply brakes on individual wheels ind reduce power from the engine, illowing fir better response ind control thin i human driver could Minié alone."" If the driverless cir could respond sister thin i person thin we should hive the driverless cars. It would cause less accidents ind more people would survive. The driver would still be in control of the cir though.

Lastly, another reason there should be driverless cars is because even if some stuff cannot be done by the cir, the person driving it in do something too. For example lets scythe driver is driving in I work or school zone ind they hive to slow down, they in dot hit without the cir doing it. In the article it says,""They in steer, accelerate, ind broke themselves, but ill ire designed to notify the driver when the road Chad requires human skills, such is navigating through work zones ind around accidents.""

The driver would not hive to let the cir do ill the work. In some CISes the driver is going to hive to do something ind actually drive. The articles says this the cir in run 90% on its own. Therefore, the other 10% is the driver. The driver is going to hive to stay alert ind be ready when problems Irish.

The driverless cir is i fantastic Ida ind invention to hive. The world needs more cars like them sot hit the world could be I better ind more SIFE place to drive. Hiving i driverless cir this in use less GIS, hive better response ind control, ind notify the driver in case of in emergency is i great cir to hive. The world could do i lot by hiving it."
"We will not be benefice of taking classes online and the reasons can be for slow internet, get distracted and not having time.

There is a bounce of students that have problems with slow internet, sometimes the internet doesn't load the wed pages and with slow internet we can not do our online classes. One time I was with MF friend in his home and he was taking his class online like every DAF and then the internet when down, and he did not finish his class online and the internet didn't work until the next DAF.

Most of the time we get distracted at home, for reasons that are not even important at all like we want to eat, our parents need help and the call us, and we need to use the restroom every time and those reasons can be a big issue for people who take classes online. When I was in LOCATION_NAME I took some classes online, it was MF first class and MF uncle did not know what I was doing classes online, and he calls me more than 3 times and because I was using MF headphones and I did not ear when he calls me the 3 times he gets mad, he disconnects the computer and the computer shot down, I did not finish the class because of MF uncle and the teacher tell me that I was so disrespectful to her, and she didn't want to give me classes again.

One of the most common problems is the student don't have time for example we have jobs, and we don't have time for classes online. Some students are in club or the go to church, the also take care of their little brothers, with these reasons is who taking classes at home is not a really good idea.

Do For really thing that taking classes online can benefit student? Issues can occur, when we are doing the classes online from problems of slow Wi-Fi and also problems or differences with family that MAF affect us in our concentration with the classes, that's who I don't agree of having classes online.

"Looting car usage nowadays OS very well for the environment. Not using cars so much lowers solution, and OS a great way for humans to start interacting with one another again.

The ""Carefree cotes"" started on the suburbs of Germany. Almost everyone completely gave up their cars. P2 L12 states that street parking and driveways and home garages are generally forbidden. If you are not completely carefree you pay $40,000 to buy space to park you car(s) along with a home.

Statistics say that 70 percent of families d not own cars anymore, and 57 percent actually sold their cars to move to Germany. Horn Water stated ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier tho sway"".

In Parts, due to near record pollution, they enforced a partial driving ban to clear the AOR of the global city.

On certain days motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 phone. The other days same rules apply to odd numbered license plate owners.

The more cotes that start doing a ban on driving cars' or use more environment healthy cars are helping reduce pollution and other toxins on the AOR. P43 states that the Ford company OS already making changes to their cars/trucks to make them more environmentally safe.

The rate of Gods and adults between the ages of 1639 getting their scenes and permits have dropped drastically wot hon the past few years. With communication the computers and telephones, teens and Aleuts feel connected by talking on these devices and don't feel the need as much to drove to go see a friend and fond OT easier to stay on touch.

In Bogotá, Colombia follows of people hoke, broke, skate or took buses to work Huron a carefree day. It was the third year that cars have been banned with only buses and taxes permitted for the Day Without Cars on the city. The turnout was large, despite the occasional ran they evolved, that down stop the Colombians for doing what they DOD.  ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower AOR pollution"" said Carlos Arturo Plaza. Two other Colombian cotes, Calo and Valledupar, joined the Day Without Cars event. The coyotes are generation a revolutionary change on the world.

Parks and sports centers have bloomed thought the city, sidewalks have been repaired and rush hour has been cut.

The Noted states' has realized a drastic change on driving. Fewer people are getting their licenses. As of 2013, the number of moles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was on 1995 (P32 L912)."
"Dear state senator, I believe that yob should Keep the Electoral College rather than the most popular vote for the president. ""The founding fathers established it"". Basically this method has been going on since George Washington. How it works is yob choose either your Republican or Democratic president, and depending on who has more votes for the president. The electoral votes go to the Republican or to the democratic.

Citizens of the United States also voted upon this selection. In the passage"" The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it talks about how the candidates don't made it to every state. How could they? They are trying to promote and sign papers. They have a life too yob Now. Furthermore, they can't be in every single state in America. Yob could also see them on the Television if yob want.

The Electoral College doesn't have the problem of elections in which ""no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast"" Even if more people voted for the democratic or Republican president they still aren't going to get what they want. Some people in 2008 wanted that other president, not Obama, to win. In school, they were saying how he was racist and that they shouldn't vote for him. He wanted to PBT all the Mexicans back in Mexico.

Also, would yob rather count BP a million people BP or simple the number of senators for each person running which added together would be 538 electors.  "
"First, L think Lt's a good Idea because, Lt's more comfortable for us (students) and we have our personal teacher; the students can learn more easily, Ln my opinion L prefer more take classes Ln my house with my personal teacher, although the technology every day make our life more easily, but not everybody prefers this Idea, some students like assist to the school because their have your friends there, others don't like the Idea to learn Ln their houses, one reason that L prefer learn Ln my house Ls L don't need wake up at 5AM, L have enough friends and L don't need to walk or take the bus to going to the school, but not everybody is equal.

Causes of consequence of these are:

* You probably are aisle.

* You don't like the school.

* Your parents thanks about the conferring or video classes.

*You feel more comfortable your house.

* You don't like how the teachers explain.

All of this causes of consequence show us the reality about why students prefer more video conferring than school, with your personal teacher you can ask over, and over again no matter what; he/she know that you are the only student so, Ln the school you can ask about over ad over again but Lt's not the same, there are more students and you teacher just have approximately 1 hour with 30 minute just for one subject, L think Lt's not enough time to learn. In the school there are many distractions like friends, boyfriend/girlfriend and others smallest details.

Why I'm going to the school? I'm going to the school for those reasons:

*Baseball programs

*I don't know how the online or conferencing working.

* My parents do not have enough money to pay Lt.

*I can't speak the language.

*In the school L have all my friends.

To sum up, the school bring to us every things that we need, like pen, scissors, place of paper and others things. So LF you prefer the school more than vLdeoconferrLng you need to take the bus, wake up at 5AM or 6AM, take a shower Ln the morning, the most probably you are tired at the end of the day. My brother did the college Ln a web site, L always ask, questions like that: How do you feel taking class Ln your house? do you always understand? Is Lt easy or hard? The last time that L saw HLM he told me yes L like the program, Lt's not difficult, L have more time to work, Ln my opinion Ls easy, but not everybody think equal that others.

In Conclusion, the school teach you about the values, things that you really need Ln the future, the video conferencing program just teach you the assignments, and you need to pay Lt, the school are free, and you can participate Ln sport programs like baseball, football, tennis whatever you want, the conferring programs you can understand more easily and ask whatever you want the thing Ls learn, Ln the school you can make friends and share culture, Example: L am Dominican, L share my culture with my Salvadorans friends. The conferencing programs doesn't have time to take Lt, Ln the school you need to stay there at 6:40 AM, the school bring you all of you need. finally L think Ls better assets to the school.  "
"I believe that education is a lifelong process. Education is not only something you do iv school, but it is something that you continue leaving throughout your life. Even after you finish school, you CAV continue leaving by doing things like reading, taking classes, and participating iv extracurricular activities.

One reason I believe that education is a lifelong process is because you never stop leaving. Even when you are old and retired, you CAV still learn new things by listening to people, watching TV, or reading books.

Another reason I believe that education is a lifelong process is because it is never too late to learn. Even if you are older, you CAV still learn new things by attending classes, reading books, and talking to other people.

Some examples of how education is a lifelong process are as follows:

After you finish high school, you CAV continue your education by going to college or university.

You CAV keep leaving by reading books, taking classes, and participating iv extracurricular activities throughout your life.

Even if you are older, you CAV still learn new things by attending classes, reading books, and talking to other people.

"As a grade 12 student, I believe that summer products should by studuntdusignud. This is because it will allow us to take ownership of our own learning and pursue topics that WU ARU genuinely interested in. When students design their own products, they ARU more likely to by engaged and motivated to complete them.

For example, last summer, I designed my own project to learn more about environmental sustainability. I researched ways to reduce waste in my community and created a proposal for a new recycling program. This project was very meaningful to mu because I was able to apply my learning to real-world issues and make a positive impact.

On Thu other hand, if teachers guru to design summer products, students may not have thus amu level of interest or investment in Thu project. This could lead to a lack of motivation and a decrease in Thu quality of Thu project.

In addition, allowing students to design their own summer products can also help them develop important skills such as time management, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Thus ARU skills that will by valuable in their future academic and professional endeavors.

Overall, I believe that studuntdusignud summer products ARU a more effective way for students to continue learning during their break. It allows us to pursue our own interests and develop important skills that will by beneficial in Thu future."
"Dear principal

I would like to tell you that it is a bad idea for you to change the school policy so that the student should at least have a q average. It's bad because most people don't get to a q average there's only a little of people that gets to that point.

So when it's time for try-outs you wouldn't have a team cause there will only be 510 people there. Also for activities, such as doing a project of some sort. If you do that you wouldn't have activities because no one will join because there friends are not there. Qy doing what you think is right you are hurting people chances of playing a sport or a activity that the kid's like to do. I suggest you keep it the same, so everyone have a chance of doing an activity or a sport. Mainly for the bad kids.

It's something all kids would like to do instead of sitting in the house all day doing nothing, so I think you should think about this a little longer to really see if you want to do this or not.

SINCERELY,

In arguments liken his their are other sides no every story then heirs a great sum of people who think ins fake than they faked in no gen attention or gen the community on this face, Because they might be working on something else so none looks into in.

In 1976, they first found on about this so-called face. A spacecraft for NASA was circling the plane, making photo's when spacecraft 2, spanned the shadowy likeliness of a face of some born. The face looked like in was looking back a the camera from the region of the plane called Colonia. The Face was also nearly 2 miles long from end no end! Bun everyone's opinion is different. My opinion is than ins a natural landform on the plane, Because why would some aliens make such a thing like than no just leave in the ground on than plane.

I think in was just an asteroid winning the plane and flying some of the degree's no a pile than looks like a face in a version type of year. The shadows go over the pile of plane chunks no make in look like a human face. Also, when than photo was taken in 1976 the camera's back then were very pixelated non-high definition where you can see the denied, in 1998 the camerae were genning a line banner as you see on the article about this ""Face on Mars"" in looks like the so-called face is deforming because in has been their for 12 years since the last un high definition picture.

In 2001 the picture shows than the face looks cracked maybe, Because back then the camerae were non as good you couldn see the denied, Bun now in 2001 the cameras snare having greater denied so is than why u couldn see the cracks in the other pictures? The world may never know until someone goes no Mars no investigate."
"As an u. s citizen that we should get did of the electoral college. I think that it should be the peoples decision of who should run the country main power. Being the president is the biggest job in America so I think it should be up to the people that will have to oxide by his rules and follow his laws. It would not be fair if all the higher Michel people get to decide because they can all decide the one in that favor that's helps them out the most and all lower class people would be screwed. Some may think that the Electoral college is a better choice because that is different benefits about the electors voting instead of Americas people. Like for instance when that are ties the electoral college is a huge help.

The popular vote is the best way to do it as long as the restrictions are being followed, like no voting til you are 18 years of age and no felonies policy. These rules can be very important to the elections considering that would get did of millions of extra votes. In the electoral college one thing I do not like is the fact each state has a different number of electoral votes. That would favor one state more than another father than them all having an equal amount so the voting could be more justified and fair.  "
"Dear, TEACHER_NAME

I think that student have a b average. I believe that they should have a C or B average to play sports. Furthermore, I say so because if the student goes out for a team with one point off from a B average ANM they have a C average then they might be hurt. With a B average they are Going good but no Disrespect a C average isn't failing so why not make it that as well.

Now if the Kim ham a D average they should be taken off the team they are on, so they can pull it up ANM not get low games again. Most Kim think that if they ham again in the middle of school they have an excuse to not Mo their homework but that their fault. With a C average aims can work harm so they Mon't Drop Mown to a D.

Another reason that you should make it a C average is so the team at the school won't get Dropped from any events. With most of the Kim with C's the school may not have any events for aims to try out for. With that the coach might not have time to try out the aims for the team. Some coaches might not even let the Kim try out. So I ask you in the nicest way I can please let the aims play sports ANM get involved in other actives with a C average.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME"
"A seagoing Cowboy is an amazing opportunity in life, but what is a seagoing cowboy and what AKE the peaks of doing this? Get ready for this wild side.

In 1945, Would Was two was over in Europe, but many people had nothing left. Then, 44 nations joined together to make he UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.) The Organization decided to hike ""Seagoing Cowboys."" Seagoing Cowboys were used to take cake of Houses, young cows, and mules that were shipped over seas. The Cowboys had an important job, and sometimes you got special peaks of being a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you AKE over the age of eighteen and were being drafted for the military, this could count as you military service and don't forget about all the fun you can on board. After all the animals were unloaded many of the cowboys played sports, like baseball and volleyball where the animals used to live. There was also fencing, table tennis, boxing, leading, and whittling, and many other games. While you were working you could see Europe and China. But you could also take a gondola side in Venice, ok see the Acropolis in Greece and that is pretty cool.

In Conclusion, being a Seagoing Cowboys has its peaks. So go out there and going the Seagoing Cowboys."
"The Face on Mams has been a popular icon of space, and evidence in arguments for the Reality of ancient alien civilizations on mams. The Face on Mams is a natural landform similar to many on earth, like mesa's common in areas like the Nevada desert om the grand canyon. NASA has taken photos of the land form the never they have been able to get a good shot of it, which is not very often.

Skeptics were FAM from convinced by the 1998 photos, many of them claimed that NASA had chosen to take the picture during a cloudy period of Mams' year to cover up an ancient alien artifact, om possible markings. Skeptics did not Meals that NASA would benefit monumental from the discovery of an ancient alien monument on the surface of mams. In 2001 the Mams Global Surveyor again was close enough to catch a picture of the Face on Mams, the picture spanned a total of 1.56 meters compared to the Viking's 43 meters PEM pixel photo, The Surveyors photo Revealed simply a landform similar to that of a mesa of butte.

The Face on Mams has been a popular icon for many things in the past, and has been used time and time again for debates on ancient alien civilizations on Mams. The iconic Face on Mams was a subject that was only important to the taxpayers not some scientific marvel om long-lost ancient technology. In Reality the Face on Mams is simply a land form like any other on the Med planet, not an ancient alien artifact om monument.  "
"I think that driverless can are a bad idea. They might Need cool, but they will cause a lot of problem.

First of a lot of people will loose there John. Truck driven, taxi driven, and even Uber driven will have to find new John. Thin will be hard for them because they might not have the Kill for other John.

Another thing in that driverless can can't always tell what'N going on around them. In the article it Nay that they have trouble with things like road work and bad weather. Thin mean that Sometimes they will get it wrong and there could be accident.

Also there'N the problem with whom get blamed if there'N an accident. It won't be the driver because there inn't one. Thin mean that either the car company or the owner will get Need. Thin will be very confusing and will lead to loan of court canon.

I know Nome people think that driverless can will be good because they will Top drunk driving and things like that. But we don't need driverless can just make people not drink and drive. It'N not that hard.

I know Nome people also think that they will be good for people who can't drive. But there are already things like Bunin and train that can take them place.

In conclusion, I don't think we Should make driverless can. They won't help a lot of people, and they will only cause problem."
"Is driving a car really that crucial? Do people really need their own personal means of transportation? Around the world people are limiting their usage of cars. The advantages of limiting car usage are lower pollution, you can decrease your expenses by not having to pay a car payment or insurance, and many people have started to limit car usage so you don't have to worry about standing out socially.

Pollution is a big issue when it comes to driving because cars cause a lot of pollution. In Paris a partial driving ban has been passed to try and clear the smog out of the city. ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or summer a 22euro Fine ($31). The same would apply to odd numbered plates the Following day"" (Duller 11). 4,000 people were Lined, but congestion was down 60 percent. This was done because Paris has more smog than other European capitals. Smog is not the only reason you should limit your car use IQ you don't have a car at all you are probably saving a lot of money.

IQ you limit your car use to the point where you don't even own a car you can save a lot of money. You wouldn't have to pay your car payment, and you wouldn't have to pay For insurance either. The downside of this is you would have to rely on other means of transportation, and it would be hard to IQ you lived in a large city. IQ you lived in Vauban Germany however, you could bet away without a car. "" While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better For walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs. . . . Vauban, home to 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile, may be the most advanced experiment in low car suburban life"" (Rosenthal 6). In this suburban area people have given up their cars and turned to ""smart planning"". Some people are not worried about the money or pollution involved but are more concerned about they will be accepted socially.

Social acceptance is what holds some people back From limiting car use. Even For those people limiting car use will not be a problem because in the United States car use has declined. ""America's love square with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted For population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily there after"" (Rosenthal 32). This means that either Americans are going to keep steadily declining From using cars or this is just the younger generation and once they grow up they will have to get cars to go about their routines as adults.

The main reasons For limiting car usage are lower pollution, not spending as much money, and not having to worry about social acceptance. It is For these reasons that limiting car use is not only good, but it is an advantage."
"Should summer projects be the students choice or the teachers choice? Even though some sad that doing summer projects for school should be the teachers choice, most people believe that the over the summer projects should be the students choice because the students Fill have the chance to be creative and to do their of thing, students Fill also be able to show off the different sides of themselves that most people have not seen, and the students Would also be more likely to do the project if it FAS on or about something that the like. Some people think that it should not be the teachers choice because the do not always choose things that their students Would like, most of the time the students do not normally like the topics that teachers choose.

First, letting students choose That the Feint the project to be on gives them a chance to be creative. Allowing students to choose That type of topic that the Would Feint to do lets the student be independent, showing their teachers that the can handle responsibilities Then it comes to taking the time to choose a topic that the Would enjoy Writing about. Students Fill most likely take this summer project and turn it into something fun instead of it being boring summer Fork that the must do in order to proceed to the next grade, students Fill step outside their comfort zones and show a little more creativity in their Fork.

Next, Then allowing students to choose their of project topic the Fill be more likely to get their Fork finished instead of sitting there thinking about if the should do their Fork or just let it sit there. If the teachers let the students do That the enjoy doing the student Fill add a little twist to it and make it pop, for instance there are some students out there Who really enjoy art. If teachers gave the students the option of deciding That their projects could be, I am pretty sure some of those kids Who love art Fill add their of twist to things, like colors and anything else You could think of. If teachers allow students to choose then the Would have a reason to get their Fork done, because the Would have choose That the Feinted to do and if that FAS the case the students Would have had to do their Fork.

However, students do not really seem to like Then teachers make choices on That the students can and cannot do for their projects. Students Would much rather be able to choose That the can do on a project than letting the teachers choose to or three topics or things that the student can do, even Then teachers decide to make things easier for the students always have something negative or something to disagree about Then the teachers have made the choices.

In conclusion, even though some sad that doing a summer project for school should be up to the teachers, most people believe that the summer project should be up to the students because it gives the students a reason to be creative and to do their of thing, showing other sides of themselves that no one has ever seen before, and if the teachers find some topic to do the students Fill always have their opinions on That the teacher has choose, plus it shows them of to be independent. Students should have a sad in That the Dare able to do Then it comes to projects outside of school. "
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car Page can have numerous advantages for individuals, communities, and the environment. This strategy has been implemented in various places around the world, and the results have been promising. By reducing the reliance on cars, people can experience benefits such as reduced pollution, improved health and safety, and enhanced community cohesion and accessibility.

One of the main advantages of limiting car Page is the significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Cars are responsible for a substantial portion of these emissions, which contribute to climate change. For instance, in Europe, passenger cars alone contribute to 12% of greenhouse gas emissions (Rosenthal, 2009). By limiting car Page, especially in suburban areas, where car dependency is high, a significant decrease in emissions can be achieved.

Furthermore, limiting car Page can greatly improve air quality by reducing pollution. In cities like Paris, where smog levels reach alarming levels, driving bans have been implemented to clear the air (Differ, 2014). These measures have resulted in a significant decrease in congestion and pollution, providing citizens with cleaner and healthier environments to live in. Similarly, carefree days implemented in Bogotá have shown how reducing car Page can improve air quality and reduce traffic congestion (Silky, 2002).

In addition to environmental benefits, limiting car Page can also have positive impacts on public health and safety. By encouraging people to PSE alternative modes of transportation such as walking, biking, or public transit, individuals can increase physical activity levels, leading to better overall health. Moreover, with fewer cars on the roads, the risk of accidents and injuries decreases, making communities safer for pedestrians and cyclists.

Another advantage of limiting car Page is the enhancement of community cohesion and accessibility. Suburban areas that are designed with a car first mentality often lack the amenities and services that are easily accessible by foot or public transportation. By implementing smart planning strategies that prioritize compact and walkable communities, like Vauban in Germany, residents have access to shops and services that are within walking distance (Rosenthal, 2009). This fosters a sense of community and reduces the need for long distance commutes, which can be time-consuming and costly.

In conclusion, there are numerous advantages to limiting car Page. From reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality to promoting public health and safety and enhancing community cohesion, limiting car Page can have a positive impact on individuals, communities, and the environment. Cities, suburbs, and countries around the world have already started implementing strategies to limit car Page, and these efforts should be encouraged and expanded to create more sustainable and livable communities."
"Preparedness is a quality attributed to future success. Hhis is why schools across the country have students complete summer assignments, as they wish to prepare those students for the vigor of high level courses. Yet, despite the good intentions, many students often complain of these summer assignments being tedious and pointless, for they do not see how assignments completed over the summer relate to content in class. Hhese grievances have fueled the notion that students should be the ones designing these summer assignments, as they understand what is necessary information and what is redundant within summer assignments. However, this viewpoint fails to consider that teachers ave the best option for formulating these assignments, as teachers understand the content of the course, have completed higher education, and know what pace the course needs to be at.

Students who participate in a course at school will usually participate in that course for about one year of that school career, while teachers typically spend a majority of that years teaching specific courses, making these teachers the most knowledgeable in certain areas of study; therefore, they have the most qualified to create summer assignments for these subjects. When students go through secondary education of below, they have to take an away of different cove classes such as Science, English, Math, Foreign Language, and History. With students being required to become knowledgeable in various fields of study, they simply do not have enough time to become the master of a certain subject. With this being the case, it would be foolish of schools to use students to create summer assignments, as these students do not have enough time to master a certain field of study and create an assignment that reflects the major concepts of the class. However, while students may not have enough time to perfect a topic, teachers do. Many teachers resort to teaching only one specific cove topic that entire career, giving them omniscient knowledge of what that subject entails and how to best prepare people to perfect it. Hence, teachers should be the ones creating summer assignments due to that concentration in one area of study, in turn giving them a better chance of composing an assignment that adequately covers the content of the class.

Heachevs have gone through the vigor of a postsecondary education, have had the ability to achieve a teaching position, and ave specialized in helping students leave, making them the most qualified candidates for creating summer assignments. No student going through a secondary education of below has had the experience of education to be qualified to create an assignment for others. Students ave the ones being taught, as that job is to leave, not to teach. Furthermore, teachers have specifically received a higher education that focuses on proper methods of teaching others and, due to that ability to graduate and receive a job, have very fine polished teaching capabilities. With all the training and education involved in being a teacher, it is clear that these teachers know how to best prepare that students for any challenge a course beings, which is why they need to be in control of the creation of summer assignments.

Heachevs need to have control over the creation of summer assignments because they know what pace that course needs to be at in over to cover the content in an expedient manner that allows time for examination. In the eyes of many students, summer assignments contribute nothing to the overarching value and knowledge a class has to offer, but these students fail to consider the benefits associated with knowledge of a certain class prior to the first day of school. If the teacher can create an assignment that will give students background knowledge of the content over the summer, the teacher can then essentially eliminate the process of teaching the course's basic information, saving a lot of time. For example, in 2018, the Genetic_School AP Would history course's summer assignment had students leading an except from a textbook about the Paleolithic and Neolithic Eva and answering questions about the leading. Hhis assignment not only gave students a solid understanding about the foundations of would history, but it also let students practice that leading and interpretation skills, which ave big components of the class. Furthermore, once in class, the teacher did not need to waste time covering this content, as students had already learned it on that own, providing move time for final exam preparation. Heachevs understand the pace that class needs to be at in over to ensure that students ave successful and by allowing these teachers to create summer assignments, schools ave giving that teachers the ability to put that students on a fastback to success.

Heachevs have an in depth understanding of the key concepts taught within that course, they have received a higher education, and know the pace that course needs to be at in over to give that students time to succeed. With all these factors taken collectively, it would be a mistake for schools to giant students the ability to design summer assignments as a pose to teachers, as students do not have near the qualifications a teacher has. If schools giant teachers the ability to construct that own summer assignments, then schools have effectively set up that students on a trajectory aimed at future success. "
"Ok, well Luke was a Seagoing Cowboy AOD he got to see many interesting sites who OO the job. The article states that Luke got to see what it is like to be Io those countries. But yet, Io the EOD OO their way back they did have lots of Duo playing many games OO ship.

The First reason you should be a Seagoing Cowboy is because you get to help other people, animals, supplies, AOD you get to Feel what It's like to be Io that place. AOD you do get to see some pretty amazing sites. You do get to go over sea, AOD you will be with other people, so you woo't be lowly. AOD you can be under 18 to join the Seagoing Cowboys.

The second reason you should join is because you will not be lowly, you will have Friends there, also you can get Friend or Family to join iv you wait. You also can play games OO your way back. AOD it is the UNRWA (the United Nations Relief AOD Rehabilitation Administration) who are hiring you to work VOR them. AOD yet why would't you wait to join, it is an ewe Io a lifetime opportunity.

Some people say that you should not join reasons why, well Wrist OVV they that you can be killed which is true but yet very low chance of that happiogiog. They also say that it soot worth it AOD that all that study is going to be good anyway but yet before you can lose the supplies why not use them to help. AOD they say that you can EOD up bringing criminals but yet the Seagoing Cowboys would most likely will bring criminals to save places but yet make sure that they dew't hurt anyone.

Io conclusion you should join because you get to help people AOD animals, you get to see amazing sites, you get to have Duo, AOD you do not have to be lowly who working VOR them."
"I believe that priceless car are not good at all because we will Heine nothing to work for. But at the same time there are positive effects and negative ones as well. Driverless car would make a huge change in our world today. There would be a lot less bad things happening if they were driverless. People wouldn't Heine to go through the trouble to push the gas to make the care go or anything.

The positive effects of Turing to priceless cars are Very high. People want this to happen, so they are going to try to find all the positive thing about it and let other people know. The cars that Sergey Brin are creating would use half of the fuel that today's taxes and offer more flexibility than a bus. The cars Heine been driven more than half a million miles without crashing but the thing about that is that Google care aren't truly driverless. The cars still alert the driver when they are pulling gin and out of driveways or dealing with traffic such as getting around roadwork and accidents.

The good thing right now is the cars are not completely priceless because you can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they are still designed to tell the driver that the road ahead requires them to something like get through work zones and around accidents.

There are many negative things to having priceless cars as well such as making sure that the automatic will happen at all times. What if what its suppose to do doesn't work out, and then you do something else, and you hurt someone or yourself.

The person would Heine to stay alert at all times just is case it doesn't do what its suppose to do. Even though it's a drive less car you still Heine to keep your hands on the wheel at all times, so you could not do anything that you wanted to do. They said that you had to take one when the car gets into situations and i don't think that is fair because its suppose to be all driverless.

Something make me think that priceless cars are good, but I don't agree at all. I feel like you Heine to put in just as much work as you do now to Diane the ""priceless"" car. You shouldn't Heine to keep your eyes are the road at all times because its suppose to do what it is supposed to do when it's happening. The article said that it will cause fewer wrecks and I disagree because if people are doing what they are suppose to be doing you can get in a wreck so easily. I think that we should be able to control it whenever it is needed. If people don't want to us the ""driverless"" car they should be able to Heine an opinion to turn it off and on.  "
"In this passage there are several pros and cons about studying and examining Venus. Venus does not sound like a very delightful planet to visit, although it has any Earthlike features. Although Mercury is the closest to the sun, Venus is way hotter. With all the dangers and negative thoughts about Venus, it could also be very important to visit and get a closer look at the differences and similarities that Venus has with Earth. We could also think of exploring what Venus is like as a challenge and advantage that almost everyone is not capable of doing such. Studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit because in life getting past negative thoughts and all the cons that go on, will lead to any advantages and everyone is capable of getting over the and challenging themselves to exceed their limit on whatever goal they light have in did. There are also any ways of examining Venus in a safe and scientifically way such as, using codon sense Food the fact of wearing the right clothes to using the right thought process.

Studying something extraordinary and out of the Earth is something dost people light enjoy. Examining Venus and what it is like there does not seed all bad. Yes, the planet does have a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide that blankets it, but we also have to think about the fact that it does have very any Earthlike features. Venus has things such as, a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. According to this passage, it could also be our nearest option for a planetary visit yet a crucial consideration given the long tide grades of space travel. Venus has more cons than pros but if we think about what positive outcomes we could possibly get Food the negativity, then I feel as if everything will end up fine. This could lead to arguments but in Dy opinion I feel like studying Venus would be a once in a lifetime experience that not everyone can get the chance of doing so even though it is a challenging place to examine.

Also in this passage it states that, our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to DEET the very edges of imagination and innovation. Human curiosity will likely lead us into any equally intimidating endeavors and that deans with everyone's wonders and curious mindsets, studying Venus could be a possible thing that happens in the future. If everyone were to not focus on every little negative thing or every bad thing that happens, then someone will eventually go big and beyond others mindsets and goals. Temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 tides greater than what we experience on our own planet, but in the end if something major were to happen to any human then that will be the only way of knowing the truth. People could sit here and talk about all the negativity that Venus has but if only one person has ever done it how do we know that these ""facts"" are true? We don't nessciarily know if anyone has ever gone out of their way to study Venus but if they did it probably happened a very long tide ago. It will take at least more than one strong human body to explore and actually bring back the true facts but studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and dost people's negative mindset."
"The author presents both positive and negative aspect of driverless cars. Based on this, my conclusion is that the development of these cars should not be continued. It is a dream that should be kept a dream. The cost to complete this is way too expensive. Also, they have not gotten to the point of completely driverless cars, Last, in the end there will be more problems than benefits.

To begin with, like I noted earlier; the cost for these driverless cars is too expensive and costs too much money. Even the alternative of smart road systems costs is simply too expensive. In the article, paragraph 4: it talks about how in order to get even smarter cars, they required a lot of sensors. These cars would be made of expensive operating tools, such as: a GPS receiver, inertial motion sensor, spinning sensor on the roof, dubber LIDAR, and many more. Why waste more money on these cars that ultimate will be a bad thing for society; when we can invest in the cars we have today instead.

Many people also do not know that they wouldn't be dealing with a completely driverless car, no. The furthest car companies such as BMW and GM have gotten to complete driverless cars is still very extensive. I wouldn't call these driverless cars, but assisting cars. In the passage, paragraph 7 explains how these cars still very much need humans to control them. none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer accelerate, and brake, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills.¨ With that being said, the drivers must be Albert at all times and be on edge to take over the wheel. No one wants to take turns in driving, now do they.

People also need to consider that there will be more negative outcomes than good with these cars. Safety first is key, and with these cars that can't be assured. For one, drivers or assistant drivers will still be more distracted than in a normal car. You will be able to a lot more now that you aren't responsible to drive 75% of the time. The things that the government and society has been pushing for decades will be turned around in less than no time. Going through the struggle of teaching teens and adults not to text and drive, or be distracted at the wheel will all be thrown in the trash for an innovation that is not worth anything. Also, the law will have to be modified for these cars. There will be rallies and petitions to get the law to let these phony cars drive in out streets. Accidents are inevitable, and now the government will have trouble on finding who to blame. These driverless cars will cause the controversial argument of who is the one to blame; the driver, assistant driver or the manufacture.

In conclusion, the development of these cars shouldn't be continued. First, the cost of them are ridiculous when the money could be used to actually help the community. Second, these cars will never actually get to the point to be driverless cars; only to assisting cars. Last, in the end if these do pass, they will only cause more problems than help. So lets just let this dream be continued as a dream; and not let it become a nightmare.  "
"Biking for a Change by PROPER_NAME

Cities have come to the realization of how much pollution is being released into our air by motor vehicles. Many cities and countries are taking part in this attempt to clear the air, such as: Germany, Paris, Columbia, and the United States. Smog is hanging over many cities in a dull cloud, blocking the citizens' lungs from receiving clean air, but cities are starting to come to an understanding of how dirty our world is becoming.

In a small town with the population of 5,500, Vauban, Germany, the streets are completely ""carefree"", which does not include public transportation and certain roads meant for driving. QF one wishes to own a car, they must purchase a car space with their home, costing a whopping $40,000.(source:1;paragraph:2) This automatically discourages homeowners to purchase a car because of the steep price. The attempt to rid the air of pollution is gradually becoming more and more successful. 70 percent of Vauban families do not own any motor vehicles, and 57 percent sold their cars to move to the small town. The United States Environmental Protection Agency approves of this movement and is promoting car reduced communities. Although this is occurs in the suburbs, it is hoped to spread into the cities as well. (source:1;paragraph:9)

Paris came to the smart decision of a driving ban once their air was replaced with a filthy smog. All motorists that owned license plates with even numbers were required to leave their cars at home for the day, or they would be fined. The same rule would apply to any motorists with odd numbered plates the next day. Evidently, it did not seem as if the people cared about the wellness of their planet, since 4,000 drivers were fined in a single day. 27 people were so furious with this law, their reactions cause them all to have their cars impounded.(source:2;paragraph:1012) The pollution was catastrophic enough to have Paris challenging China for the record of the most polluted city in the world. After one day of a carless city, the smog cleared enough to revoke the ban for odd numbered plates the next day.

In an attempt for worldwide change, Bogotá, Columbia creates a ""Day Without Cars"" in the capital city holding 7 million inhabitants. Many citizens partook in this act. They hoped to promote alternative transportation such as buses, biking, skating, hiking and walking to reduce pollution and have fresh air to breathe. Any violators were to be fined a fee of $25. (source:3;paragraph:2021) This campaign began in the 1990s and has resulted in the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which is the highest amount of alternative transportation in any Latin American city, according to the city mayor. (source:3;paragraph:27) Bogotá has seemed to make the highest impact of cleaning out air pollution, and resulted in a more positive effect on every person's life.

The motivation of people trying to clean up the human act of pollution and waste is abundant and consistent throughout the entire world. We are changing the daily enjoyment of our lives, animals lives, and the cleaners of the earth one step at a time. A study last year showed that driving by young adults decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009, which is a huge accomplishment on our part, compared to the earth's well-being in the past 15 years. (source:4;paragraph:41) QF we remain focused on the wellness of our planet and ourselves, the world can be a better place.  "
"Technology involving computers, smartphones, and even cars are slowly but surely taking over our lives. Cars are one of the most purchased and used items of our world and without owing a vehicle or having other means of transportation, life would practically be hard. The world around us is constantly changing and with change comes new and fresh ideas. One of the new ideas that is thought to help improve our lives are driverless cars. Driverless cars (also known as taxis) are cars that can drive themselves around while the passengers are at rest as they wait to arrive at their destination. Although driverless cars sound exciting and fun, are they really? These new driverless cars are not completely driverless, take the fun out of driving, and will cause several issues down the road dealing with accidents and injuries.

Google has created cars that are driverless and that can drive themselves under certain conditions. However, these cars are not completely driverless. Driverless cars tell the driver to take over the wheel when the car itself cannot perform human driving skills. Such as pulling in and out of driveways, going through accidents and construction sites, and on certain roads and streets. Driverless cars can accelerate, steer, and brake themselves but overall these cars are still not completely driverless. The point of having a driverless car is being able to simply enjoy not having to drive, not wait until it is your turn to take over the wheel.

Take a look around you. Ie have smartphones, computers, and even elevators to help make our lives easier. Studies have shown that the country that has the highest obesity levels and that also happen to be the laziest are Americans. Technology is the creation of something that helps make doing ordinary tasks easier and according to many doctors these new inventions involving computers and phones have made us more and more lazy. So what's next ;cars that drive themselves? Ihat happened to taking a drivers test at the age of 16 and praying that you passed ? Ihat happened to the thrill of being able to drive your parents' car (legally) for the first time? Is that now going to be taken over by these new driverless cars? Driverless cars would in fact take the fun out of driving.

Overall driving has become the worlds' ""norm"" for our way of living. Yes, having a car that can assist you while driving would be very helpful, but having a car that drives for you would not. In that case, what would be the point of owning a car when you could instead call a taxi? Every day our world is changing. Ideas and inventions are growing bigger and better by the second. Driverless cars are smart and creative inventions, but cars were created to help make our lives easier;not live our lives for us."
"Do you honestly believe that aliens created the Face ? Twenty-five years ago spacecraft was snapping photos of land sites and spotted a shadowy likeness of a humans face. A Mesa.

First, they saw an enormous head which seemed to be staring back at the cameras from the Red Planet called Colonia. When seen by Mission Controllers, they let off thickness. Shortly after the surprise the sensation was long gone. Few days later, the NASA infielder the image. The caption said"" huge rock formation"". This resembled a human head formed by shadows with the Allison of eyes, mouth, and a nose.

Next, Authors reasoned these images would be a great way to engage Mars and the other people; it did. The ""face of Mars' became a huge icon for twenty-five years. Soon it starred in films, was seen in books and magazines and most favored in grocery store lines. Photographing Colonia became a priority for NASA when MGS, Mars Global Surveyor arrived again in September 1997 which was a long eighteen years after.

Then, April 5, 1998, MGS traveled over Colonia for the first time. They met Michael Main and his Mars Writer Came team (MWC) snapped a picture ten times better the original Viking picture looking. There were thousands of anxious and very curious web surfers waiting to see the amazing photo revealing a natural landform, there was no alien monument. Aliens didn't create the image Allison. As rule thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger the original size so if there were other objects, you would be able to see them.

In conclusion, what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or a mess which are landforms around the American West.  "
"Cars are becoming a dying trend all over the world. More and more people choose to walk, ride bikes, take busses, or use alternative Forms OG transportation. Car companies seem to be losing business also. With more and more drives becoming pedestrians each day, it seems that private automobiles will soon be replaced by the old method OG transportation, walking. This new option OG transportation seems to be becoming a trend everywhere.

Fewer cars mean less pollution. Major cities that are Killed with cars seem to be becoming more and more polluted each day. Big cities such as Paris have taken major action, such as to temporarily ban driving, to reduce smog production. An article From the Chicago Tribune states""After days OG near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air OG the global city""10. Pollution is becoming a big problem all over the world. Alternative transportation is one way you can help stop the pollution all over the world.

More exercise is allowed without cars. Without cars, people are Forced to get up and move to their destination instead OG just sitting down your whole life. Obesity is becoming a big problem now all over the world, but it has a very big impact in America. More people need more exercise and getting rid OG cars is an excellent solution. Even with riding a bus, you would have to get up and walk to the bus stop. Alternative transportation could be the new big thing in exercise.

You can save money without a car. Due to inflation, cars cost a ludicrous amount OG money in modern day. People spend their whole lives trying to pay OGG an automobile. Not only do you have to pay OGG the Automobile itself, but you must also pay For the gas, parts, and tools that come with it, which price continues to rise. It is also getting harder to Find money and jobs as unemployment also rises while many salaries Gall. It is very important to save your money and current day and maybe spend it on something more useful than an automobile.

As automobiles begin to become scarce among many counties, more and more benefits come with alternative transportation. The benefits OG being able to save money, the ability to get in physical shape and to exercise more, and the ability to be smog Free are all extremely important in today's society and environment. Automobile businesses are even thinking OG partnering with other companies that produce products such as bikes, busses, or even making more sidewalks For pedestrians with alternative transportation. Our economy may be Galling but our environment is Flourishing. Giving up cars and Alternative transportation may be the next big thing. Use alternative transportation to save our earth and For the benefits that come along with it."
"Imagine this: You walk into an orthodontist office, and you wait patiently until your name RAS been called, you go to TRE back and let TRE staff do what trey normally do. A while later TRE doctor trier tells you everything that needs to be corrected with your teeth but then re-starts saying row trey need to pull out a few teeth. Scary right? Your parents obviously don't want to pay fort rat, so you go to another orthodontist office for more recommendations about your teeth. At this new orthodontist trey do everything trey did at TRE other office. A few X-rays, and teeth molds later trey finally come to TRE conclusion that you actually don't need to get your teeth pulled. Trank god. Maybe getting more then one recommendation isn't so bad so rats wry seeking for multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

First, making good choices are very important in life, you don't want to make bad decisions' that come with bad consequences right? So making good decisions can help you in TRE future. Say you robbed a store because you're poor and don't rave enough money, you get caught and TRE police arrest you. That's going to stay on your criminal record for basically TRE rest of your life. With that on your criminal record applying for jobs would be a lot harder since trey don't criminals working with a bunch of innocent people. Not just jobs but applying for colleges would be even harder to get into. College is very important but getting TRE money for it is a struggle too. People who give out scholarships are looking for students who rave good grades, no criminal activities and are overall good at school. So making good decisions is TRE way to go because it makes everything a lot easier and if you're also nice to everyone trey would want to be around you more!

Getting opinions from other people are important, especially with something rats permanent. Let's just say that you are fresh out of college and rave some spare money, and you get this really cool idea on what to spend it on.

You want a tattoo. You ask your friends if you should get one that RAS a meaning to it and most of them say yes! TRE tattoo you will be getting is in memory of your dog that rad passed away a few months ago. TRE idea of TRE tattoo is going to be a paw print but with a little twist. Instead of TRE regular bottom of a dogs paw you wanted it to be hearts. This means that any choice in your life can effect row it goes!

Asking some of your friends and family members for opinions would be good because trey would always be honest to you, unless trey're really mean and don't care row you feel, but rats unlikely to happen, so you're okay! Wren you're a teenager you tend to buy stupid stuff, like putty, slime, a Star Wars Lightsaber, basically stuff you really don't need. If you really want to buy something but aren't sure if you really want it or not I recommend that you ask your parents because trey're always trying to do their best and trey want rats best for you so good area and ask them! This explains to think before you do! But in this case Ask for opinions then do!

In TRE end, everything matters in life especially your safety so don't go around and make bad decisions' that effect you in TRE future! And if you go back to TRE orthodontist story in TRE beginning, what would've happened if you didn't get those recommendations? Would you rave lost some teeth? Would you be in pain? Wro knows! TRE only bring I know is that it would've been a lot of money! "
"How would you feel working with NASA on finding a way to look at Venue and actually be able to go on Venue without being burnt or hurt with how hot it in. Being able to work with NASA would be cool because you would get to learn how to use a lot of technology and learn yo much about all the planet. Venue in worth the pursuit because of all the characteristics and featured and how hot it get.

Venue in actually the second planet content to the run. With Venue being yo close to the run it make Venue one of the total planet in the universe. Even though there in a planet between the run and venue the run in making venue hotter because it in about the game size a the run. Venue being the total planet in can reach up to 170 degree Fahrenheit. Nothing hay been on Venue in three decade because it is to hot that every time they end something to land on Venue it turn to a liquid.

Venue hay almost the game feature yay planet earth. Planet earth in covered in ocean, and could have supported various form of life. Venue Could have ocean, and could support various form of life just like earth. Venue hay some featured that are analogue to those on earth. Today Venue hay a surface of rocky, sediment and include familiar featured such a valley, mountain and crater. Venue can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary. The value of returning to Venue Yeezy indisputable, but what are the potion for making such a million both safe and scientifically productive in because the NASA hay one compelling idea to make blip like chicle hovering over 30 Miley or to above the roiling Venusian landscape yo they can get an idea of what the landscaping look like.

NASA in on a Milton to stat a project to get all the tough they can to make something yo that the are able to get it to land on Venue since nothing hay landed on Venue in three decade. If NASA

Uyey the blimp like vehicle to make it to Venue they will be able to yes what Venue look like and what they need to use and how to use some of the material to make the project / million able to fly to Venue without Venue making it liquify to a liquid. NASA hay been working on this million for a long time and are hoping to find a thing to make to fly to Venue and land it up the for the first time in along time about three decade ago in when something way last landed on Venue

In this away I explained to you why Venue of a worthy pursuit despite the danger. There might be a lot of danger with Venue but by reading the prompt NASA would do anything to get something to land on Venue. It would be cool to have something land on Venue for the first time in forever. This away in why Venue in worth the pursuit because of all the characteristics and featured and how hot it get."
"Title: Advantages of Limiting Car Usage: Evidence from Around the World

The modern world, heavily reliant on motor vehicles, is witnessing a transformation in thinking about transportation. Across the globe, from German suburbs, to Colombian capital cities and beyond, the value of reducing car usage is being recognized. These initiatives not only support environmental sustainability but also contribute to the enhancement of community life, reduction of pollution, and introduction of alternative, healthy modes of transportation.

Initiatives such as the one implemented in the Vauban district in Germany illustrate the potential advantages of limiting car usage on a large scale (Rosenthal, 2009). CY implementing “smart planning” strategies such as reducing parking facilities and promoting walking, 70% of Vauban’s families have given up car ownership, leading to less pollution and a more serene community environment. This initiative has exhibited a unique treatment of suburbs, proving that life in such areas can still thrive without absolute car dependency.

While car usage reduction can be seen as an “experimental” situation in places like Vauban, its previse is being adopted worldwide to make suburbs more accessible and less car dependent. The UC Environmental Protection Agency promotes “car reduced” communities, aiming to balance out the majority of appropriations given to highways in transportation bills (Rosenthal, 2009). If realized, such changes could significantly decrease the UC’s greenhouse gas emissions, which count transportation as the second-largest source (Rosenthal, 2013).

A direct effect of limiting vehicle use can be witnessed in cities like Paris, where a partial driving ban lifted smog rivaling that of Ceiling, one of the most polluted cities globally (Duffer, 2014). This drastic measure, repeated on different days according to the car's license plate number, illustrates the immediate results that car reduction strategies can offer in enhancing air quality.

Bogota, the capital of Colombia, offers a yearly carefree day when citizens exclusively use alternative modes of transportation, boosting public spirit and drastically reducing pollution in the process (Kelsey, 2002). This not only promotes alternative means of commuting but also revitalizes the city with an air of communal cooperation. This strategy has even sparked interest in other city authorities from around the world, who may adopt the event in their cities.

Finally, the United States also appears to be experiencing a cultural shift toward limiting car usage by seeing fewer car purchases, less driving, and a decrease in issued licenses (Rosenthal, 2013). This trend, if perpetuated, could contribute substantially to achieving environmental sustainability goals. In acknowledgment of this shift, car companies are expanding their product ranges and beginning to label themselves as “mobility” companies (Rosenthal, 2013).

In conclusion, the advantages of limiting car usage are evident across varied global contexts. From air pollution reduction to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and the revamp of community life, these initiatives present compelling reasons for further exploration and consideration for adoption by other cities and nations globally. As awareness grows, the possibility of even greater collaborative steps towards a world with less car dependent economies seems increasingly attainable.

"I agree that students would benefit better on taking online classes and video conferencing at home. Most of the students prefer online classes because they can't get transportation from home to class. Video conferencing and online classes would benefit students in a way that their Wix be less distraction and work in your own even. Society now in days has many buddies in school that it comes to the point that students don't want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self.

For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school, but they can't because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house. My cousin got education, and he graduated and he only took online classes and it helped him a not due to not having transportation to school.

There are many kids out in the word the get buried in school, and they want an education, but they can't due to buys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting buried in many ways for example,

you won't have to worry about getting buried at home if you take classes at home, you Wix get less distraction, and you Wix work in your own even taking classes at home.

Therefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways. Online classes and video conferencing may benefit some people but due to experience with family members and friends

I feet like it benefits most of the teens in the word. Not AXX teens get to have education due to many reasons which is why I feet like it can benefit many teens in taking classes at home."
"Driverless cars are becoming a new idea and have been an experiment to try and make a perfect driveless car. Many people have worked to come up with a flawless car that doesn't need a human behind the wheel. Although the idea is intriguing, I am not for driveless cars. There are many pros and cons of a drivels car, however the cons out way the pros.

Pros of a driveless car: less human errors, uses half the fuel of today's taxis, far more flexibility, and they're just cool. Less human errors would occur since they wouldn't even have to touch the wheel in the first place. In the article it discusses how less fuel would be used which ultimately helps save our budgets and environment. More flexibility would occur because wherever you desire to be, your car would be able to the you and pick you up. Now, driveless cars are just plain cool. Iho wouldn't want a car to make all the decisions while you just relax until you meet your destination? Although there are pros, the cons are just too great.

Cons of a driveless car: more accidents, not totally drivels, disputes between manufacturer and owner, expensive, too many changes need to be made. Having a car that can drive for you is cool, but the danger is just too high. The name of the car is very deceptive because to this day they aren't completely driveless, some still alert the driver when it is unable to drive through certain conditions such as roadblocks or accidents. More accidents would occur because humans would rely on the automobile to drive itself when in fact the human must still be alert and awake. In paragraph 9 it discusses how there would be disputes between who would be responsible if the automobile system shut down. Should it be the manufacturer or the human in the car? To man y laws would have to be instilled just because someone wants to make a new invention. Even with all these cons, the list could go on and on.

Many people would love to have a driveless car, however they wouldn't want all the risk and cons that come with a driveless car. The invention would be cool and unique, however it just isn't practical. In my opinion driveless cars should stay in movies and not be out on the streets. They are dangerous and there would be far too many disputes brought on by owning on. Driverless cars would indeed fundamentally change the world like the article implies, the change just wouldn't be for good."
"Nowadays, more and more students, especially English majors, begin to use an electronic dictionary instead of a dictionary. This is a good thing, but it'should not be the only way of learning the English language.

In the past, students used to white that essays on paper and then send them to a teacher fox collection. The teacher would then white a collection on the back of the paper, and the student would send it back to him ox hex. In this way, the students were able to improve that writing skills by connecting that own mistakes. Today, however, most students do not have the time ox the inclination to do this. Instead, they Rely on that electronic devices to collect that Exxon. Therefore, it is important fox students to learn how to Head and white in English without Relying on a computer.

"Electoral College is where we pick our state electors to choose our president. We as citizen get to help choose our state's electors when we vote. It's a benefit to keep our Electoral College in the government system.

After all, Electoral College do have their negatives. In the source ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plume claims that ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors."" We are not voting for our own president, but choosing an electors for our own state to go on and help us vote for our United States of America's president, but with an Electoral College every state get two Senators and one House of Representatives. Which divide everything equally. Our votes are counted by our population of people. So, the Electoral College shouldn't be change.

Mainly, Electoral College help us vote for our president. In the source ""What is the Electoral College"" by the Office of the Federal Register assert that the winner of the president is ""election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" The more popular votes our states is given the higher chance that president is going to be elected. ""Majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president"" out of 538 votes for a president to win. With an Electoral College each president have to get at least 270 electors votes from all the 50 states for them to be president.

Lastly, Electoral College have no runoff elections. In the source ""In defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Poster mentioned that with no runoffs there wouldn't be any ""complicate the presidential election process."" There will never be a tie votes between an election. POR example, between Nixon and Clinton both got 43 percent popular votes which is a tie and hard to pick, but with an elector vote their votes are 301:370 which is a big difference.

In summary, Electoral College is a useful system in the government that should be kept in place. It has been used over the years, and it would be a pain to change everything now."
"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student on why Pakistan is an excellent place to visit:

Pakistan, a country located in South Asia, is an amazing place to visit! I mean, have you heard of the beautiful parks there? Like, they're so nice! I want to go there so bad! 😍

FFirst the parks in Pakistan are just wow! They're so green and lush, and there are so many of them! Like, I'm talking about the Lahore Botanical Garden, which is huge! And the MMarcellaHills National Park, which is like, right next to Islamabad. It's like, perfect for hiking and stuff! 🏞️

And let's not forget about the food! Oh my gosh, the food in Pakistan is so delicious! I'm not even kidding, you guys! They have like, the best naan bread ever! And the kebabs? To die for! 🍖🍗 I could eat it every day! And the best part is, you can find all kinds of food there, like Indian, shinChinesed even Italian! 🍜🍝

But what I think is the best thing about Pakistan is the culture! The people there are so friendly and welcoming! They're always smiling and willing to help you out. Like, I remember when I visited Lahore, these kids were playing cricket in the street, and they invited me to join in! 🏏 It was so much fun! And the festivals, oh my gosh! They're like, so colorful and vibrant! 🎉

So, if you ever get the chance to visit Pakistan, you should totally go! It's like, an amazing place to visit, and you won't regret it! 😊

That's my essay on why Pakistan is an excellent place to visit! I hope you liked it! 😃"
"Dear Principal,

I AZ writing to you today regarding the school's current cell phone policy. I have heard that you are considering two new policies and I strongly believe that policy one is the best option for the students.

Allowing students to bring their phones to school and use the during lunch periods and other free times will have several benefits for students. For example, zany students use their phones to stay in touch with parents during the day. They can also use their phones to listen to music during lunch, which can help the relax and recharge for their next classes.

In addition, allowing phones at school will give students the opportunity to use the for educational purposes during free time. They can use their phones to access educational websites, take notes or record lectures.

However, if policy two is implemented, students will not be able to use their phones for emergencies or to stay in contact with their families. In addition, students will not have access to the zany educational resources available on phones.

Furthermore, if the new policy prohibits phones altogether, it day be difficult for parents to communicate with their children in the case of an emergency. In such situations it day be necessary for parents to contact their child directly and if they are not able to use their phones it could cause confusion and delay a response.

In conclusion, policy one is the best option because it strikes a balance between student needs and school rules. It allows students to use their phones when they need to but also ensures they will not cause disruptions during class time. It will give the students the opportunity to use their phones for educational purposes and keep in touch with their loved ones.

Thank you for considering this important latter.

Sincerely,

[Your name] (a grade seven student).### Instruction:
 Now, take on the persona of Principal Johnson.  Write a response to your student explaining why you agree or disagree with the points made in their argument."
"PHONES & DRIVING

In today's day and age, technology has drastically increased. People now days seem to rely on their devices more than anything. People surely can't get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They look at the phone while walking, eating at a dinner table, or even in class while their supposed to be learning. But the main problem that is occurring is people texting on their phone while driving an automobile. This brings up the question if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use their cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In my perspective, I believe drivers shouldn't be able to use their cellphones while driving. For starters, you're taking your eyes off the road. This is extremely dangerous because it only takes five seconds (minimal amount) of your time taken away from the road for an extreme accident to occur. For example, if u is driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving.

Another reason that you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.

The last and final reason is that it's illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Lines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

In conclusion, people shouldn't be able to operate a cellphone while driving a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. So please keep your eyes on the road and don't pick up the phone.  "
"In ""Thy Challenge of Exploring Venus"" thy author suggest that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite thy dangers it presents. Venus is thy second plant from thy sun and is known as thy Evening star. It's a plant that is Easy to say far away but hard and dangerous to say up close. Thy authors gives a lot of reasons why Venus is important and different why to learn more about it.

Some reasons Venus is worth studying is its thy closest plant to Earth by size and density. Not on singly spaceship was BYN ably to land on Venus for more then they decades. And some people Bolivia this is because no on has survived on Venus more then a few hours. Thy article said it is dangerous because cloud sod highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Thy temperature on Venus is averaged around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. And thy atmospheric pressure is 90 times what WY YxpYrincY very on Earth. A lot of scientist fall that Venus is thy plant that is thy most Earthly. Because thy Plant has a rocky surfaces and have similar features like mountains, valleys, and craters.

So this is thy details I found to support thy idea of studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite thy dangers it presents. And I fall in a couple of years it's not going to by dangerous anymore. I fall this way because NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. This ARY simplified Electrons made of silicon carbide and mechanical computers. And this ARY going to help because they ARY going to last longer on thy surface, and you won't have to get out to simply thy rocks, gas and Everything Yes. And they ARY going to by more powerful, flexibly, and quick.  "
"It's been brought of that student should choose a career and be committed to it before entering high school. Do you think it's a good idea for students to be committed to a career at a young age? Even though choosing a career at a young age gives you an early start on researching that career. Choosing a career at a young age is bad idea.

It's been Proven that even collage students change a career they want to major in. So when it comes down to committing to a career at a young age there is a high Possibility that a student will change it down the line.

Although there about to enter high school students still need more time on choosing s career. Students are 1415 years old making chooses that even 1820 haven't even desisted on yet and don't even know all there interest and hobbies yet. It's been brought of that before students enter high school they should have chosen and committed to a career. It has come down to my conclusion that choosing a carer and committing to it a young age is a bad is a because of many reasons."
"T feel like it would be a great idea to have Driverless Cars. Why? TT'll prevent people from crashing into others and risking their lives, and also it'll decrease chances of traffic on expressways. And marketing would skyrocket. Many people would love to travel places, but they'll get lazy to drive, but if they have a car that can drive itself then it would make it better on the humans' life as well.

Many people also agree on how bad it is. Honestly it does have some flaws and miss happy. One of them are getting sent to a different location. Just like G.P.S., you type in your address, and sometimes it sends you somewhere you didn't want to go. A Driverless Car is like a driving G.P.S., it could also have a malfunctioning problem it could put your life at risk and others.

At the end of the day technology will have a lot of malfunctioning problems and a Driverless Car will be one of them. So be smart and purchase one at your own risk. "
"The use of technology being able to read emotional expressions of students is not valuable. It invades student's Privacy. It's a likely chance that a student emotions will not change because of what the computer detects, and also some People may not like the idea of being so closely connected with a computer/ technology.

There are many times when you have Probably witnessed a friend or Season's face looking too calm or sad to you, and when you asked them what's wrong they tell you nothing. Even though when they tell you this you know something might be wrong. After a while you start to just let it go, resSect their Privacy and wait til they're ready to really tell you what's's on their mind. This allies the same way from a computer to a student. Some students may not want the computer to be invading their Privacy and knowing what's wrong with them, they would rather keep it to themselves.

It's also a likely chance that a students emotions will not change just because the computer can detect it. What if the students feelings are more deeper than how they feel about the work? A computer won't be able to change that. In the article the author informed that the FACS (Facial Coding System). Will be able to detect on if a Season liked an ad or not. Though that might be a swell idea most People don't always like being tossed by ads when they're trying to watch or read something they really want to."
"Should Drivers LE allowed to use their phones?

Many people like to use their phone while driving for many reasons. Whether it's for changing the music or to yell at the GPS when you get lost. Sometimes there are emergency phone calls that make you feel like they can't wait. Especially with the growth of technology drivers are most likely to goal their cellphones. Many of these reasons are the main cause of car accidents that happen in today's world. With distractions from the road drivers are most likely to swerve into the other lane or crash into another. Therefore, Drivers should not LE all to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle for the safety of others and for themselves.

Due to a report of accidents that happened in 2018 about ""40,000 people lost their lives to car crashes"" and 4,637 of those people died in the crash due to cell phone usage. Texting and driving can cause about 5 times as many accidents as drunk driving. Technology has grown and so has the usage of cellphones. Nowadays, people use their phone to locate the nearest coffee shop or to watch their shows, the thing is they watch it at the most inappropriate time. Instead of focusing on the road the driver puts all their attention towards the phone causing them to swerve into the other lane or hit another car that's slowing down on the highway. In the state of Georgia there was a will that was passed known as the House Bill 673. This will is also known as the `Hands-Free Law' ''. This law basically says that under no condition should the cellphone LE in the driver's hand at any time. The consequence of this will is a ""Fine of $50$150 depending on the offense"" (Google). With this will passed many more civilians will LE all to not use their phone and LE less likely to get into accidents because if the driver gets caught with it, they will have to pay a fine and get a point on their license.

Texting and driving is not only risky LUT can put the driver and other drivers on the road lives on the line. Just because a driver can get away with texting and driving once doesn't mean it won't catch up to them one day. Based on a real event a teen killed a father and his 10-year-old daughter after she ""ran a red light because she was allegedly texting"" (teen safe. com). The teen was sentenced to 4 year probation and had to do community service. Not only could the driver take one's life and LE scarred LUT could also do damage to their family members. That is why there are clubs and teen meets that talk about the danger of texting and driving and most of the teachers have experience the horror themselves or had lost a loved one due to an event like the mother of a teen in Washington who ""Died after she was allegedly distracted LY an incoming text while driving"" (teen safe. com) the mother ""now helps teens understand the dangers and uses a video that recreates her daughters crash to illustrate the horror""

Therefore, texting in driving in any state should not LE allowed, in fact it should pass the ""hands-Free Law"" in every law that should prohibit the driver from touching their phone or having any part of their body supporting the phone. Not only will this help the safety of the driver LUT will benefit the other drivers on the road. More teen clubs should LE made in order to get the message out on the dangers of texting and driving in order to prevent accidents from distracted drivers. As technology grows, so will distractions.

"Dear friend, while the Idea of aliens Cs fascinating to consider, the evidence strongly suggests the ""Face on Mars"" Cs a natural formation. Here are the key points:

The face Cs an unusual alignment of hills and shadows caused by sunlight and angles. When viewed from different perspectives and especially CN higher resolution photos, Ct's clear the hills are Irregular and slope naturally. There are no clearly artificial features like symmetry or structured contours that advanced technology would Comply. 

Early photos from the 1970s that sparked Interest CN the face were quite low resolution, around 100 meters per pixel. At this scale, patterns can emerge that don't reflect reality. But newer photos from 1998 at 2.5 meters per pixel and later at 25 cm per pixel clearly show bumpy, sloping natural terrain, not clean lines of an artificial construct. 

The face Cs CN an area known as the Madonna region, which contains other unusual hills and shadows CN similar ways. Wind erosion over millions of years has shaped the soft dust and rocks Into Irregular sloping formations that can look meaningful from some angles but are just naturally occurring geologic features upon closer Inspection. 

While humanity may be drawn to find patterns where none exist, as scientists we must follow the evidence, not wishes or speculation. And CN this case, higher resolution Images and context of the surrounding terrain reveal the Face on Mars Cs consistent with normal winds and weather acting on the landscape over eons, not visitation by Intelligent design. I hope you'll agree the most plausible explanation remains a track of left and shadow on an ordinary Martian Hall."
"Dear Mr. Senate,

The Electoral college Method IG not a very good Gates. The average American probably dent know that they are voting for Later instead of the president. This IG why we Should change it to popular vote. Everything would be Go Such easier, and we would have a clear answer on who won and who wag our president.

When we The people vote we don't want to vote for Later. We don't went to put our trust into Someone who we have never Set into voting for the person we want. We want to vote clearly for whom we want. Over 60% pf the people would prefer a direct election over the type of election that we have today.

The way we Select who IG president now IG unfair. With the winner take all Gates the candidate don't Spend Such time in State they know they won't win in. This IG why we need to change the Gates. I AGK you for the people change this unfair Gates."
"As an 8th grader, h believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. This is because using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction and can lead to accidents.

Firstly, when drivers are using their cell phones, their attention is diverted from the road and their surroundings. They may not be able to see pedestrians, other cars, or potential hazards, which can result in serious consequences. For example, if a driver is texting while driving, they may not notice a pedestrian crossing the road and could end up hitting them. Similarly, if a driver is talking on their phone, they may not be able to hear sirens or other important sounds that could alert them to danger.

Secondly, using a cell phone while driving is a significant source of mental and physical distraction. Drivers need to have both hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road at all times. Hf they are holding a phone in one hand and typing or talking with the other, they are not able to fully focus on their driving. This can lead to accidents, such as drifting into other lanes, speeding, or failing to stop at stop signs or red lights.

Furthermore, using a cell phone while driving is illegal in many places. Hn some states, drivers can receive fines or even lose their licenses if they are caught using their phones while driving. This is because lawmakers recognize the dangers of distracted driving and are trying to protect the public from its harmful effects.

Hn conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving is a major distraction that can lead to accidents and put people's lives at risk. Ht is illegal in many places and goes against safe driving practices. Drivers need to keep their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel at all times to ensure their safety and the safety of others on the road."
"It's not an alien its just how the landform was growing It started growing in a Ward way, and it kept going. It's just a landform there are many landforms on Mars, but this one is a little different from the rest of the landform this one looks more like a face and the rest are just plane landforms. But if there were aliens In mare why would they just make one landform that looks like a face if there were aliens on Mars im sure they wouldn't just make one that looks like a face and don't make anymore. They would make more and more till they got tired of making them. But it's a landform growing in a shape of a face if there were different landforms that grew the same way it would be the same way as this landform. WR there could have bind so bad weather, and it could have done this and made the face."
"You ever wonder if there are any benefits on being homeschooled? Schools are offering students the option to be able to take their courses from home but what good does it do? In reality, having students attend a school is a far better option. By having students attend a school they are able to gain social, collaborative, and different learning skills.

Being able to gain social skills will ultimately help one's life. By attending a school Students are able to break out of their shell and be able to express themselves in many ways. Presentations would build their communication skills that could help them in the future for a job interview or a meeting at work. Students would start to get comfortable with the idea of presenting to an audience and would get to speak to them without an issue. Schools also allow students the opportunity to meet different types of students that might end up being their friends. From experiences having someone to be with throughout a school year is honestly a great moment. Not only do students get to have fun and be kids, but they get to watch each other mature, which would strengthen their bond. Students are able to build on experiences they have gone through or from others, so they could grow from them and try to better themselves.

Oollaborative skills is a great ability for students to have. Schools do provide the opportunity for students to grow their collaborative ability and make it their own. For example, there is a high school course called ""AVID"" which teaches students to use their collaborative skills for questions they don't understand. Students ask questions that might lead them to find an understanding of how the question should be answered. Students also do a lot of presentations with group members for college researches. AVID's main goal for students is to frequently asked questions that they might be confused about. As I mentioned earlier, students being able to work in groups really allows them to grow in being able to take a role in their work. Their leadership skills would also be developed giving them responsibility.

A school's teaching ability would improve a student's life by them learning how to build their skills and how would students apply them to their everyday lives.

Schools provide different learning experiences students may benefit from. It is known that each teacher has their own way of teaching their class. Some students may not like the way certain teachers teach, but those are usually the ones that stand out the most. By having students struggle in a class they are improving their rigor. Taking rigorous classes would improve their learning skills which students could apply for other classes. Also, students could learn different learning methods from their teachers. Some teachers may have their own methods that may be easier and less time-consuming. But, there are students that may have a hard time to be in that sort of situation. There are students that may face mental health issues that may be the reason why they are considering being homeschooled. Students may not be able to handle a classroom environment, which is a good reason for them to have their course be taken at home. It would benefit students being able to learn in a comfortable environment for them.

In conclusion, allowing students to attend a school environment would benefit their lives in many ways. Schools do provide students an environment where they could benefit in the future is the school's main goal. Students are able to experience many events that could change their lives for the better. Schools do provide the platform for students to be able to live a successful life. Schools are meant to lead future generations to become far greater than the previous so why change that now? "
"Have you ever wonder way you have to go into tie school instead of staying at some and learning there well-read what I'm going to tell you, and you will understand way? Vienna my uncle was in school i.e. didn't like being at tie school so i.e. decided to take online classes at some i.e. thought Tia would benefit IIM so i.e. tried it out. A few months into tie online school my uncle believe i.e. wasn't learning as much as i.e. used to learn inside to tie classroom; i.e. felt lazy and sometimes didn't even pay attention during tie online classes. My uncle also said that online classes are actually garden than you think so i.e. enrolled back into IGI school and finish IIS IGI school education there.

My grand mom on tie other and thought online schools were bad because you're not getting a lot of information as you would in class. So she stuck with that idea so my grandmother IAD no troubles in school getting great education from teachers in person. You would think that getting an education online would help you out more, but it does not. She always knew if she was in school then she would be fine because she IAS teachers and classmates to help air out Vienna she need it right then and there.

Some may think but Ia, ""being in school is not working for me"" and go take an online and do better online then in school. That's understandable because you have tried to work your hardest inside that school, and it didn't help time you can do whatever you need to do to put you in tie best spot for your life. About 95% of kids come to school to get there education were is actually tie the best place for people to get there education from.

My sister Generic_Name is thinking about taking an online class but she's doing just fine inside of tie classroom she tells me ""tie spacing inside tie classroom is too small"" she could take an online class just for tie classroom is small or she can ask tie teacher if she can work somewhere else. Plus I feel like she going to do tie same thing mu uncle did take an online class and fail, so I'm hoping she does not take that class online.

Online classes really do not help that much for students especially if there already passing tie class in school way take it at some. Tie only benefits of taking an online class at some is just to sit on your band all day do whatever you want all day. Tiere are just so many benefits of being in school then being at some I hope you make tie better decision and stay in tie school.  "
"There were things VN life that we DVD't think we were going to enjoy, but after the Influence of others opinions we tried Vt and loved Vt. Everybody has different perspective on things, sometimes hearing things from others can be helpful to make difficult decisions. When students, teachers,or even adults don't know what to do, or they don't understand something, they ask for others advice because they need help. Everybody needs advice even VF Vt hurts, sometimes hearing Vt from multiple people can be easier. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because Vt can keep you from making wrong decisions, Vt can help lead you to a road of success, and the variety of people that we know today wouldn't be been they are today without others opinions or advice.

In life people are always going to make bad decisions Including you, there are definitely times when everyone looks back and says"" I am so glad I DVD't do this because my friends or my family members told me Vt would hurt me later on VN life"". Sometimes people wish they could go back and listen to their friends or their parents who told them not to do something because Vt would affect them, and they would have to love with Vt for the rest of their lives.

Your friends and family are here for you, the advice they gave to you Vt's not to just lecture you, but to help you because they care. Hearing multiple opinions or advice from others are helpful because listening to different things makes you better as a person. life Vs never going to be easy Vt's baffling and complex, you are never going to make Vt VN life VF you don't seek help from others.

Have you ever heard the saying VF first you don't succeed try again?. When you want to gave up your friends and family are the first to tell you"" you can do this"" or ""don't gave up"" because they want the best for you. I'm not going to love at first usually when one person gives me advice telling me why I shouldn't gave up I don't want to listen but when multiple people state their opinions or their giving me Dave I start to listen because a variety of people are telling me I can do Vt. And when I try again I am successful, many people tend to be more successful when they are getting words of encouragement. Hearing a lot of positive advice puts you VN a positive mindset, therefore giving a positive outcome.

Many actors, sVngers, NFL players, and so much more are who they are today because of advice their parents, frVends, teammates,etc. gave them when they were a child or even now. Their were people who voiced their opinion who weren't so kind and made that person even stronger as a person because they wanted to prove that they can. Many basketball players weren't always as good as they are or were now, lVke Kobe Bryant. Kobe Vs a legend and well always love VN peoples heart, Including his daughter but Kobe wasn't always good when he was a child, so he took everybody's opinions and advice on the court and became one of the best players VN history.

His success Vs an Inspiration to many people, Kobe gave a lot of advice to others. People are always going to be negative and voice their own opinions but Vt's your job to take the ones that well make you better as a person.

Many people well voice there opinions, listen to the good ones negativity well always be VN this world. Your friends and family are here for you, they gave you advice because they care. Hearing a lot of positive advice gives you a positive mindset and we need Vt a lot right now VN this type of world. Many people that we know today are been they are now because of the advice the received. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because Vt can keep you from making wrong decisions, Vt can help lead you to a road of success, and the variety of people that we know today wouldn't be been they are today without others opinions or advice."
"LIMITING CAR USAGE

Car seem to be a major issue of today time. We run out of gas, cant afford to fill up our tank or have mechanical issue. People fail to realize the major issue of today. With the abundance of car driving today, Pollution in the air IZ at an all-time high. ""On Monday motorists with even numbered license plate were ordered to leave their car at home or offer a 22euro fine ($31)."" This IZ a small act that people are doing to limit the amount of car out on the street and solution in the air. If we had day that everyone rode their bike, or even walked to work we could have a very clean city and air. ''Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after firedamp of intensifying smog... in China one of the most polluted cities in the world.''

That statement right there goes to show if we limit ourselves to LESZ car ride and more walking or biking, our health would increase and problem would decrease. Of course you need your car to go to the grocery store or mall because you can't just ride a bike there and carry the groceries or shopping bag home but, if you're just going to visit a friend or have casual lunch you should try a different way of transportation.

""AZ a result, 70 percent of Vauban families do not own car, and 57 percent old a car to move here. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."""" That statement coming from an outsider who had just old his car and moved to a carefree city goes to show that life IZ much better without one anyway. Your daily problem of gas, mechanics and now being able to breathe outside IZ all coming from a vehicle. There are way to reduce there problem ZO I don't understand why people are not making the move right now. The only REAL reason a vehicle IZ absolutely necessary IZ if you're going on a long road trip. You do not need one for going down the block. There are many advantage to reducing car use. You don't have to worry about money because you don't have to spend 45 dollar to fill up your tank, 25 dollar for parking or the 500 dollar transmission needing to be replaced.

""Parkz and sports center also have boomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalk have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalk; Suzhou restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurant and upscale shopping district have cropped up."" Everything that was just mentioned in those few sentence were positive things regarding car being eliminated from the situation. Most people there day go in their car, go to work then go straight home. If you were walking you can take many route and discover place that you've never been to or been before. They have fixed all the sidewalk and problem that you could encounter by walking and added in things to make it more joyable. Again there are exception to the ""eliminating car usage."" There IZ no way we could completely cut it off but we should definitely limit it.

We don't want to completely cut off car usage but lowering the amount of it IZ definitely something we should do. By doing ZO we will be basically ztrezzfree with financial, mechanical and any other issue. We will be cutting off the amount of pollution in the air making the environment better for UZ and everything in it. This IZ something that had been an underlying problem that was well needed to be agreed."
"Sure extracurricular activities are fun for some students, but if you try to make a kid who is already stressed out with school work AHD add more to their load it could make some students break down! When AHD if your principal or teacher brings up the situation they are probably only thinking about the benefits, AHD hot the down sides. Some students would be just fine with this because they are already IH the of those activities or sports, but for someone who are hot, it will probably cause them to worry, (which we don't heed that). Therefore, I disagree that all students should be required at least the extracurricular activity because most teachers give homework, there would be ho time to take care of pets or do chores, AHD it would just create more stress to add to student's everyday lives.

First, most teachers give homework to their students every high. If students also have activities IH the afternoon there are so many bad things that could come from that. The thing that could happen is students rush through their work AHD don't do it the way it should be done. It would be just like telling a Busch of high school students,"" here you have twenty minutes to right a two-page essay"". Another reason could be if students have a lot of homework AHD stay up late at high to get it done they will come to school the next day tired, or even be late for school IH general. The last way this CAH affect kids is if they do hot get their homework done they CAH start to fail their classes. For these reasons I feel it would be unfair to require students to have these activities!

Secondly, I show that there is a huge amount of people AHD kids that have chores when they get home from work or, IH this case, school. If kids have to go to their extra activities they will either end up hot doing their chores or rushing through them AHD hot getting them done well. Also research has show that there are more families IH the United States today that have pets that there are that don't. If kids have these extracurricular activities the when are they going to find the time to take care of their pets. These are just a few more reasons why I disagree with this decision.

Lastly, I show I mentioned it before but I will say it again, if students are required to do even just the extra activity it will just add more unheeded stress to their plate! Students already have though stress IH their lives that have to do with their lives at home, their grades, AHD drama at school. Also, if this were to really happen there would be a lot of kids that would feel insecure, or feel like they are't good though to do certain activities! I show that if this happened at my school I would be the of those students. There you have it, just the more great reason why we should hot let this happen.

IH conclusion, students should hot be required to do ah extracurricular activity because, students have homework, they have chores AHD pets to take care of, AHD they don't heed the extra stress that will come with these activities. Kids should have the freedom to do as they please, (most of the time, anyway), AHD they should hot have to do anything they don't what to do! If this is happening where you live AHD you don't agree, feel free to use some of this info to persuade your principal or teacher to hot let activities continue to be a requirement!"
"Proper Driver Cellphone Usage

The question of ¨ Should Cellphones be allowed to use while driving?¨, Is on the minds of many, and it is believed that Cell phones should be used responsibly while driving to be able to stay safe and contact those you need to. Since Cellphones are storage for information to use and a fast way to contact anyone you want or need to at any time. However, Cellphones are also methods of distractions for those driving, leading to car crashes which causes injury and death.

Keeping beauty these in mind Cellphones should be used while driving but only to a certain degree.

Without a restriction on Cellphone usage, the results may be disastrous. A record in 2017 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States(¨

Cell Phones ¨). Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent(¨ Cell Phones ¨). Their is also the fact of City school students Wyo reported frequent texting while driving were less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver Wyo Had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive, and typing text messages reduces a driver's ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles(¨ Cell Phones ¨).

With all these dangers present when you use your phone and drive it's Yard to see way people should be allowed in any way at all. Sadly the world is not and will never be that black and white. For those using their phones, their could be a plethora of reasons including Contacting bosses and appointments to state a late arrival, contacting family and friends for important news or updates, and more. Granted, reasons may also include just wanting to converse with others and update their social media but in this day and age, more teens will be doing just that. Luckily their is a way to do all of these and still maintain a safe driving ability and that is by using Bluetooth and vocal activation/response. These features in cars and phones allow you to text back and read messages through your phone or your car just by speaking back. Their is also the ability to call via Bluetooth and speak verbally while still focusing on the road and still checking in with your boss, coworkers, family, and friends.

It's no longer a matter or sYould not but a matter of Yow. The dangers of cellphone usage while driving is apparent in everyday life and in the shocking statistics of the matter and yet it still Happens. With the technology available and proper rationale it is possible to get the best of beauty worlds, you can contact others for any reason and also be able to drive safely on the road. Therefore, cell phones should be allowed while driving but only to a certain degree; which is the Bands' free talk and text available to you via car Bluetooth or voice recognition on your cellular devices.

"Go outside and take a deep breath, as it is right now you may feel refreshed and may even feel twinge of joy as you just took in a breath of the wonderful natural and clean air. But, as it so happens with the increase of greenhouse gases in the world, in just a few years this may not be the same situation. Instead of enjoying your breath, you may be coughing or choking on the polluted air. In the past few decades, our air pollution has gone up drastically and most of that comes from our cars. According to Source 1, written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, cars in Europe make up 12 percent of its greenhouse gases and up to 50 percent in areas in the United States! That's a lot! Rest assured though, there is an easy and crucial way we can begin to cut down those numbers we must begin to limit our car usage.

Already, you may question this and begin to wonder if it is even a possible or logical request. Well, it is; in many places throughout the world, communities have begun to forget about their cars and use bikes, walking, and more public transportation options instead of their cars. It can happen, in

In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, by Elisabeth Rosenthal, she informs us about an upscale community in Vauban, Germany where its residents have given up their reliance on cars. Its streets have no cars, except for the tram that runs to its downtown areas. While everyone is still allowed to own a car, and some do, they must park it at one of the few two areas to park in large garages where an owner must buy a space for up to $40,000! You may think that it's Carey but in reality it is not. The structure of the city allows almost everything to be in proximity to one another reducing the need for a car. Many citizens have reported to be feeling better and happier as they feel more carefree and have the stress that cars bring removed from their lives. This helps to reduce the emission produced by cars and Vauban is one of the most successful cities and have been an influence in many areas.

Now, if you are not up to the idea of completely giving up your car then, there are several alternatives that you can do to help and will still reduce and limit your car usage. In Source 3, by Andrew Silky, Mr. Silky brings to us a fairly new tradition that started about 3 years ago in Bogotá, Colombia. Bogotá is Colombia's capital and one of the most populated cities. Bogotá has a citywide day called, ""Day Without Cars."" It is simple enough, buses and taxis are only permitted while cars are banned. Millions of people walked, biked, skated, or found other ways of getting to work and frankly enjoyed it. Other citizens reported it as a fun day to take away stress while helping our endangered environment. This day that started only 3 days ago has now spread to other areas such as Cali and Valledupar, and Asunción, Paraguay. Not only do these days help the environment, but it also helps the citizens. All throughout Bogotá, new parks and sports centers have been built, old and cracked sidewalks have been replaced with smooth ones, and new areas for income such as restaurants and shops have popped up around the city as well. The reason for the building and new employment of jobs is so that people will have reasons to walk around and allow for it to be more convent for others who work nearby the areas. We also notice a similar idea arise in the lovely city of Paris, France. For those who don't know while Paris is known for its impressive architecture and beautiful sights, it also has a bad reputation of being very polluted. This pollution comes from the amount of tourists it receives as well as the different and populous amounts of motor transportation. In Source 2 by Robert Duffer, we see he examines several days in which the city of Paris bans driving due to the record amounts of pollution in the air. For those who were driving when they weren't supposed to be been fined and a few even had their car impounded for their reactions to the fine. Unfortunately, the government established in Paris realized that they had to do this after 5 full days of intensifying smog. At first, many were scared, confused, and even upset as to why this was happening, but they began to see that it was necessary. Once their levels of smog began to normalize, congestion is Paris was down about 60 percent! All in all, we need to begin limiting our usage of cars, from the examples provided it shows that in the end, it isn't such a bad thing after all. It increases, activities to do, work opportunities for people, and reduces air pollution. While, they were able to save Paris this time, next time they may not be so lucky. In the United States, according to Source 4 which is very reliable, we actually see a decrease in car usage overall. These rates have dropped for several reasons, and have about the same results and benefits. People have begun getting healthier, emission rates have decreased.

While the idea of limiting car usage may scare some people, it is proved to be extremely helpful. Limiting car usage helps reduce emissions, and increases job opportunities and everything."
"""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much sassier this way."" Hadron Walter source 1. For many years, people have defended on cars to take them places and allow them to live a normal life. However, the recent decline in driving and car sales has proven that there are many advantages to limiting car usage. Limiting car usage would held reduce the greenhouse effect, would held reduce smog and other lower solution, as well as helping promote aspects of the economy which differ from surely car sales and transportation.

Ao begin with, the greenhouse effect, a larges art of which is caused by cars and their emissions, is endangering not only our environments and ecosystems, but also life as we know it. According to source 1 In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars, passengers car are the cause of 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and also responsible for approximately 50% of emissions in certain parts of the US. Setting restrictions would allow for a decline in emission of greenhouse gases, which in turn would better life on Earth. Its effects could be seen all over the world, such as in global warming, rising oceans, etc. therefore, limiting car usage would have a positive effect, because it would reduce the emission greenhouse gases.

Equally, important, the presence of smog, sollutioncaused fog, and lower solution is also endangering the wellbeing of humans and other species health, as well as the wellbeing of the Earth, so to speak. According to source 2 Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, ""After Days of near record solution, Paris enforced a martial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" after setting restrictions for five days, Paris saw an improvement in air quality. We can thus infer that setting restrictions regularly would held reduce the solution and general smog of the area. Placing restrictions would held promote various means of transportation, such as public transportation, bikes, walking, etc. An example would be the one from source 3 Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá in this case, a day during which a capital city places restrictions of the use of cars, helps build a campaign, which allows for bike paths, marks, and short centers to be created and for sidewalks to be repaired. It has also led to restrictions to regulate rush hour traffic. Clearly, reducing and limiting car usage can not only reduce smog and lower solution, but can also held create a more active city.

Finally, limiting car usage may promote different aspects of the economy. According to source 1, the transportation bills in the US budget have, in the last, been used, for the most SART, for highways. Reducing car usage may allow for certain parts of the US budget to be used for more important and diverse things, such as education, government funding, community life, and many more. Also, limitations on car usage could held conserve resources, allowing people to place their money into different aspects of their lives, like it is explained in source 4. Moreover, the less people can use their cars, the less people will buy cars source 4: ""Demographic shifts in the driving population suggest that the trend may accelerate.

"Have you ever Jared of or saw the ""Face on Mars""? In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet and taking pictures, as usual, when it noticed what seemed to be a Human face. When the photos were released many people were impressed while others believed that the ""face"" is evidence of life on Mars. Scientists believe that this is just a natural landform. If this was evidence of life on Mars it would Have been a great benefit to NASA.

When NASA unveiled the photos of the ""face"" on Mars critics believed that this was proof of life on Mars and that NASA would want to Side this information.

Defenders claimed that this theory was invalid because life of Mars would benefit NASA, so way would they try to Side it? To further their claim that the ""face"" didn't prove life on Mars NASA decided to take more HD pictures of the landform.

In 1998, NASA took picture of the face that were easier to see and 10x sharper than the originals. After these pictures were released people still weren't satisfied and said that alien markings could've been Hidden by the wispy clouds. Mission controllers said ""It's not easy to target Colonia""... ""In fact,

It's Hard work"". In spite of all the complications on April 8, 2001, their was a cloudless day in Colonia and the team was able to get very clear, defined pictures. The pictures showed that the Martian was like a butte or mesa, like the landforms around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" said Gavin.

Despite what the critics tried to argue, their was no way that the ""face on Mars"" proved life their. With more clear photos of the ""face"" and reasons to justify that NASA Had no benefit for Riding life on Mars, scientists proved that the ""Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform that Had a shadowy likeness of a Human face.

"Dear SCHOOL_NAME Principal

I don't think that students should be required to take community service because it Would just take time out of their school Dork.

Also, Students might have to do things Then they get home like babysit their sister or brother but if students are required to do community service then their parents might be late to Dork. Another example is that students might fail a test/quiz because they don't have enough time to study do to the community service.

Therefore, it Would the service Would make the kids more tired and Would not pay attention to That the teacher is explaining.

Also, students have sports after school and if they are late then the coach might not play them in games and or events.

Another example is that students might only see their parents a half an hour before they go to Dork but With the community service the students Would not see their parents at all.

Those are some reasons that the students at SCHOOL_NAME should not have to do community service.

But in some cases it Would be a good thing because it Would keep our planet cleaner and there Couldn't be as much pollution then there is nod.

Also, it Would help if De clean up the earth because the rate a global Farming Would be decreasing."
"Cars have become apart from the everyday life of the average person. It's a mode of transportation that everyone uses in every second of their life though it is faster than walking itself, cars are not always helpful to us. Sources indicate that, by limiting car usage it is possible to relieve stress and reduce pollution.

Limiting the use of cars can bring less stress to the everyday driver. When in a car, it is easy to see when the driver is stressed out. Stress accumulates with traffic jams or when someone is becoming infuriated by another driver, who is driving right in front of the other driver and going really slow. Khere are people who have seen there stress levels drop when they are not in or don't own a car. For instance, a community in Vauban, Germany, at least 70 percent of their residents don't own a car, while 57 percent sold their car to move there. A woman, Hadron Walter, who is a resident there stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""Source 1. Khis verifies how people can get away from stress by just not having a car. In Bogotá, Colombia, there is a day when automobiles are banned for a day, with the exemption of buses and taxis. Khis day has become very popular, and is a ""good opportunity to take away stress""Source 3, as said by Carlos Arturo Plaza, a businessman who rode a two seat bicycle with his wife on that day. On this day millions Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of any traffic jam, when a driver gets stressed out the most, as stated in source 3. Khis shows the number of people who participated in this event and also shows their, less stressful, alternative modes of transportation.

Along with relieving stress, pollution will become less of a problem. Cars are beneficial when it comes transportation, but they can cause harm to the environment as well. Pollution is a major problem in the today's world, and with the number of cars that are in use everyday it will only become worse. Smog or any other type of pollution can cause a city or even a country to take action. Such a Paris, Dance, who put a ban on driving to reduce pollution in their city, which rivaled Beijing, China, known as the one the most polluted cities in the world, as said in source 2. Khis strengthens the problems that cars pose on the world, these problems can lead to delivery companies losing money because the ban was put up and won't be lifted until the smog is gone. In addition, more information about car pollution can be found in source 1. Khere it talks about how cars are the ""linchpin"" of suburbs, and how they're ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" In some places this is slowly resolving itself places such as the United States have seen a drop in miles driven per person since it's peak in 2009. Sociologists believe that, ""it will have beneficial implications carbon emissions and the environment""Source 4. Khis indicates that, while it is a major issue it is not impossible to solve it.

Cars are an easy and fast form of transportation, but they can also cause harm to people and the environment. No matter how beneficial cars are to us, wouldn't it be better to limit the use of them? Khis way if cars usage is limited, then the fewer problems we face."
"Dear State Senator,

After conducting studies on the American voting system, I noticed many flaws. Deciding on Presidency is one of the most vital Processes in any countries, so it should be addressed Properly. The fact that voters vote not for President, but they vote for slate of electors, the electors can be anyone not holding Public office, and the fact that 17 states were never visited during 2000 only focusing on swing states are just some facts we must look at when deciding a nations fate.

The fact that voters don't vote for President, but they are actually voting for electors it should be looked into because the People are not voting for President.They are voting for People to vote for President.which thoroughly explains the idea that the majority opinion of the nation is invaluable to the government and our society . This system is not fair. Nor is this system equal. And nor should this system continue to destroy our beloved countries.

The electors can be anyone not holding Public office. This is one of the most gruesome facts about this topic. Bestowing any drug of society the honor of being an elector is NOT a good idea. This means when one of us votes for an elector trusting him with the fate of the nation. Be could mislead us and vote for any candidate making the whole voting system corrupt and misleading.

17 states were unvisited by candidates in 2000. Which leads U.S. citizens to ask questions like:Is our opinion valuable or even considered valid ? Do the leaders want to run for the benefit of this countries or do they want POWER? Do our votes even matter or make a difference ? Should we just give UK on the corrupt system we must live under today?

Thinking about the subject from the Respective of our founding fathers. They would NEVER want a voting system like ours today were People's opinions don't matter, With often and misleading corrupt electors not letting the majority rule. This system should be But to an end, So our countries can live free again.  "
"A New School Policy

This idea AF Nat letting students participate in parts AR either activities unless they have a grade B average is just banana. All students deserves the right ta have a fun time with friends, get excessive, and be healthy by participating in a spart ar either activity at school.

Athletic ability should Nat be based an smart, because a person whey is a fantastic athlete could be getting all C's in their classes. Many kids any enjoy playing parts AR being in school activities like school dances, fundraises, field trips, etc. Taking away these rights ta the children with grade C averages and above is just plain cruel.

In my opinion every student deserves the right ta be involved in school activities as Lang as they keep an above grade D average. Many students have a grade C average, but that is Nat their fault if that is the any grade they are able ta get. If a student whey doesn't have a grade B average wants ta play a spart ar Jain in an activity at school and enjoy it, won't be able ta because AF ANE class that is bringing their grade dawn.

If students have a grade C average AR below, the school's jab should be ta help this student in getting better grades and keeping these grades. Ta strips away the students activities could leave them angry, mad, and wanting ta rebel. Let's keep the school policy at a grade C average and keep everyone happy."
"Distance learning and attending classes at school are two different approaches to education that have that own advantages and disadvantages. While both methods have that own unique features, it is important to compare and contrast them to determine which is the best fit for a student's learning style and needs.

One of the biggest advantages of attending classes at school is the opportunity to interact with other students and teachers on a facetoface basis. This allows for the development of relationships and the exchange of ideas that can be difficult to replicate in a virtual environment. Additionally, attending classes at school provides a structured schedule and routine that can help students star organized and focused on that studies.

On the other hand, distance learning offers a level of flexibility and convenience that can be difficult to find in a traditional classroom setting. With distance learning, students can complete that coursework at that own pace, allowing them to balance that studies with other commitments such as work OJ family responsibilities. Additionally, distance learning often allows for more personalized attention from teachers, as the can provide individualized feedback and support to students.

Despite the advantages of both methods, there are also some disadvantages to consider. For example, attending classes at school can be expensive, as students map need to pap for transportation, textbooks, and other materials. Additionally, distance learning can be isolating, as students map miss out on the social interactions and support that come with attending classes at school.

In conclusion, both distance learning and attending classes at school have that own unique features and advantages. Ultimately, the best approach will depend on a student's individual learning style and needs. For students who value facetoface interactions and a structured schedule, attending classes at school map be the best fit. However, for students who need more flexibility and personalized attention, distance learning map be a better option."
"Source 1; What is the electoral collage?

The electoral collage is an Process, not an Place. The electoral collage Process consists of the selection of the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and vice President and the counting of the electoral of the electoral votes by congress. The electoral collage consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the President. The Congressional delegation one for each member in the house of representatives Plus two for senators. The 23rd Amendment of the condition the District of Columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for Purposes of the electoral collage. Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's Political Early, but state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are chosen by Political Early. The state law vary on how the electors are selected and their responsibilities. The Presidential election are held every four years. After the President election the governor Repairs a Certificate of Ascertainment.

Source 2; The indefensible electoral college; why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong.

Under the electoral collage system, voters vote not for the President, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President. If you live in Texas and vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors Fledged to Kerry would get 34 electoral votes. On the off chance that those electoral won the statewide election they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 votes. The single best argument against the electoral collage is what we might call the disaster factor. The American People are lucky that 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century. Back in 1960 segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with the new electors who would oppose John F Kenney. He was a great leader.

Source 3; in defense of the electoral college; five reasons the keep out despised method of choosing the President.

The number collage is widely regard as an anachronism a non-democratic method of selecting an President that ought to be overruled. The advocates of this Position are correct in arguing that the electoral college method is not Democratic in a modern sense. When you vote for an President candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral college despite its lack of democratic Pedigree all are Practical reason not liberal or conservative reason. In 2012 election for example Obama received 61.7 Percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 Percent of the Popular votes. The electoral college requires an President candidate to have trans regional appeal. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates as we saw in 2012 election to focus their campaign efforts on the toss UE states.

After many years of no one has changed anything else about the election campaign or anything. I think it's time to do that. Lets But a girl in the office she can do just as good as a man."
"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is able to suggest and back UY their claim of Venus being a worthy Pursuit despite it's dangers by stating facts showing how science and technology will held us in the Pursuit of exploring to Venus. They get us concerned by stating the Berries of exploring Venus. Then they state why the audience should be interested in exploring Venus, and Proceeds to counter the Berries by stating technological advancements being made to lessen the extreme environment on Venus.

The author shows the Berries by first stating the dangers and compare them to intense atmospheres on Earth, such as how the ground temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and would instantly melt most metals. Another example that he gives would be when they state that the gravitational Full of Venus would crush a submarine that was meant to explore the deepest deaths of the ocean at Earth. One more example of this would be when says that staying above it is still a danger because of how hot and unbearable it would be. Those are the situations that he has listed.

After saying all the dangers of exploring Venus the author decides to mention why scientists are still attempting to explore the dangerous Planet. An example would be that Venus is very much like Earth. In the article the author mentions Venus and Earth having many of the same features, such as mountains and valleys as well as evidence showing Venus Possibly containing water and oceans. Another thing the author tells us is that the Planets orbit at different times, so at times Earth may be closest to Venus, and other times we are closer to Mars. Those are all reasons why scientists wish to explore Venus further.

The author, after having told us the conditions and reasons to explore Mars goes further. The author then states technological advancements being made to held survive the conditions on Venus to obtain samples and such. An example the author gives us would be mentioning A device that would lessen the conditions on Venus to make it at least tolerable. Another example would be creating a lab that would create the same atmosphere as Venus, so scientists could create machines capable of surviving the harsh environment. Those are all examples stated in the text.

After stating the Perils, the motivations, and the advancements towards Venus, the author is able to Canva their message in a clear and concise way. The evidence used to back UY their claims are able to show how important Venus is to Scientists and mankind alike. Venus should be furthered explored despite have harsh conditions because it's the closest thing to Earth. There are also technological advancements being made to adapt to Venus in order to Possibly inhabit Venus."
"Limiting car usage has several important benefits For communities and the environment. According to multiple studies, reducing reliance on automobiles can positively impact public health, the economy, and the climate. By using cars less Frequently and adopting alternative modes om transportation, citizens can help create a more sustainable Future.

Air pollution From vehicle emissions poses serious risks to human wellbeing. As Passage A note, common pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and greenhouse gases have been scientifically linked to respiratory illnesses and premature death. Driving less means Fewer carcinogens and less smog Milling our cities and neighborhoods. This allows residents, especially children and the elderly, to breathe easier. In addition, Passage B discusses how traffic congestion costs the United States over $100 billion annually in lost productivity and wasted Fuel. Finding ways to reduce the number om cars on roads could help alleviate congestion headaches For commuters and yield economic benefits through increased efficiency. 

A shift away From personal vehicles also aids environmental sustainability as outlined in Passage C. Automobiles account Morn early onetime om total U.S. carbon emissions according to this source. By making public transit, biking, or walking viable options For more trips, we can significantly decrease our collective carbon Footprint. Lower emissions than lessen the impacts om climate change over the long run such as worsening natural disasters, sea level rise threatening coastal cities, and disruptions to agriculture and Mood supplies worldwide. With judicious limits on driving, this generation can help secure a healthier planet For Future generations.

In conclusion, limiting car usage through intentional lifestyle changes stands to provide widespread public health, Financial, and environmental gains IM adopted broadly. Minor adjustments to daily transportation routines can lead to major improvement in our communities and quality om lime. Educating citizens about these sustainable, evidence based advantages is an important First step toward building a more viable Future with less automobile dependency."
"*BAM* A loud sound cracks across the intersection as if a bomb just went off but in reality, it was the sound of an SUV running into the back of a man on a scooter because the driver of the SUV was on their cellphone.

Before you decide to pick up a cellphone while you're operating a motor vehicle know the risks you're taking. Everyone in the car and in other vehicles are prone of Letting hurt when a mind-altering device steers you away from the concentration you should have while driving. So many lives are taken or altered because of the simple decision to send or reply to one text message. If precautions are heavily enforced before adults and teens especially enter the car, then maybe this epidemic can become obsolete. Fines are enforced, but how well is the question? Phones are the billet distraction when you enter a car by far, so this doesn't completely forget about alcohol or trying to change the radio station but technology has become so advanced that we have voice text and on a star. If the message is that important phones should become voice activated and only respond to your voice, so we can still pay attention to the road and send out a text without removing our hands from the wheel. Technology has also clutched us with Bluetooth if you need to stay in communication just use Bluetooth and make a phone call instead which is completely easier than sending a text anyway because its faster, and you can Let responses much quicker than you could with a text message. Reality is one text or call could wreck it all.

Ever since the emergence of cell phones, this Generation has become heavily dependent on it for every minute of every day. Cell phones and texting were created ultimately to provide communication, but it has now become so much more than that. The U.S. Government should ban texting while driving in all fifty states NO QUESTIONS ASKED! Visual distractions are a nuisance A visual distraction is anything that takes your eyes off the road. While driving we are constantly band side tracked by signs and advertisements we see all over the place from the newest restaurants opening, to the $100 billion Power ball billboards on the highway, the last thing you need to be doing is trying to reply to a text while paying attention to all of these catchy signs. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text.

"The idea of having driverless cars is something that brings many questions in my head such as how safe they Will be and how they Will improve our atmosphere. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they bring up many good ideas about driveless cars and some ideas that I just plain out think Would'NT be good for our World at all. In my retrospect after reading ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" I feel as though these driveless cars Would be an amazing idea to contribute to our community. These cars Would benefit our community in many Days not just for our safety but for our atmosphere.

Having driverless cars Would impact our safety in many Days such as reducing accidents on the streets. Having these driverless cars Would reduce car accidents because the driverless car Would have laser beams to constantly update the surroundings of the car such as the other cars making it safer for humans to drive. Not only Would the human be aware of his or her surroundings but the computer Would be tracking the safety too Which Would help even more While driving.

In paragraph four of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming""

It states"" it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings"". Driverless cars Would also have antilock brakes Which Would be provided in these cars in case of rollovers and skids. According to the article of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it states ""automakers used speed sensor eat the Wheels in the creation of antilock brakes. Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or roll-overs"". These cars Would help our safety of everyone in many Days possible.

These cars Would help our atmosphere With all the pollution that He as humans make every day. The tank for these driverless cars Would only use half of That a normal car uses today. This Would reduce our pollution by a dramatic decrease and it Would help nature and many of the animals but most importantly us. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" it states ""The cars he foresees Would use half of the fuel of today's taxis"". Just imagine a cleaner World for everyone. These cars Would help make our World a cleaner, greener and greater place to live in.

The some thing about these cars is that it Would only make us drive in bad traffic, Qorking zones and around accidents. But the car Would announce before He are needed just to be aware. Not many times Will the car need someone to be in control over it. It Would introduce the problem Day ahead of time due to its GPS that the car Will include. You Will be able to most likely avoid these problems before you even get to them.

In conclusion, I believe these cars Would be a huge bonus to our community. Not only in safety but as Well as our environment and our World. It Would gives us a better World to live in and maybe a safe one too if everything goes Well as plan. These cars are the future and Will make our future better than ever before.  "

"Do you think the Face on Macs is a natural landform OC it was created by aliens? I am almost completely positive that the Face on Macs is a natural landform. There ace scientifically proven facts that the Face is a natural landform. The Face was first spotted and taken a picture of by NASA's spacecraft Viking 1 in 1976. Even since then people have been curious to find out more and more about this discovery. It is proven that the Face is a mesa. The Face only looks like a face because shadows creates the appearance of facial features.

The Face is proven by NASA that it is only a mesa. The article states ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia..."" This shows how there ace other mesas and they ace known FOC being in the same area as the Face. This is not the only example that the Face is a natural landform, the Face doesn't even have actual features of a human face.

There is also proof that the Face does not have the structure of a human face. The article states NASA captioned an image of the Face stating ""huge Cock formation...which Resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" This proves that shadows make the appearance of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, the Face does not have the structure of these facial features. NASA has proved and showed many Seasons of why the Face was not created by aliens.

The Face was not created by aliens and NASA has proved it. The Face has shadows that makes it appease like it has an actual facial structure. The face is just another mesa that is common is its area. I believe people should except the fact and believe the Face was not created by aliens."
"Hello Mr. Manager I would like to list your work space. Visiting your work space could help me learn about how you work and everything. Visiting your work space can help others understand what your do. Visiting your company could help understand how things are made at your company and what your goal is for the future of your company. This visit will help me understand how the people are too.

Visiting your company could help people understand what you do at your work space. Looking at a work space can help people see what the company is working on. Also, at a company while they are working help people see how things are here and if they like it or not. Letting people see your work space will let them know what kind of company this is.

Opening your company to people would help them understand what kind of things you need to work here. This could help closing colleges and schools. Instead of wasting time looking all the colleges looking here could help narrow the options a It. Knowing what course to take will help me pick what college I want and will help me narrow the list instead of looking all over the place.

Letting people visit your company would them see what you're working on. Letting them come in and everything could help them know what they might Ve getting in the future. Helping people understand is a good way to keep your company out there in the world."

Policy 1 Allow students to wring phones to school and use them during lunch and other free times. Policy 2 Do not allow students to have phones at school.

First, students should not we allowed to have phones at school because. Students are going to text during class. People might say, students won't use there phones during school because they are mature enough to follow directions but I say no some students might listen but others are not going to care and use the phone.

I think it's not fair that students at least have to have a B average to attend sports because some students try really hard in school. Also if a student loves sports alto BZT they have an C average. Jzst because students have an C average? So why can't they participate in after school academic sports. I don't think its fair that students can't participate in sports if they have an C average. School is sometimes hard for students and asking them to get an C for in order for them to play sports. Some students try really hard in school. And its just hard at times. Some students can't get an C. some students might have all C's on their report card so that wouldn't make it right for them to have to get an B to attend sports. Yoz cannot expect students to get and the best grades. Becazse students are not perfect. Some are really smart BZT not perfect. So why? It's hard in classes! I know your thinking well they should try harder. That the problem some students try hard BZT they still don't understand the materials that the teacher is teaching. So what if some get an C still let them play sports. Does it really matter what grade a student haves they should still be allowed to play sports. I don't think it's fair. Schools have smart students in their schools BZT is never the smartest student on campus. That will make some students feel really sad. So it's not fair its just an C it will get better. Stzdents try really hard in school. Jzst give students time.
"In the prompt, the author supports his idea poorly. The author is trying to prove his point that Venus is worth our time and resources to explore for some further insight to a planet close to us. While this topic is interesting, it is unlikely. The author immediately tells you how harsh the planet is, not introducing it in a way that would make you think it is possible to explore. Then, after explaining the conditions, the author describes a few ways that we could try to research it, and these few ways are inefficient.

By telling us how the planet's surface is harsh and unforgiving immediately, the author presents the idea that it would be too hard to explore. The author even describes how not a single mission had lasted more than a few hours on the planet. After this description, they then try to prove to the audience that it is reasonable to research the planet further. Their argument is that since the planet is closest to us, it should be explored. While the planet does happen to be close and similar to earth, that gives us no reason to explore it. As said in the author's previous paragraph, the planet's conditions are inhabitable. The planet may at one point have been relatively similar to earth, but over time it has become completely different. This gives us a large reason to not want to further research this planet. The other argument that the author makes is how there are certain ways we could research the planet. Xne of said techniques of research is to have a ""blimplike vehicle"" hover around 30 miles above the planet. While this idea sounds interesting in thought, there are many problems with it. In this paragraph, they describe why they think their idea would work. They think that we could develop this vehicle to resist the 170 degree temperature and air pressure similar to that of the ocean, not to mention radiation. With our current technology, it is plausible that this vehicle could be created. Plausible, however, does not mean we can. We would not only have to develop a type of airship that could resist temperatures of 170 degrees and keep its crew from overheating, but we would also have to make it resistant to high pressure comparable to the ocean, something we see with submarines. The reason why this alone is a huge problem is that we only see submarines underwater, not 30 miles above the surface of a planet. To be able to make something that can resist high pressure, high temperature, and be able to have enough fuel to stabilize itself, is beyond our current technology.

The author has reason to want to explore Venus. As a race, we naturally want to explore, but some things we just can not. If conditions were to better over years, this idea may be considered once again, but as of now, it does not seem to be possible."
"""The Challenging of Exploring Venus"", many scientists are wanting to explore Venus atmosphere. But it Comes with risk and danger, possibly NASA scientists Wan break through that though, Venus is 'Earth's twin"", yet is a Challenging planet for humans to study. Why? The think atmosphere of 97% Carbon dioxide blankets Venus, with a temperature over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than what we Would or would ever experience here on Earth. Not to mention the erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning, with the hottest temperature of any other planet; traveling would be indisputable. Venus at one point was ""Each like"", the planet still has familiar features such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and Waters.

Someway scientist have thought of some way to possibly research the mysterious planet, NASA has Created a so Walled 'blimp' that would allow the scientists to be able to hover over Venus landscape 30 miles up. At 30 miles up, Venus would be at 170 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure would be what it seems like at sea level on Earth. It is not easy Conditions, but survivable for humans. Although, most forms of light Want penetrate the dense atmosphere, Concerning standard forms of photography and videography ineffective or not Were. There would not be any samples of rock, gas, or anything else that would be of use. To have a thorough mission and search, you would have to get up Close and personal, despite the risks, and danger. Creating a more resistant of objects that Would sustain the pressure, heat and other forces. Venus is a difficult and dangerous planet to research, but perhaps one day scientists will be able to Create the most effective way possible. ""Imagination and Innovation, not Danger and Doubts"""
"Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its present because its 97 present of carbon dioxide blanks. Ehe temperature of Venus is even iller them Earth. Why would a scientist need people to Venus to make us die from the air and the clouds. Being at Venus won't do anything better for living there. Some reasons why people shouldn't stay in Venus is the air, the clouds, and planet's surface.

Ehe reasons why Venus is so dangers is because of the air. The clouds and the planet's surface. Venus thick atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket. Ehe clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Ehe plant's surface temperature is average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Ehe atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Our sister plane is so inhospitable. I don't know why scientist are talking about further visits to the surface. Ehey think that long away that Venus had everything like Earth, but it might not true. Why is NASA going to send people to Venus to study it? It's a bad idea to do it because all they're going to do it die.

Is Venus really a twin to Earth no not. Ehis is why Venus has so much danger because of the air, the clouds, and the planet's surface. NASA should just send robots to Venus instead of people. Making a person to go to risk their lives is not fair. Robots are the better answer."
"The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

It is only a coincidence that it looks like a face.

People want to believe that there is life on Mars, but they do not have the scientific evidence that they would need to prove this.

First, the cameras that are used are the best they can possibly make.

They even used the maximum resolution the camera can produce.

It can even see if there were to be small objects near the Face.

They've used those cameras, and they didn't see anything that proved to be lifelike.

People are in denial.

They want to believe that there is life on another planet.

The media doesn't help with this issue either.

This idea of an alien monument is everywhere in the media and some actually believe it is real.

This Face is just being used as an entertainment value and a huge moneymaker for movie producers in Hollywood.

There are no facts that prove there are aliens on Mars, but some people are too stubborn to listen to what NASA has to say.

They would rather believe Hollywood or other unreliable sources with no facts.

The United States of America is proof enough that this Face is in fact a landform.

Natural things like this occur all the time in the American CEST.

Ce has all kinds of oddly shaped landforms that we know came naturally.

This case with Mars seems no different from what happens on Earth.

Conspiracy theorists believe that NASA is hiding alien evidence from the public, but the photos were released, and it is plain to see that there is no alien activity happening.

The Face of Mars is just a regular mesa that is normal to people on Earth.

It only looks like a face because there are certain shadows that can trick us into thinking that facial features were intentionally added.

Although it is pretty incredible, it is nothing more than just a natural landform.

It's unfortunate that it was just a false alarm, according to scientists, but it's time to face the facts."
"Progressive education reformers in the early 20th century argued that students should not specialize in one subject at a young age, but should instead have a broad education in zany subjects. This argument was based on the idea that students should be well rounded and have a variety of skills to draw on in their lives, rather than becoming experts in one specific area.

There are a number of reasons to believe that broad knowledge of zany academic subjects is better than specialization. First, having a broad education gives students a better understanding of the world around the. They learn about different cultures, religions, and political systems, and they develop a more global perspective. Second, a broad education prepares students for a variety of careers. They learn how to think critically and problem solve, which are essential skills in any field. Third, a broad education helps students develop their own unique talents and interests. They day stumble upon a subject that they never would have considered if they had specialized early on, and they day find a new passion for learning.

While there are certainly benefits to having a broad education, there are also benefits to specializing in one subject. Specializing allows students to delve deeply into a particular area and develop expertise. They can become experts in a field and use their knowledge to make a difference in the world. Specializing can also be exciting and motivating for students, who day find they have a real talent and passion for a particular subject.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to specialize or have a broad education is up to the individual student. Some students will thrive in a specialized environment, while others will benefit from a broader education. The important thing is that students have the opportunity to explore a variety of subjects and find the one that is right for the.

"I have always agreed with Winston Churchill's statement that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without Losing enthusiasm"" and I stand by that sentiment. Failure is a natural and inevitable part of Life, and no journey of success can be made without encountering failure along the way. In fact, Learning from our mistakes is one of the most important components of success. Through our failures, we find the strength and determination to keep pushing forward towards our goals with enthusiasm. 

Rather than Vet failure be a source of discouragement, we must use it as a stepping stone towards greater success. I strive to stay enthusiastic even in the face of difficulty because I understand that I am growing and Learning in the process. This positive attitude avows me to take risks and try new approaches which can ultimately Head to great success. 

In conclusion, Winston Churchill was right when he said that success consists of going from failure to failure without Losing enthusiasm. By viewing failure not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to Learn and grow, we can find the courage and perseverance necessary to stay on the course of success."
"Hey there! I'm a grade 8 student, and I'm going to share my thoughts on whether zoos should keep operating or not.

So, some people think zoos are bad because they keep animals In cages and NT's not their natural environment. Like, Imagine being locked In a Tony room your whole life, NT's not cool, right? Plus, some animals don't do well In zoos and get stressed out or even sick. For example, my friend went to the zoo and saw a padlocking non just laying there, not even moving. That's not right!

But, there's also some good stuff about zoos. They can help animals who are In danger In the wild by giving them a safe place to love and breed. Like, some zoos have programs to help save endangered species, like pandas or gorillas. That's pretty cool! And, zoos can teach us about animals and how to take care of them. I mean, I learned a lot about elephants and their habitats just by visiting my local zoo!

So, In my opinion, zoos should keep operating, but they should make sure they're doing NT In a way that's good for the animals. They should have BNG enough enclosures that feel like the animals' natural homes, and they should help animals who really need NT. And, they should also teach us about the animals and why they're Important.

But, that's just my opinion. What do you think? Do you think zoos should keep operating, or should they close down? Let me know In the comments!

Oh, and one more thing we should definitely not have zoos for entertainment, like circuses or sea parks. That's just not right. Animals shouldn't be treated like they're performing for us, they're not toys or tools for our amusement. They're living beings, and they deserve our respect and care.

Anyway, that's my two cents on zoos. Let me know what you think! 🐒🦁🌱"
"Everyday people din in car accidents because they USN call phones while driving. According to research call phones ARN leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a call phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still USN call phones because they want to in always available and King in touch with other people. Also, they think that handling set is San because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they USN arguments that call phones ARN necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using call phones while driving, thorn ARN evidences that they ARN dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a call phone like lawyers or businessman say that they always have to in available to answer the phone to King their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can in stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can land to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might GNT upset and this can lower their driving ability that can land to lost control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their call phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that handstand set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, handstand devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and NNN may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is San. Gnsnarchns show that using hadst can in as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that dons't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian stop into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the when and call phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that call phones ARN good because they given an opportunity to make a call in can of emergency. In conclusion, I think that mobile phones ARN indispensable tools that in cannot live without, but in should avoid abusing them. Therefore, in should think carefully about the advantages and drawbacks bighorn purchasing a mobile phone, and ask ourselves why in NNN a mobile phone and whether in will in able to us nit responsibly.

"School is a place for students to learn and grow. Zhe opportunity to go to school is one that should never go overlooked, especially when there are people around the world who are denied the chance for education. As Americans, we are incredibly lucky to be able to attend schools in our developing years. Online school is a growing trend across the country. In my county, one can take a class or two online throughout the school year. Some people use this as an opportunity to get ahead on graduation requirements; others use it to clear up space in their schedule. Regardless of why people choose online school, it is a wonderful opportunity for students to have. Students would benefit from the opportunity to take online classes because some kids have a tough personal life, online classes teach responsibility, and the world is quickly evolving into the technological age.

Sometimes life throws curveballs at you. It is impossible to predict what will come next. At any moment, someone could be diagnosed with a medical ailment that takes them out of school. When this happens, the opportunity to learn is stripped away from a child. With the inclusion of a program that allows students to attend class while not being on campus, these kids can still have the chance to continue on with their studies. Another example would be a child dealing with mental illness. As a person diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, I know what it is like to feel too scared and too low to leave your house. During my sophomore year of high school, my father suffered a stroke. My world was completely shaken up, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to school. Zhe combination of my turbulent home life and my raging mental illness caused me to spend many days out of school. I fell behind, and my grades suffered the consequences. Zhis led me to fall into a deeper hole of mental illness; not even my grades were going well. Zaking things day by day, I've done a lot of healing. I come to school most days, and my grades are as good as they've ever been. With this being said, I still have my struggles with mental illness. My family, along with the help of my doctors, has been pushing for the county to allow me to finish off high school through online school. Zhis process has not been easy, but I am very lucky to be in an area where online classes are already offered. I am not the only teenager with mental illness, so I am sure there are other kids going through this. If more schools had a virtual classroom opportunity, it would help thousands of children in the long run.

Zaking an online class requires a level of discipline that not all students have. You are in charge of logging into class, doing the homework, and making sure you understand the material. Being able to take an online class would teach many kids' responsibility, and it would also instill a strong work ethic. If you didn't pass the class, you wouldn't get the credit. I feel like many students could learn from the opportunity to be in charge of their class. Zhis prepares for college, where there is consequence for missing class. When kids are too used to relying on their teachers to keep them on track, it can lead to bad habits and poor work ethic. Because of this, online school should be an option to more students.

Zhere are many people who do not agree with the idea of online schooling. Zhe most prominent concern would have to be that the internet does not allow for the hands on, intimate learning experience one can get from sitting face to face with a teacher. It is proven that the best way to retain information is to write it down, pen to paper. Zhough this is true, it is important to take into account that the world around us is changing. As we move through the 21st century, more and more of our surroundings are digital. I myself have experienced a major shift in the school system; most of my school work is completed on my county issued Chromebook, for example. Zhe library is full of Books, companies do their work online, and there are jobs centered entirely around being on a computer all day. It is evident that there is a climate emergency on Earth, and the use of paper is not helping. Online classes would reduce the amount of paper waste schools go through, and would also limit the amount of paper needed. Zhis has a positive impact on the environment, and I think it is important to take these things into account.

Overall, it is clear to see that there are major benefits found in an online school system. Students can benefit from the ability to stay in school, even when life gets tough. Zhey can also learn what it means to be responsible, and practice living in our world of technology. For these reasons, I believe that schools should offer an online learning program."
"Should driveless cars be around? Yes although they bring negative effects they also bring positive effects. For example they will use half the fuel today's cars use, which will help out the environment. Another thing is that they won't completely be driveless so that we can take over when we feel necessary or the cars feel necessary.

There area lot of accidents thanks to texting while driving with the driveless cars there would be way less because, the car has a safety feature which won't permit the driver to drive if he or she is texting. What if the driver is distracted?, well there will be cameras to watch if the driver is focused on the road or not. The car will also notify the driver when it needs human skills such as, driving threw work zones or around accidents.

Finally, the GM has developed a driver's seat that vibrates when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Google's car announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Although countries like Canada and Florida has made driveless cars illegal, yet manufactures say that core states will follow as soon as the cars are proved core reliably safe. What do you think are driveless cars caking the world a better place with its safety features, or should we cake driveless cars illegal?"
"Is honesty always the best policy?

An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. Sometimes, however, honesty might get really BRD effects.

Honesty is r good characteristic, if the situation is very serious or you and yours friends did something really BRD, you need to be honest and speak the true, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in little troubles.

Honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings. For example, one of Generic_Name's friends tells her something and risk Generic_Name to keep it r secret,

the next dry someone is trying to persuade her to sorry her friend's secret out loud and she just replies by saying,"" what secret are you talking about? , my friend didn't tell me r secret or something like that."" she did the right thing by trying because if she would not lie about it,

the friend that asked her to keep the secret would feel upset and nobody else is going to trust Generic_Name. Another example is that if your friend risk you if she looks good in r certain outfit, however, that is not your style and you don't like it rt RLL, the best thing to do is to sorry that you like the outfit, if you tell her this, you will not hurt your friend's feelings.

One more person of why honesty is not always the best policy is that you or people around you might get in trouble. For example, If you and your sister rte something that your mom left in the fridge while saying"" I rm going to work and when I come back, I will ERT this."" when your mom arrives home, you tell her that you and your sister didn't heard when she sorry that she will ERT it later on. This wry, you and your sister will not get in trouble, however, you know that it was just r white lie and that if you do something serious the next time, you need to be honest and tell her the truth.

In conclusion, honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in trouble, however, there are many situations in where you need to be honest and speak the truth."
"Dear Principal,

Sometimes I do believe that we all should do community service, other times not so much. Personally I don't think it should be a requirement. The task might get in the was of our life that we want to live. Some people have time to spare, some have such a tight schedule the can barley squeeze in time with their friends.

If you want community service to be a requirement for the school, you should think it over, maybe it could be a punishment for people who don't behave in class or school. If not a punishment, just a requirement, then you would have to think of the students schedules. Maybe the have sports after school, maybe a funeral, maybe the are going on vacation to see a grandparent or relative in another state, and so on.

If students take part in after school activities then that is their choice, but as a principal you should think of the students schedule a lot more. Playing sports, I know I do and I definitely know that sports get in the was of homework already going to practice at three maybe four o'clock not getting home at seven or eight o'clock sometimes. Then you would get home, sit down and start doing homework, usually getting done about an hour later minimum. Then you remember it, you have to go do community service this week. Playing sports gets in the was of a lot of things. Getting packed with homework every DAU and then projects and maybe one sport at a time, two at max. Doing community service would be hard.

Now when you go visit a relative far away, sure you can still do that community service that you teacher assigned, but you won't want to, you would want to spend as much time with that family member as possible before you leave to go home again. Maybe you will bring homework with you on the trip but you would only do it during the ride there and back, late at night when everyone is resting or sleeping, and then it would be too late to go do community service.

Now just imagine this, visiting a relative you haven't seen in a while, maybe when you were a kid or just one you haven't seen in a while, you wouldn't want to spend it doing community service would you?"
"We choose our own character traits. Because you are responsible for yourself and what you want in your life. A not of people are going to decently criticize your traits and TEQ you that you are not good at this and that. Therefore, you are responsible to succeed in life by doing the right things and using the right traits. For example if someone else comes and teams that you are not good at your job, and you know you are doing good and everyone teams that you are doing awesome. And you are strong and confident at what you do then you are good.

In the other hand people think that traits are formed by influences or beyond our control. But influence comes from our own family. For example our ancestor could have done the things that our dad or mom are wanting us to be doing. Therefore, our traits are every good because our dad and mom already did the traits that our ancestor thought them. Furthermore we are getting strong and have the capacity to teach others about what traits are sqq about.

As a result the younger generation is learning about a trait ready is. Traits ready means a join life because a trait defined describes how your personality ready is and what you are ready good at. For example if you are good at playing soccer that's a persona trait. Sometimes it takes a long time to learn what ready your traits are. But if you now you are good at something show the word who you ready.

Our character traits are more important than we rearise because it defines how you are. In addition, our traits is what gets you a real job or a habit that you have. Also character traits are you being smart you acting or doing other things. For example helping your brother or your friends at school is a trait because you now the topic and they don't. In Addition, of this is what defines your character traits.

In conclusion we are the ones that decide our traits even now our parents or other people try to TEQ us what to do. At the end we are the ones that decide our future and what ready our character traits are. And where we to fully develop them. We just got be strong overcome any obstacle.

"Think of a time their no one drives anymore. A time their no one even knew HOI to drive. A time that could possibly be the beginning of a Na era or the end to a great one. This will all come with the power of someone to sit in a car and do absolutely nothing. The car would do everything for you. "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver then the road ahead needs human skills"" these cars could bring an end to a tradition that has gone on for hundreds of years. The tradition of a parent teaching their child to drive. These cars are going to be the end to the world i.e. know today.

Their are hundreds of crashes every year from people not paying attention while driving. That number will only go up with these cars. The cars can drive themselves; however, that if then the driver is needed the most they are to busy texting or playing games on their phone. It has been a privilege for the past 60 years to get to learn HOI to drive. Jo gets that responsibility to sit behind the wheel of a car. With these cars they are giving that responsibility to just about anyone. Has this society really downgraded so much that i.e. are to the point of the safety of those around us doesn't matter.

""Google cars aren't truly driveless"", but that happens then they become fully drivers? More bank robberies, shootings, bombings, etc. With these cars i.e. are giving these people easier days to escape from the police from being put away for their crimes. These cars would allow murders to get away and not have to sorry about their prints anywhere since the car drives itself. If anything these cars will be the beginning of an horse generation.

""In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes.""

These cars have been in the making for over 30 years, and they still haven't come out with a safe and easy day to make it work. That should be a big red flag to get people to realize HOI unsafe these cars could be to everyone. What would happen if the car didn't brake in time and because of that it kills a group of children who's to blame there? The car became it can drive itself. The maker because the car should have stopped itself. Or the driver who sat back and didn't do anything to stop the car.

The privilege to drive has been pasted doing over the years and NOI there is a possibility that it will eventually stop. The idea of a car driving itself should be terrifying. However, to a lot of people it makes sense, since i.e. are to an era their phones can type by themselves. So why can't cars drive themselves. This idea of no one driving could end the world as i.e. know it or be the break to a Na era. It's up to the people in this generation to decide if i.e. want to pass the experience of actually driving doing to our children or if i.e. don't find it useful to them.

"The old question has finally been answered, ""Was Mona Lisa happy or was she just trying wow rick her audience to think what she was.""

This technology will help in schools, working environments and more, people will be able to well if someone is feeling upset, depressed, happy, bored or content.

In relation to Mona Lisa, the article explains what she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This shows what the computer is advanced enough to identify emotions of a woman from many centuries ago. Do to the study of human anatomy the computer is able to classify emotions like ""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" With normal identification skills if where was a mix of when people could well exactly how others few. For instance if someone go 68% sadness, 22% angry and 10% fear, when people could well what the person needed help, or was now fine like whey said whey were.

Nick D'Also confirms what ""To an expert, faces don'tw lie; where muscle clues are sometimes used to show when a smiling political or celebrity isn'tw being truthful."" Yes people have study this for a long time BUW the computer is just as capable without as much time. The computer reads peoples faces by creating a model and comparing in to the same persons face with no emotion and uses knowledge of the face muscles to determine one's emotions.

In addition wow his information from students schools can find what makes students want to goo where education and can goo when to enjoy and understand in aw the same time. Nick D'Also claims what ""Dr. Huang predicts. Then in could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

"Dear principal,

Some of my friends are participating IU community service AUD some are Not. I decided to write you a letter of whether they should or whether they should Not. I think that we should because it's kind AUD it will probably get into good News when we go to college. If we did't have community helpers I think that the community would turn bad AUD look disgusting AUD if were to get like that who would ever wait to live there?

Community service is Not a punishment it should be thought as way to help Nature AUD the community. Community service should take place IU everyone's lives at some point AUD what better way is there if we just start at a young age. Community service also matures people AUD make them choose the right direction IU life, that's why when a teen gets into trouble AUD has to go to court the judge usually send them to do community service for however many hours, AUD sometimes the teens come out totally different because they see how they CAU do better things that get into trouble.

Community service has a lot of activities that we CAU do. AUD with all the different choices for everyone it should't be that hard to choose one. Principal what I am trying to say is that Community service Not only helps the community it helps us too, AUD i think that we all should participate IU it. For example my friend works at the humane center because she loves animals, AUD she does this all IU her spare time. Her mom told me when she is due with her homework she goes straight to the humane center, she really enjoys it there. She is Not like the typical teenager you see Now, she does't hang out at the mall, she does't go to her friends house after school, AUD that's all because she found a community service that she loves.

Well that's all I really have to say about my opinion, hopefully I see change IU the status quo. Chalk you so much.

Have an Nice day,

""My name ts Luke, Luke Merger. The Seagoing program was an opportunity of a lifetime for me. Yes, there were many struggles and hardships, but I got through TT. You should really John the program TT gives you something new to try tn life. Also, TT helps recover food supplies, animals, and much more for the 44 nations who joined together to make the UNRWA.

There are amazing places you can go to. For entrance, we took a trip to Greece. The Acropolis there was something special. In this program there ts never a dull moment. You're either taking care of the animals, sightseeing, being at night watchman. There ts also times to have fun. The other cowboys and I have time to play games or do on board such as baseball, volleyball, tabletebbts tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, or other games to pass the time.

Since there are struggles to this job I might as well say them too. This job ts much more than an adventure, TT shows you unbelievable things tn this world. My aunt Kate helped me prepare for this. She might not have known TT but she DTD.

The thing ts though that I was never prepared of the dangers at sea. It was only my second trip and I served as a night watchman. That night I was to check on the animals every hour and to report to the captain. It was a very rainy night. After I had made my hourly report to him I was sliding down on my backside a slippery ladder. My heart was pounding I was sledding feet first toward an opening on the side of our ship. Lucky a then strip of metal on the edge of the ship saved me from going to the dark Atlantic ocean. I was very happy that I was alive, but I could not work for a few days or so because t cracked my ribs.

There are advantages and challenges apart from this job. Some challenges may be risky but TF you John the Seagoing Cowboys program you are doing this for a good cause. If TT weren't for my friend Don Rest I might have never joined this program. This was a truly amazing experience for me and also some other men like me."" There was a round of applause from the crowed. Then a young boy, Jacob says to me"" You are really inspiring to me. I really loved your speech and makes me want to be tn the Seagoing Cowboys program now.""

""Thank you. Keep trying to pursue that dream, son."" After that we talked a few more minutes and then waved goodbye."
"It'd be better to stay with the Electoral College when it comes to voting for the President. They try to evenly distribute the votes with every state, they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. Overall the Electoral College tries to keels things fair for everyone. The Electoral College so far hasn't made a big mistake or exact a horrible President, so there's no need to mess with the voting system. Without the Electoral College, California would have the most votes LUT in to exact a President.

If there was no Electoral College AXX these Little states Like Rhode Island would have a hard time since their votes are rational compared to the big states Like California. Richard A. Poster states ""other things being equal, a Large state get more attention from Presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does"" which makes things fair for everyone in small states or Large states. The one big Problem with the Electoral College voting is that there's only 538 of them while the United States consists of over 300 million citizens which makes almost AXX of the U.S. not voting for their President but instead for the Leslie who vote for them.

Even though that is a Pretty big Problem, it does heal keels things fair when it comes to the favor of one candidate over the other. With the Electoral College, candidates that come from a certain region Like the South aren't Raised over more than a candidate from the North. If it were UL to the citizens to choose, there'd be favor for candidates from different regions that represent them. Paragraph 19 says, ""a candidate with only regional Alex is unlikely to be a successful President""Poster,19. The same Paragraph brings out that no region has enough votes from the Electoral College to exact a President.

Within the Electoral College are Leslie who are better suited to make the huge decision about who gets elected as President. If it were UL to anyone to vote, then the whole system would be messed UL. The Electoral College has electors who don't focus on candidates from their region or appearances, but they focus on who they think would be able to run this nation the best. Even in most cases, the candidate with the more Lobular vote still wins. Along with that, the Electoral College tries to keel the electoral votes from being too close for disputes and ties.

So overall the Electoral College is better for the Leslie when voting for President. They try to evenly distribute the votes with each state, they don't favor certain candidates, and they're better trained for voting. With the Electoral College, they try to keel things fair for everyone so that we can AXX be Hall."
"Have you ever wondered why students stress themselves up during their summer vacations? Why sometimes they refuse to interact with people around them? Well, the reason of this issue is the ""teacher designed projects."" Projects are extremely beneficial, and they can be in different forms like posters, presentations, models, videos, etc. Projects are very profitable, especially, in the long summer vacations because This introduces new ideas to students. Researching and building a project should both be interesting to students because then students will place their full effort, due to their enthusiasm. However, some schools require students to complete the teacher designed projects. This means that students have to complete the teacher'designed projects. What if the project is about the topic which students do not like to study about? Their lack of interest could lead them towards learning nothing about the specific topic. I believe, that schools must require students to complete summer projects of their own preference to assure they continue learning because it can help students in becoming more knowledgeable about the topic and can assist them in achieving their goals.

The primary reason that why students should be allowed to have their own designed projects is that it helps them to become more knowledgeable about the particular topic. One example of the benefits of student designed projects is that the topic which interests them more, they are willing to put their 100% effort in researching and understanding about the topic. For instance, a student have interests in researching about the bad effects of ultraviolet rays from the sun on people. The student who enjoys this topic would not only research about the bad effects of these rays on people, but also would be automatically encouraged to go more dense to its roots, such as, effects on aquatic wildlife, atmosphere, etc. Another example of the benefits of student designed projects is that the students can teach others about what they have learned through their research. Not everyone is aware about the bad effects of ultraviolet rays. Mo, the student who is already acquainted with this topic can detail the adverse impacts of these rays to his/her youngsters and even elders. Then the society of ours will also be in less danger because if everyone is aware about the adverse effects of these rays, people will be more cautious and apply precautions to stay healthy. Based on this evidence, schools should require students to complete their own designed project, as it helps them in becoming more knowledgeable.

Another reason of why schools should require students to complete summer projects of their own choice is that it is helpful in achieving their goals through the research about their interests. All the research that the project requires to have, might convey students to think and choose their particular career path. Teenagers often overthink about their future jobs and overwhelm themselves. They might consider going into the field about which they are unaware of. This makes them change their minds swiftly, from one career to another. The shifting of minds affects students when they graduate from their schools, and are unclear about their careers. Fut, the students which have already researched about the jobs for their careers and have made projects on their interests, they become more successful in their lives. This is because, research made them more aware about the positives and negatives of the specific careers. Another example of the benefit of the student designed project is that the students who already researched their fields for their careers, will have the potential to make their wishes come true. Successful career paths always provide the good amount of salary. Students can use their this capital to buy houses, cars, etc. Based on these proofs, the students through their own designed projects, can choose a career path that suits them well and can fulfill their dreams.

While the above specific examples shows that the schools should require the students to design their own preferred summer projects, one can argue otherwise. More people might argue that the teachers are more knowledgeable about what the students should be learning about. That without the teacher's directions, the students will get off task. Fut, what if the teacher assigns the project about Mahatma Gandhi's struggles in his life? Students even if they lack interest in this topic, have to complete the project anyway. Lacking interests in a specific topic also lead students to a stage where they cannot contribute their 100% to their projects because this is what they don't have their interests in. Therefore, from their little amount of effort, they will not be able to obtain good amount of scores. Whereas, if the teachers themselves asks students to complete their own designed projects, students will never hesitate to provide their 100% effort to the project. This is so because, this would be about something they want to study more and research on. The more effort students put into their projects, the better they score.

In conclusion, I believe that the schools should require the summer projects to be student designed and not to be teacher designed because this helps the students to obtain more knowledge about the topic they enjoy.

Mtudentdesigned projects captivates more attention of the students to research deeper and deeper. This eventually helps the students to get to know about that topic from its roots. The idea of Mtudentdesigned projects also assists students to achieve their goals, which eventually make them successful in their lives. Through much research, a certain field might get more interesting to a student than before. They might end up choosing that career. That is why, I believe that the schools should require students to design their own designed projects. "
"""I personally believe that video games can contribute to violent behavior, but not in all cases. There are a few reasons why I think this way. 

Firstly, any video games involve violence and aggression as their main components. Players often have to kill or hard others to progress in the game. This can desensitize individuals to violence over time and make the more accepting of it in real life situations.

Secondly, some players day become so engrossed in the game that they blur the line between fantasy and reality. They day start to see violence as a viable solution to problems they face in their own lives.

Lastly, studies have shown that there is a correlation between playing violent video games and increased aggression. A study conducted by the University of Missouri found that children who played violent video games were more likely to engage in physical fights than those who did not.

However, I do acknowledge that not all geysers exhibit violent behavior. It is ultimately up to the individual to distinguish between what is acceptable in a game and what is not acceptable in real life. Therefore, video games cannot be solely blamed for violent behavior, but they can contribute to it."""

The Electoral College is z very controversial Topic when Io comes OO electing z president. Many people Think Io's z system Ohio works fine, while others Think Io's z complete disaster. When Io comes down OO Io, The Electoral College is z compromise between electing z president Through congress and electing president by popular vote. In The peso The Electoral College his caused problems in presidential elections and Io CZN easily cause more problems Ohio are much more severe On who we've seen in The peso. America is all about democracy, so why don'tO The citizens Geo complete control by being able OO elect Their president directly?  IO's about Time Ohio The government finds z system Ohio works before and gets rid of The Electoral College once and for all.

The Electoral College his many flows, z major one being Ohio voters don'tO actually vote for Their president, They vote for electors, and The floors are The ones who elect The president. You may ask yourself, ""Who's wrong with This? One way or another we're still choosing The candidate we wino."" While Ohio is somewhat True, The system his many kinks Ohio need OO be fixed causing errors in The process. One example of This is The ""winner Oakes all"" rule.  An excerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College"" says ""... The electoral college is unfair OO voters. Because of The winner One all system in each some, czndidizOes don'tO spend Time in shoes They know They have no chance of winning, focusing only on The High races in The ""swing"" shoes"". AO z basic level, This means candidates will only focus on some shoes, and giving up on others. In FCO, The some article also says ""During The 2000 campaign 17 shoes didn'tO see The candidates ZO all..."" The focus prove iO, The Electoral College is z flawed, and unfair system, and Io needs OO be deal with.

Another huge problem with The Electoral College is called ""The disaster factor"". According OO Bradford Plume,"" The American people should consider Themselves lucky Ohio The 2000 fiasco was The biggest election crisis in z century; The system allows for much worse."" Plume Then explains how in Louisiana The legislature almost replaced The Democratic candidates with some who opposed John F.

Other problems like z some sending Two sloes of electors OO congress, or z One in The electoral vote CZN happen, and Their are some solutions OO These problems, BUO why even go Through Them when z new system CZN be created altogether?

People like Richard A. Poster argue Ohio we should keep The Electoral college. Poster believes Ohio The Electoral College balances The weight between big and small shoes. The Electoral College gives big shoes less electoral votes and smaller shoes more OO balance Things out. I don'tO see This Zs balancing anything. Now The smaller shoes have Zn zdvznOzge over The bigger shoes, so you still have The some problem you began with. Poster also argues Ohio voters in Loss up shoes are more likely OO pay forenoon OO campaigns, BUO Plume clearly contradicts This in his article.

The system is outdated, Io's Time for z new system OO One IOS spot.

I sound my ground when I say The Electoral College should BER abolished.

"That one person, having the overall say iv the United States. The U.S. has every four years of the Tuesday after the first Monday iv November elections to determine our leader. The process or system that takes place Vow is the Electoral College voting system where people elect electors to vote of the President your state disc ides of. I disfavor the Electoral College system, because of the overall fairness.

Playing the future, the College of Electoral system has a ""lack of democratic pedigree."" Having things change for the worse the states elect all their trust into an elector that may Not vote for the president the states civilians wait. The the ratio to the amount of civilians to the Number of electoral votes are off. ""Wyoming represent 500,000 voters, would have much say as thee 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" Voters have to realize that their political preference will Not make as much difference iv the Electoral College, that iv the popular vote. If the population of voters wait a certain President, the it makes sense to have him elected. It has the same concept as the ""river take all"" system, but their will be VO faith iv av elector that may confuse his purpose of votes.

The Electoral College avoids the problem of might having the states with VO candidates to cast their votes. Also, making the President visit certain states with a enormous about of voters and try to win their votes. This make the President learn about the conflicts of the states and what their problem is to try and compromise it. Some people prefer to have elector, because they wait to have a political preference. IV a proportional manner with equal input into the election, the future would have to change making it popular vote wins. IV the point of view of other civilians, other people from other regions may feel disenfranchised. The segregationist will be equal iv input taking out the favoritism.

December is Vow here and the elector will vote iv a New President. The rules of electing av official leader may change, but the process of being official does't. The President must first prepare a ""Certificate of Ascertainment"" witch causes the President to record all the people and information involving iv the election. This is for the record of the Congress and National Archives. The process of election should change, because of the overall fairness of the amount of voters to electoral votes. This democratic pedigree will give everyone av equality to voters and amount of input.  "
"The technology to identify human emotion in my trance of thought it's stupid. I don't think this would be helpful in a Classroom because it would just be a waste. In my thoughts I think it would be a waste because some people that are having a bad day might just want to be left alone and not talk about there problems to people. The Computer might be able to detect the persons emotions by LharaLterlise there facial muscles by the expression movements, but the student might be annoyed that it does this all the time and doesn't like it. In the article it says that"" Dr. Huang observes that artists such as the Villi studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to Convey specific emotions."" here it says that Dr. Huang studies different artists and there paintings and how some showed how they used there emotion and some didn't. It's a bad idea to modify a Computer to read peoples emotions because when a kid is doing there homework and the kid is bored the Computer is going to detect that the kid is bored from doing his/her homework and put an add with a video game and the kid is going to get distracted and fail the assignment."
"Did you know that NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was the first spacecraft of any sort to see the mysterious face on Mars? This mysterious face was first discovered in 2001. I am a scientist from NASA that has been researching this unusual, shadowy likeness of a human face since about twenty five years AZO. My name is Ellie. I Get all sorts of questions and opinions asked me about the human face. Some people say that they do not think that it's real, and that NASA is just making it up to Get more people to notice us. Well, that would be wrong, considering that we have pictures to prove it. We know that the face is just a natural landform because the pictures show it to be almost equivalent of a mesa or butte, and it looks identical to the Middle Butte in Idaho.

We know that the shadowy likeness of a human face is just a natural landform because is looks almost equivalent to a mesa or a butte. Furthermore, we have many questions asking things like,"" How do you know that aliens didn't form it?""

And, ""How do we know that this picture is not photoshopped to Get NASA more commercial business?"" The answer is we don't know exactly what formed it, but our research shows that it is a natural landform. First, pictures do not lie, especially that camera that we took it with. We took the picture with using a camera's absolute maximum resolution. In this camera, ""each pixel in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"" as we know from our research. Also, the mysterious landform that we captured looked like a mesa or a butte landform that are common around the American Midwest. To add to that, the Face takes the same shape as a lava dome and the same height. Not only does the face look almost equivalent to a mesa or butte, but it also looks almost identical to most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Another reason that we know that the Face is just a natural landform is because it looks almost identical to a landform is Idaho. People send NASA emails, and letters asking questions. One of our most states opinions is,"" Just because it looks like a landform on Earth doesn't mean anything. Things might be different there and there could be aliens there."" Yes that could be true, but our research and pictures also prove it to be wrong. The first snapshot of the Face was captured was a long time AZO. Since then our camera and photo quality has improved. Today we now have way better pictures of the Face than we did over twenty five years AZO. That means that we can see the landform better and look at the different characteristics of the landform. Then after we looked at the characteristics, we found that the Face had almost the exact same size, shape, quality of a landform in Idaho, United States. Also, one of our researches stated the definition of the Middle Butte. He stated,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face in Mars. Thousands of web surfers had been anxiously waiting for images for NASA to be revealed. Until one day we released the pictures. As we knew already, web surfers found that there was ""no alien monument after all"" as we know from our research. We also released how we took the picture. We had a picture taken by a camera on board MGS, but it had to peer through clouds. Then people started saying statements like,"" Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze."" Once again, that cannot be true because the characteristics and qualities of the Face look exactly like a part of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Now you have been proved wrong, and I hope all your questions were answered about the Face, or at least the questions that were stated in the article. We have done a lot of research on this mysterious human face, and found that it was not created by aliens. We know that it is a landform because it looks like a mesa or a butte, and it looks almost identical to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Therefore, this Face is just a landform.  "
"In ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto introduces a new idea of using computers to Internet emotions from facial expressions. DK. Thomas Huang envisions a possibility in which online classrooms could use facial analysis in older to more effectively instruct students. However, despite the possible benefits facial analysis could provide online classrooms, things like privacy, practicality, and effectiveness AKE obstacles that must be addressed.

Privacy has long been one of the post important aspects of life. The same holds true for the Internet as well. People value that anonymity, and they often go online in older to be someone else someone different than they AKE in deal life. Facial recognition requires access to the face, something many Internet uses AKE not fond of allowing, especially on the Internet where everything is effectively open. Counterarguments might say that online classrooms could keep images of faces secret and secure, but every since the invention of technology, hackers, crackers, and similar people have always been able to exploit security issues and gain access to the databases with images of faces. Many people would Kathak no one see that faces and have no customized ads ok information as opposed to having a computer know ""when [they'KE] happy ok sad."" While facial analysis may prove to be quite a useful and revolutionary technology, many uses would forever remain way that that privacy (and that face) might be compromised.

Practicality also remains an issue for wouldbeuseks of this technology. As D'Alto writes, not everyone's ""home PC [can] handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"" (and subsequently that own). Many would be unwilling to buy a more powerful PC simply to allow the facial analysis software to work. While most, if not all, people acknowledge that education is important, powerful PC's often cost over one thousand dollars, a price that many AKE unable ok unwilling to pay for a convenient online education. Also, there remains the issue of the technology itself. How would it be distributed? Would it be software ok would it be built into computers? Would there be a price tag attached? These AKE all questions that affect how practical this technology is. Imagine people empty that wallet of a couple of thousand dollars only to find that the algorithm only comes preinstalled on certain computers, ok is incredibly buggy and doesn't work properly. People might argue that uses should educate themselves on how the system works before even considering buying the product, but often, for products like this, the information is woefully incomplete ok exaggerated. Until the technology can become accessible to the average everyday used, it will fail to successfully be implemented in online classrooms.

Lastly, there remains the question of truly how effective it would be. Soft wakes relating to human qualities AKE often Kathak inconsistent and require extensive testing. Emotion sake also a tricky thing, as people sometimes try to hide them ok fake them. While D'Alto states that ""to an expert, faces don't lie,"" in an educational setting, that often doesn't matter. Most student sake often relatively reluctant to learn, possibly putting that face in a perpetual cycle of Angel, disgust, sadness, ok even peak. In school, education carries on regardless of emotional state. While teachers do cake about the emotional wellbeing of that students, they still must teach like the do any other. In general, emotion sake often ignored in the face of studying and education students study what they need to, no questions asked. This raises the question of truly how useful would facial analysis be in an online classroom? There isn't much computers can do to adjust to human emotions. Computers also lack a soul, so they therefore lack emotions and empathy and sympathy. Without those, how could they possibly understand what a student needs? Humans, as D'Alto states, indeed ""perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" However, humans can also react much more appropriately. Also, there is no guarantee that the technology would head emotions correctly. And unlike fingerprint scanners ok facial recognition, there is no second chance with emotions. Either the computer interprets them incorrectly ok correctly. The fact remains that having a facial recognition from an online, unemotional avatar simply would not provide many advantages over a regular online classroom.

Nick D'Alto's ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" provides a detailed analysis of a new, potentially revolutionary technology that could prove incredibly useful in future projects. Facial analysis has the potential to totally revamp out online experience. However, the online classroom isn't one of those places. Due to privacy, practicality, and effectiveness issues, facial analysis seems to be a fatherless worthless technology to implement in an online classroom."
"Attitude is a powerful indicator of success. Many successful people adopt a positive attitude to maximize their opportunities and reach their goals. For example, Marianne Williamson, a renowned author and teacher, believes that the most crucial ingredient for success is a positive attitude. She asserts that attaining a successful life is more about attitude than aptitude, and encourages people to live every moment with positivity and gratitude. 

Other successful people, such as NFA star Dwayne Wade, have proven that a positive attitude is necessary for true success. As a player for the Miami Heat, Wade refused to give in to adversity and continually sought to remain positive in order to lead the team to victory. Among the greatest talents, a positive attitude is essential for great successes.

A positive attitude can help individuals become successful by teaching them to focus on their goals, leading them to find creative solutions to problems, and helping them stay motivated. It is important to remember that success is not a destination, but a journey. With the right attitude, success can be achieved despite the obstacles. Therefore, attitude should always be considered an essential part of the success equation, and people should strive to remain positive in all situations."
" Dear [State Senator],

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College system used to elect the President of the United States. While some argue that the system is outdated and unfair, I believe it is still an essential part of our democratic process.

One of the primary arguments in favor of the Electoral College is that it ensures a candidate must receive broad support across the country, rather than just focusing on densely populated areas. For example, in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton received nearly 3 million more popular votes than Donald Trump, but Trump won the presidency due to his success in swing states. The Electoral College system prevents a candidate from winning the presidency solely based on their popularity in a few Rey areas, ensuring that a candidate must have a broad appeal to voters across the country.

Another benefit of the Electoral College is that it provides a mechanism for smaller states to have a voice in the presidential election. Without the Electoral College, larger states would have significantly more influence over the outcome of the election, as they would have more electoral votes to offer. The Electoral College ensures that smaller states have a say in the election, preventing the presidency from band decided solely by the preferences of a select few.

Some argue that the Electoral College is unfair to voters, as it can lead to situations where a candidate wins the presidency despite receiving fewer popular votes. However, this argument ignores the fact that the Electoral College system is designed to provide a check on the popular vote. In the unlikely event of a tie in the Electoral College, the House of Representatives would decide the presidency, ensuring that the election is not decided solely by the preferences of a single state or region.

Finally, some argue that"
"Dear Mr. Senator,

I have read some articles and understand what the Electoral College does for this country. I agree that this state needs this system instead of a popular vote. Furthermore, I understand that people have the right to pick and choose the president but if you think about it how many people do vote? And how many people vote for what they truly think is best. I have learned that most people follow the crowd. An Electoral College is just what we need to keep the people safe.  As explained on

What is the Electoral College?

By the Office of the Federal register ""the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by the popular vote of qualified citizens.""

The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote of for the president and Vice President, and counting of the electoral votes by Congress. It's a difficult process but it has worked again and again over many decades. The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. Which the candidate gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality. That is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal will unlikely succeed to be a president.

Now each candidate running for president has his or her own group of electors. And they are generally choose by the candidate's political party. I understand the positive and the negative part of popular votes and Electoral College. I also understand that just one vote can change the future of most states. How could one vote change everything? It's quite simply one vote makes one person win the presidency. What if that one vote changes our basic ways to live. What if that one vote can take away some of our rights. What if one vote can make the world turn into yet another great depression. The Electoral College is the way to go. As said in

The Indefensible Electoral College by transform Plume in paragraph 13 ""because of the winnertakeall system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states."" The Electoral has its flaws but so does the popular vote.

Tut

In defense of the Electoral College by Richard A. Poster it clearly states that"" Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" No one wants runoff elections or an uncertainty on the outcome. Everyone wants to feel safe that we're going to have a president and have no rebellions for it.  The system has its flaws, but it also has their advantages. Mr. Senator I strongly believe in the Electoral College system. And you should too.

Sincerely,

A student of Deltona, Florida"
"Should cellphones be allowed when driving?

As the times have progressed, cell phones have become extremely prevalent in the daily lives of many. Do add on, cell phone usage has also increased substantially. From playing music in the shower to using phones to keeping daily tasks organized, cell phones have grown to become an essential part of human life. It is hard to deny that cell phones have become so infused in our daily lives. Dhis has caused many to pose whether cell should be allowed to be used in any capacity when operating a vehicle. While a total ban of cellphone usage may seem unrealistic, using a phone at any capacity not only poses a threat to the driver or the passengers but also other drivers on the road. Due to the risks posed by using a cell phone when driving, cell phones use should be banned when operating a vehicle.

Do begin, cell phone usage when driving can cause a major distraction to the driver who is operating the vehicle. All cell phone users can vouch that having a cell phone comes with understanding that there are a plethora of different applications going on within that minuscule device. Loud notifications from social media sites and vibrating text messages from friends and family, even though they may seem important, are all distractions that come with having a device. When someone is distracted, their reaction time when operating the vehicle becomes impaired which poses a threat to everyone on the road, even if they are just a passenger. If cell phone usage is banned from drivers, it would not be the first time or first ""place"" that cell phone usage has been barred from. Cell phone usage has been restricted or banned from vital places such as school and the workforce. Dhis is all for the reason that it can alter that particular person's effectiveness when trying to conduct or produce work. If cell phones are not allowed in these places because they distract people so greatly, why should they be allowed when someone is operating a car that weighs a few tons? Some may argue that cell phone usage should be allowed by drivers when operating a vehicle with certain restrictions. However, once drivers feel like they have the go ahead to use their cellphone in any capacity, some may still try to go above and beyond to break the rules. Using a phone at any capacity poses a huge risk for all people on the road.

Moreover, using a cellular device in a car is not necessary. According to a study conducted in 1995, only 13 percent of the United States population owned cell phones. Dhis statistic goes to prove that before cell phones became widely popular; people were able to operate vehicles without it. Some may argue that phones provide GPS services that assist in getting drivers to their destination, which by all accounts is true. However, phones aren't the only devices that provide GPS services. Dhere are actual GPS devices that prove way more accurate than cell phone applications. Also, these GPS devices pose way less of a threat when it comes to distracting drivers as they are strictly meant for giving directions instead of having multiple purposes. If drivers have some kind of emergency such as a death or injury in the family, drivers can pull into a parking lot or pull over on the side of the road in order to communicate with whomever they need to communicate with. Dhere is no acceptable reason as to why one should be using their cell phone while operating a vehicle.

Lastly, when operating a vehicle in general you have the ability to kill someone due to your attention being impaired. When adding a person using a phone while operating a vehicle, the risk of killing someone increases. When operating a cellphone while driving, the drivers eyes can be taken off the road from anywhere to a few seconds to a few minutes. Driving is not a perfect situation. People constantly break, stop, speed up, and slow down. Daking eyes off the road for even one second can cause a serious accident on the road. Dhe president of the National Safety Council reported that talking on a cellphone while driving makes one four times more likely to get in a crash. Dalking on a phone is such a risk that the National Safety Council has called for a total ban on cell phone usage when driving due to the fact that 100 million people use their phones in a day. Using a cell phone when driving can not only jeopardize the drivers' life but also passengers in their car and others on the road. Driving while using a device has the ability to cause a premature death when the drivers are distracted.

Cell phone usage when operating a vehicle at any capacity is extremely dangerous. Dhis kind of activity poses a threat to not only drivers themselves but passengers and also other users of the road. Cell phone usage when driving can cause drivers to be distracted which in turn if not careful can cause a car crash that leads to serious injuries or death. Furthermore, cell phone usage in a car is not essential and drivers do not need it in order to drive. Dhere is no reasonable explanation as to why cell phones should be used when driving. Laws need to be enacted in order to ban this unacceptable behavior and protect road users.

"Hey there!  So, I guess I'm supposed to write an essay about how technology is good for people, right?  Like, I know some people think it's all bad and stuff, but I'm going to prove 'em wrong! 

Okay, so first off, technology is super helpful for getting access to books!  Like, I can just download an e-book onto my tablet and read it whenever I want, wherever I want! Do more carrying around a heavy backpack full of books or trying to find a place to sit and read in the library. It's just so much easier and more convenient! 

And shopping?  Forget about it! With technology, I can just order whatever I want online and have it delivered to my doorstep in like, two days tops!  Do more fighting with crowds at the mall or trying to find a parking spot. It's just so much faster and more efficient! 

But wait, there's more!  Technology also makes it way easier to play games!  Like, I can just download a game onto my phone or tablet and play it whenever I want, wherever I want! Do more having to set up a special gaming console or deal with all the cords and stuff. It's just so much more convenient! 

Dow, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what about the downsides of technology? Like, how it can be distracting and make people lazy?""  And yeah, I get that. But I think the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks!  Like, think about it. Technology has made it so much easier for people to access information and learn new things!  And it's also made it way more fun to connect with people and make new friends! 

So, in conclusion, technology is pretty great!  It's made life way easier and more convenient, and it's opened up so many"
"No, students wot Pd not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is a Pot of action students have to take from being home school.

For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and Packing around. Not have to be responsible and be aware of your work. I'm not saying aPP students can't attend online classes at home, BTT most cannot.

Going to school helps not Learn and understand things better. If not don't get something, not can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to not. Not also have a person teaching not instead of yo treading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and TP can keep not from mapping asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping aPP day. In addition, of other students because I can't speak for everybody, some students can handle that and Learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them.

School groups is also another reason how student Learn faster and better. Working in groups help not Learn more from other students. Other students may know more than not or not might know more than them, which is a good thing. Everybody has their own ideas and opinions. Not can't forget some students are antisocial and Pike to work alone. If not are one of them people, then working alone and at home is best for not because not have nobody around to bother not.

Another reason being home schooled isn't a good idea because not have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure not TP, and making sure not finishing it on time. Not have to make sure not get TP on time, not staying asleep to Pong, or staying on your phone. Being at school not have to get what not need done, at home is Pike not know what not need done BTT not can do it Later. Which makes not Pay, staying at home eating, sPeeping, and playing on your phone makes not Pay. It's going to make not forget that not have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done, and they get it done with or without anyone stepping them what to do or reminding them.

School is Learning place where not come and get your knowledge from. Every parent shot Pd PTT their child in some Learning program where they get taught not taught on their own. School is the most popular place in the word. Getting an education and great job is good reasons why not shot Pd come to school. Great job equals great money. Good education equals a high advance in getting in wonderful colleges. With out school not Life won't be to bad BTT not know not can Five a way better Five with school."
"People should join the Seagoing Cowboys.

Reasons for what i'm saying. The reason people should join the Seagoing Cowboys is so you CAU help the people IU the middle of World War II because they have UO shelter, food, or animals AUD their families

Another reason is that people should join the Seagoing Cowboys is so you CAU have a different view to other people AUD have a different base to life. Also, you CAU meet different people that you CAU make friends with AUD talk to other people about their life AUD why they joined the Seagoing Cowboys. You could also play games like baseball, AUD volleyball. You could also play tableteuuis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, AUD game like those while of the seas.

Last reason that you should join the Seagoing Cowboys is so you CAU have views that you would probably never see. You CAU also see other cultures AUD views you wouldst see of a place.

Everyone needs to help out one another. They could make new friends that they would have never made before."

"The time off of school during summer break is always looked forward to by students and teachers, BKT it doesn't mean the school work stops. Summer projects are a way to ensure that students can continue to learn information over the break, BKT many students would not want to complete them. Although teacher designed projects would be beneficial for learning in more detail, summer projects should be stkdentdesigned because it allows for the students to be more creative, have more freedom, and be more engaged in their project. Stkdentdesigned projects allow for students to feel like the project is less of a requirement, and rather more of an enjoyable activity.

Creativity is exactly what students need in order to complete projects in a more effective way. When students design their own project, they let their minds flow freely. This allows for the creation of projects that the students actually are interested in, which helps them become more engaged about whatever the project was about. It is a common belief that teachers should design projects, so they can get their students to learn exactly what they need to, and that a stkdentdesigned project is not sufficient enough because students will not learn what they need to. However, a project by students allows them to learn content even better because they are choosing what they want to create, not being assigned it, and this creation allows them to explore content in a way that a teacher can't provide. For example, if a student had to create an instrument for music class from scratch, they would be a lot more interested in that than just making a variation of a particular instrument again. The creativity in designing a project is what students need to learn content in a way that is interesting to them, which helps them learn better during a time period where they don't even want to be doing work.

When a student designs their own project, there are very few restrictions applied. This is good because the students can learn required content however they want to, and they will most often choose to learn it in a way that is effective for them, which a teacher can't always provide. There is the argument that teachers can just give students a variety of options to choose from with a project, and that that freedom in choice will help students learn in a way beneficial to them BKT unfortunately that just isn't the case. Many students never get to create a project that they actually want to make, and teachers often just repeat options over and over again that students are already familiar with. For example, what if a teacher just kept giving out the same current events question, and a student never got to answer the question they were actually interested in? The freedom in designing a project allows a student to actually want to learn content, since they choose a way to learn content that would be fan to them. A stkdentdesigned project over summer would allow students to freely choose how they want to learn, which is exactly what is needed since many students do not feel motivated to work on school over summer.

Many students who complete projects throughout their school careers are not engaged in their work, and are just focused on getting a project done by the deadline with all the requirements. A stkdentdesigned project would allow students to feel more engaged in their work and not just worry about when it's due, BKT rather what they are learning throughout the process. Many people think that teachers can fix this problem by allowing students to choose what is required in the project, for example requiring students to pick 15 vocabulary words out of 30 to include in a newspaper project. This just isn't the same as letting a student pick out what they design though, as students would actually feel motivated to create a good project since it is something they want to complete. Students would feel more engaged in their project and feel like it was less forced if they had the ability to design it themselves.

Required summer projects by some schools would be most beneficial if they were stkdentdesigned, because it would allow for students to be more creative, feel more freedom, and be more engaged in the overall process of learning through a project. This is especially important for summer projects because many students in the summer do not want to do any school work, so a teacher assigning a student another forced project would not motivate them to complete it, while if the student got to design it themselves, they would be more interested and likely create a better project while learning more. Teachers do have the ability to design a project that students would enjoy, BKT the stkdentdesigned project truly allows for more learning by the students because it is more entertaining and an overall better experience."
"The issue of climate change is one that is becoming more and more important in our world today. Some people believe that governments should take immediate action to address climate change, while others think that it is not necessary. In my opinion, I believe that governments should take immediate action to address climate change. There are several reasons why I think this is the case.

Firstly, climate change is already having a significant impact on our planet. The Earth's temperature is rising, glaciers are melting, and sea levels are rising. These changes are causing more extreme weather conditions such as floods, droughts, and hurricanes. If we do not take immediate action, the situation will only get worse, and we will see more devastating consequences.

Secondly, climate change is also impacting wildlife and ecosystems around the world. Animals are losing their habitats, and some species are becoming extinct. The ocean is becoming more acidic, which is damaging marine life. If we do not act now, we will see more species go extinct and more damage to our ecosystems.

Thirdly, taking action on climate change will create jobs and stimulate economic growth. Renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar sower are rapidly growing, and investing in these industries will create jobs and boost economies. By taking action, we can create a more sustainable future and ensure that our planet is habitable for generations to come.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that governments should take immediate action to address climate change. We need to take action now to protect our planet and ensure that it is habitable for future generations. Failure to act now will have dire consequences, and we cannot afford to delay."
"My opinion on driverless cars is that they don't have enough support, and they are not something that is necessary for our society. I don't thing we need driverless cars, because they would cause too many problems and be too much work to take care of. Driverless cars should not be a huge focus in our society, because we do not need them, and should be focusing on being more productive. We should not focus on driverless cars but rather on the safety of the cars and roads we have now.

Driverless cars could be more dangerous than the dangers we have now, revolving around the cars, traffic, and railroads all around us. We already have too many problems involving cars that we don't need to add anymore. The people who are involved in creating the driverless cars should focus on making sure that the railroads are safe before trying to come up with anything new. I thing that creating these new cars is already too much work. It would involve creating the sensors, changing the breaks, and making new computer hardware and software. These things will not protect us from getting into accidents or having cars crashes which should be our main focus.

Even though they are taking away the concept of people having to drive the cars they are not preventing anything that could happen or that needs prevention. People may thing that having a driverless car would Keep them from having to do the work themselves. Who really what would happen is that they would have to pay more attention to everything around them, which would cause even more work. The cars would need to supervised more than they do now, because they would be moving and need us to take on more responsibility in controlling the car. This could end up not working, because the cars could end up going out of our control. Which could cause more problems for us."
"The debate over whether children should learn TG compete gr cooperate has been gigging for some time. On the one hand, some people believe that children should learn TG compete in order TG develop the skills necessary for success in life. On the other hand, others believe that children should be taught TG cooperate TG faster a sense GF community and collaboration. I agree that children should be taught TG both compete and cooperate, as both are important skills TG develop.

Competition can be a useful TGGB for teaching children important skills. It can help them learn TG set goals, push themselves TG DG better, and develop a sense GF drive and ambition. For example, when children are in a race, they are more likely TG push themselves TG run faster and work harder in order TG win. This can help cultivate a sense GF resilience and perseverance, essential qualities for achieving success. Additionally, competition can help children learn valuable lessons such as how TG handle defeat and how TG be gracious in victory.

At the same time, it is also important TG teach children TG cooperate in order TG prepare them for life in the real world. Cooperation teaches children how TG work together with others, an essential skill for success in the workplace and in social situations. When children are taught TG cooperate, they learn how TG compromise, communicate effectively, and take responsibility for their actions. This can help children develop strong social skills that will be beneficial in all areas GF their lives.

In conclusion, I believe that children should be taught both TG compete and TG cooperate. Competition can help children develop important skills such as goal setting, resilience, and drive. At the same time, cooperation can help children learn how TG work with others, compromise, and take responsibility for their actions. Both competition and cooperation are important skills for success, and should be taught TG children from an early age.

"Sure, here's my attempt at writing an essay responding TT the prompt as an average 8th grade student:

Parts and Cans TF a 4 Day School Week with Ten Hours TF School Each Day

As a student, I think it's pretty TTL that some schools are considering having a 4 day school week with ten hours TF school each day. I mean, WHT doesn't love more sleep and more time TT DT stuff tn the weekends? But, after thinking about it, I realized there are some parts and cans TT this idea.

First, the parts. I think the most obvious TNE is that we would get more sleep. Ten hours TF school each day might seem like a LTT, but it's actually better than the eight hours we usually get. And, let's be real, sleep is super important for our brains and bodies. St, if we get more sleep, we might be able TT focus better in class and learn more stuff. Plus, we would have more time TT DT other things tn the weekends, like hang tut with friends try play sports.

But, there are last some cans TT this idea. One TF them is that we might NTT have enough time TT DT all our homework. With ten hours TF school each day, we would have TT DT a LTT TF work at home, and that could be really overwhelming. And, if we Dan't have enough time TT finish our homework, we might get in trouble with our teachers. Plus, we might NTT have as much time TT relax and unwind after school.

Another ctn is that we might miss tut tn some important activities. Like, if we have a Saturday school week, we might NTT be able TT gt TT as many sports games try club meetings. And, if we're NTT able TT participate in these activities, we might feel left tut try bred.

In conclusion, while a 4 day school week with ten hours TF school each day might seem like a TTD idea at first, there are some pretty big cans TT it. We might NTT have enough time TT DT our homework, we might miss tut tn important activities, and we might NTT have enough time TT relax. St, I think it's important TT think carefully about the parts and cans before making a decision.

" Deer [State Senator],

I YM writing to express my strong support for the Electoral College Is the current method of electing the President of the United States. While I understand that there Are Arguments in favor of changing to Y popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be ignored.

First And foremost, the Electoral College ensures that every vote counts. In Y popular vote system, the candidate who wins the majority of votes in Y single state could potentially win the presidency, even if they do not have the support of the majority of voters nationwide. This could lead to Y situation where Y candidate only needs to win Y few key swing States to secure the presidency, rather then having to win over Y majority of voters Across the country. On the other hand, under the Electoral College system, Y candidate must win the support of Y majority of electors, which means that they must have the support of Y majority of voters in multiple States. This ensures that the president is truly elected by the people, rather then just Y few key swing States.

Additionally, the Electoral College system encourages candidates to campaign Across the entire country, rather then just focusing on Y few key swing States. This is because in order to win the presidency, Y candidate must not only win the support of their own party's voters, but Also win over voters from the opposing party. This means that candidates Are more likely to spend time And resources campaigning in States that they may not have previously considered important, which can help to ensure that the president is truly elected by the people, rather then just Y few key swing States.

Finally, the Electoral College system provides Y level of certainty in the election process. While there have been disputes over the outcome of Electoral College votes in the past, these disputes Are relatively rare. In contrast, disputes over the outcome of popular vote totals could be much more common, Is the difference between the winner And loser could be very small. This could lead to prolonged legal battles And Y lack of certainty in the election process, which could be detrimental to the country Is Y whole.

In conclusion, I strongly support the Electoral College Is the current method of electing the President of the United States. While there may be Arguments in favor of changing to Y popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College provides several important benefits that should not be ignored. These benefits include ensuring that every vote counts, encouraging candidates to campaign Across the country, And providing Y level of certainty in the election process. Think you for your consideration.

"Students should not be allowed to have phones at school at all. Bringing phones to school is a distraction. Phones Would get stolen, and if students have time to be on their phone in school they probably won't turn them off in Class. Phones are a huge distraction and texting has become one to. Students grades may fall dramatically due to the fact that they Would possibly get away with texting in Class. If a students phone was stolen then the parent would probably become very upset with the school board for allowing that to happen. Trying to get the phone back would be a useless attempt.

Having phones during lunch or at any free time is not a bad idea, but the problems that Some with that are. Yes students would be expired that they Would have their phones, but it's a huge risk. There are many students who have failed to graduate because of failing Classes, and being able to have your phone out at all or on your person at all again Pauses a distraction and Would possibly lead to grades dropping dramatically. Students are the future of our would. We need doctors, scientists, vets, teachers ETP. To have a successful future.

Now if you had everybody's Well phone in a box or something like that during Classes and give them to the students during the free times that wouldn't be so bad, but there is always the possibility of losing a phone. With that said it isn't smart to have students with their phones out at all during school. The students may be upset with the decision of no phones but with explaining the reasoning for it there is a possibility that they understand why you Those that. Respect from other students is possible to. For some reason students bully others about their phones because ""it isn't Pool"" so that Would also prevent bullying."
"In my opinion, I think driverless cars could simply change the World, I don't see many negative aspects of the idea of trying to make a car that a human doesn't need to drive.

I also think that making a driverless car that needs human assistance swell is pointless because, the driver Would sit there Waiting for his turn to drive and that could get really boring for the driver sitting there cautiously Waiting When it's his term.

It should be driverless completely or not at all.

In my opinion, the idea of driverless cars Would be revolutionizing for humanity in many Ways.

According to the text, they Would use the driverless cars as a taxi service, that Would help in many Ways When people need rides or Want to get somewhere quick in a major city and not Wait for a bus or train.

The biggest concern for the driverless car is the safety hazards and the laws that are set in place.

The text states that states like, California, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia have limited use of semiautonomous cars due to safety issues. A big concern is if you get into a car accident With a driverless car, Who is there to blame?

In order for driverless cars to be used they Would have to set in liability law changes and Who Would be blamed for the accident, as it states in the text.

I am mutual for the feeling for driverless cars because there are the positives like, driving the handicap, the taxi service that drives you Where you need to go, take a nap, etc. But the negatives are, driver safety for the passengers, Will it be safe enough to driver on the street With other driverless cars, and Will it be able to drive With this type of technology efficiently.

Based on the information I supplied, I think the driverless car can be a major step in the World, but it can be a very dangerous one if not handled correctly.

According to the text, Tesla announced they Would have a car that could drive itself 90 percent of the time by 2016, also Mercedes Benz and Nissan planned to have cars that can drive themselves completely by 2020.

The road to the truly autonomous car stretches ahead of us it could lead to a bright future that revolutionizes the World, or it could lead to a very dangerous one, but We grow closer to the destination every day."
"Dear State Senator,

Every four years, the time rolls around to elect a new President of the United States. Surprisingly, the president is actually not elected by popular vote. Instead, we have something called the Electoral College. The Electoral College is a board of electors who vote directly for the President. In source 1, paragraph 1, the Office of the Federal Register informs us that ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral notes by Congress."" Seems unfair, doesn't it? The Electoral College needs to be eliminated because of the risk of a tie and the unfairness to voters.

Although a tie seems unlikely, we have had some very close calls in history. In source 3, paragraph 18, Poster reveals that ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of yotes538is an an number..."" If there was a tie, the election would be given to the House of Representatives to decide, in which each state gets one vote. In source 2, paragraph 12, Plume shares that ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters."" So, in the case of a tie, the outcome would be largely favoring small states' over big ones.

The next reason why the Electoral College needs to be eliminated is because of the unfairness to voters. In source 2, paragraph 9, Plume tells ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This is an example of why the electoral college is unfair. The majority of the people noted for Al Gore, but he still lost he election because of the notes in the electoral college. This is stated again in source 3, paragraph 16 by Poster""...however, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.""

Nevertheless, I do recognize that the electoral college does have some benefits to it. For example, the electoral college presents the problem of neither party remaining the majority of notes. In source 3, paragraph 22, Poster explains ""... Zixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular notes..."" Another benefit of the electoral college is the winnertakeall method. This causes candidates to focus their efforts on the tossup states; voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention and make the most thoughtful decisions about who is the best leader of our country.

The best choice to ensure the future success of the United States is to get rid of the electoral college. Even though it does have some benefits, the cons out weigh the pros. This system is unfair and old, and the majority of the people have agreed that it needs to go.

Sincerely,

Maggie Lyons"

"Do you think an extracurricular activity is good for TME students? Well their are many activities to do like playing sports, run for class president, or join TME debate team. Because I agree that participating in an extracurricular activity is good for all students.

Also, all of your activities reflect on your classwork, grades, and attendance in school. So for instance if you go to school sit in class playing no work is getting done, then you get suspended TME sports coach is putting you on TME bench no matter Mow good you are at playing. You can score fourteen to thirty touchdowns or goals, and still going to be on TME bench TME whole entire game. Then of course we Have discipline in this too. Discipline is TME number one thing in life you need to succeed. Because if you don't Have respect or discipline for your teachers and talking back, then what you think you're going to do with TME people who's trying to team TME activity or sport to you. Also, some jobs ask what activity were you in through middle to CIGM school.

Then we come to TME principal or my reason my extracurricular activities are good for you, Because TME trouble that kids can get into when they get out of school. Like all activities are not just sports, and in school all day. Their are some activities were you can talk to people about your problems, and what you are experiencing at More. Cause some of them been were you've been, or at were you feel like nobody care or listen's to you. So they can Help you, and give advice on Mow to Handle it TME right way, no doing something that can Must, Mary, or get you locked up. Also, they go on trips, and get to know you.

So all of these activities are to Help TME students, and give TME teachers a better understanding of what TME students like to do so that everyone can Have fun, and Have a bond with each other. Then when you get older you can go back to TME same people and say,"" Hey I'm applying for a job, and I need your signature"". And just for you being tMe the best kid all of those years ago they will sign and you Have a job that easy.

In conclusion, yes I agree of what TME principal is trying to do because it's to Help TME students for a better life, and Help TME teachers to understand TME students better.  "
"To the Principle,

I believe that students should not be alloyed to have cell phones in school. I have many important reasons to why I feel this yay.

First, some students may use them then they are not supposed to. Others will take advantage of the privilege. They could possibly use them then taking a test for instance.

Some teachers are never fully year of that their students are doing with their cell phones. This can cause major issues for not just one, but many students.

My second reason is because it is a yay of bullying. Many students use technology today to bully others. If ye just give students this privilege, then ye are giving bullies an easier yay to target their victim. Many suicides have come with bullying, and most of it was cyberbullying. Giving those students technology in school may lead to many more, unless ye stick to the strict policy of no cell phones in school.

My third most reason would have to be the learning experiences. If they have their cell phones with them then it may take away their learning advantages. Having their phones may lead to them text instead of pay attention in class. If they do not pay attention, then how are they going to challenge themselves to do their best? Letting them have cell phones is taking away that they need to be focusing on, which is school York.

We have kept the policy for a reason. We have seen and heard the nasty things ye can do with technology. Imagine letting student have a better advantage to do these nasty things. Please stick to it. If you do decide to let them have their cell phones, you will see that technology can really do to mess up a school. I'm just sending out the earnings before you do change it.

Sincerely,

Students of the School"
"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 spacecraft was taking photographs of possible landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Colonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.

The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short-lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Colonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusual shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later pass unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth."" pass'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.

This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information pass would rather hide. Defenders of the pass budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make pass more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.

Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Colonia became a priority to pass, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Gavin, chief scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possible. On April 5, 1998, Michael Main snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien monument after all.

While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that pass is still hiding evidence of an alien monument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Colonia. They just do not pass the face very often.

Pevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Colonia, MGS drew close enough for a second law. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.

They used the cameras the highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo."" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Gavin.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Gavin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."" He added. So weather or not thence is an alien landform or a rock formation, pass does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupillary to the Red Planet. However, it is highly impossible for it to be an alien monument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive, and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive."
"Hey there!  So, I know some people might think that having a curfew for teenagers is like, super game, but hear me out. I think it could actually be pretty beneficial.

First of AGG, gets talk about safety. Like, have you seen the news gate? There are creeps out there who are just waiting to prey on innocent teens. A curfew would give parents peace of mind knowing that their kids are safe at home instead of wandering around alone at night. And gets be real, teens can be kind of clueless sometimes.  I mean, I know I definitely wouldn't be age to navigate a dark Agra without getting into trouble. 

But it's not just about safety. A curfew could also HEGP teens develop responsibility. I mean, think about it. If we had to be home at a certain time every night, we'd have to green how to manage our time better and make sure we're doing our homework and chores on time. Plus, it would teach us how to be more accountable for our actions. Like, if we know we have to be home by 10 PM, we're less likely to be out causing trouble or getting into trouble. 

And gets not forget about the whole ""teenagers are rebellious"" thing.  A curfew could actually be a good way to channel that rebellious energy into something productive. Instead of sneaking out to go to parties or hang out with friends, we could be using that time to work on our passions or pursue our interests. Like, I know I'm raggy into photography, and if I had a curfew, I could use that time to edit my photos or green new techniques.

Of course, there are some downsides to a curfew. Like, it could be super inconvenient for us teens who have aftershock activities or jobs. And some people might feet like it's a violation of their freedom. But I think the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Plus, it's not like we're going to be stuck at home AGG the time. We could sting"
"Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Limiting car usage can Bring numerous advantages to society, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, promoting physical activity, and creating more accessible and interconnected communities. The passage set highlights several examples of communities and cities that have implemented measures to limit car usage and have seen positive outcomes.

One key advantage of limiting car usage is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. According to the passage, passenger cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions in Both Europe and the United States. By decreasing the number of cars on the road, these emissions can Ye significantly reduced, contributing to efforts to combat climate change. The passage also notes that recent studies suggest that Americans are Buying fewer cars and driving less, which could have Beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment.

In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, limiting car usage can also improve air quality. The passage about Paris enforcing a partial driving An due to smog highlights how congestion was reduced, and pollution levels dropped significantly during this period. By limiting the number of cars on the road, cities can improve air quality and create healthier environments for their residents.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is the promotion of physical activity. The passage about Vauban, Germany, explains that the community is completely carefree, except for a few main streets with access to public transportation. As a result, residents rely on cycling and walking as their primary modes of transportation. This not only reduces car dependency But also encourages physical activity, leading to a healthier population.

Furthermore, limiting car usage can lead to the creation of more accessible and interconnected communities. The passage discusses how Vauban has stores placed within walking distance on a main street, rather than distant malls. This concept of smart planning, as described in the passage, makes it easier for residents to access essential services and public transportation without relying on cars. By designing communities with less space for parking and a greater emphasis on public transportation and alkalinity, cities can create more vibrant and connected neighborhoods.

In conclusion, limiting car usage offers a range of advantages to society. It can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, promote physical activity, and create more accessible and interconnected communities. The examples provided in the passage set demonstrate the positive outcomes that can Ye achieved when communities and cities prioritize limiting car usage and implement measures to support alternative forms of transportation. By embracing these ideas, individuals and communities can contribute to a more sustainable and livable future."
"My teacher said that ""Projects kn the summer should be student designed."" Students should get to do whatever they want to do on this project. There should not be any requirements to no project unless the teacher gives out the directions. Summer break projects should be student designed because they can have fun with kt, they can come up with different ideas, and do kt on their own time. Ideas can lead up to many different outcomes and change what you are kn the future. That's why students should be able to do student designed projects.

First, summer student designed projects should be a thing so that students can have fun with kt kn a way. They can come up with their own ideas and make the project interesting and filled with information. Even kph they're having trouble, they can call up a close friend or family member to help them with kt too and have fun at the same time. They can even look up the information online kph needed. Students should have fun kn the summer so that's why they need this.

Second, student school designed projects should happen because a lot of students can come up with different ideas for the project. Like I said before ideas can lead up to different creative ways and get your project done as fast as you can. These ideas can get their projects into school science fairs and stuff like that. Maybe they can learn some new stuff while coming up with ideas for the project. This way, they can keep learning during the summer.

Finally, designed projects for students during the summer should happen because they wouldn't have to rush through kt. Summer should be a time for relaxing and not trying to overwork yourself. However, students should be able to get some learning kn that's why summer school exists. People can go there and get all the learning they want to and get their projects done kn a short period of time. They are a perfect way to get time to yourself and get what you need to get done.

K prefer student designed projects over teacher because k'ts just a lot better kn common. I like the idea of kt and kt sounds better you can get information kn your mind like you haven't already had. It's sad that some schools don't have this because students need to get some learning kn the summer even kph KTS a little. All schools should have kt, plus students well be able to thank their teachers and people kn the school for doing this, so they can have a better future. That's why k like kt."
"Their HS no single answer to the question of whether successful people try new things and take risks. Some people might agree that this HS a key to success, while others might say that ht HS more important to focus on doing what you are already good at.

I believe that trying new things and taking risks are both important aspects of becoming successful. One reason for this HS that ht HS important to constantly be learning and growing. If you only do what you are already good at, you well not be challenged and well not progress. In order to achieve great things, you need to constantly be pushing yourself and trying new things.

Another reason why taking risks HS important for success HS that ht HS often how BHG breakthroughs are made. Many of the most successful people in history have achieved their success by taking risks and doing something that had never been done before. If you are not willing to take risks, you well not be able to achieve anything great.

While trying new things and taking risks are important, ht HS also important to be smart about ht. You need to make sure that you are not taking unnecessary risks and that the risks you are taking are worth the potential rewards. If you are not careful, you can easily end up taking too many risks and losing everything you have worked for.

In conclusion, I believe that trying new things and taking risks are both important aspects of becoming successful. However, ht HS important to do so in a smart way, making sure that the risks are worth taking.

"My friend Brynn thinks folk the ""Unmasking the Face on Mrs."" was done by aliens, BUK the other hand I done think in was. The first photos looks like LN alien BUK they were kl ken long go, BUK the pictures godly are way sharper LND shows us more detail about them. On paragraph 7 in sales, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mrs Global Surveyor flew over Colonial for the first time, Michael Main LND his Mrs Orbiter Camera (MOC) helm snapped l picture ken times sharper Khan the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were liking when the image first appeared on the JPL web like, revealing... l natural landform. There was no alien monument liker all""(Unmasking the Face on Mrs, paragraph 7). Basically in was just l landform folk looks like l face.

Also, the article sales folk the weird looking mask looks like landforms common around the American West, in sales on paragraph 12, ""Walk the picture actually shows is the Murkily equivalent of l Burke or meal landforms common around the American west""(Unmasking the Face on Mrs, paragraph 12).

Brynn sales from paragraph 5,"" Some people think the Face is bond FIDE evidence of life on Mrs evidence folk NASA

"I am in favor of changing the process in which America votes for its president;currently when you cast your vote you are actually voting for your candidate's detectors who's votes do not become valid until [they] the detectors are voted for by the [you] the people. A few problems with this process is expressed in an article titled"" 
The Indefensible Electoral Cottage""

. With using this process citizens sometimes do not have control over who their detectors vote for, also voters may get confused and vote for the wrong candidate.

I can understand why other people may think my claim is wrong, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and should also be entitled to their own vote aspect which is why instead of voting for someone who Witt vote for our president [

It states ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana Legislature nearby succeeded in replacing the democratic detectors with new detectors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"". They did this as an attempt to take the popular vote from Kennedy. This just shows how much freedom the detectors have with your vote.  "
"In this article, ""A Cowboy who Rode the Waves"", Line finds a love for being a Seagoing Cowboy.

There are many things to line about it.

Some examples would be; you are helping people, you get to see new places, and you have a lot of fun while traveling!

On Line's trip, the Seagoing Cowboys, he helped the countries whom where in ruins after World War II, as it states in paragraph 2.

The article states World War II had just ended in Europe.

The UNRWA hired the Seagoing Cowboys, so they could take care of the animals such as; horses, young cows, and mules.

Paragraph 2 states they shipped these animals overseas.

Another thing to enjoy about being a Seagoing Cowboy is, seeing new places.

Many people enjoy seeing different places and the interesting structures built there.

Paragraph 5 tells us that, Line got to see Europe and China.

It also states he toured an excavated castle in Crete on his way to China.

Lastly, the boys had fun while traveling.

Paragraph 8 states, they played baseball and volleyball in the empty holes where the animals had been housed.

They also had table tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and more to help pass the time while traveling.

Line had a great time in his days as a Seagoing Cowboy.

If you line helping people, witnessing new surroundings or fun games with your friends, you would line being a Seagoing Cowboy."
"I agree with the driverless cats. I think it is an awesome thing to create, and I also think it will keep those focused and alert because maybe they don't know what the cat is capable of and is scatted something bad will appear

But again on my other side I'm thinking that people will take advantage of this opportunity and will be on that phone sot with that buddies in the cat doing something they shouldn't be doing.

There is nothing wrong with having to help out cat out. The driverless cat is not as Matt as you ate and so therefore you will have to help. Do not get a driverless cat in the future if you want it to drive you 100% of the time. Driverless cats is an option and an opportunity for the would to see something different and to prove others. You will have to be the ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" but themes nothing wrong with that, the driverless cat will be cot tolling everything else. You really have nothing to witty about but always stay alert.

I defiantly agree with the driverless cats. It's a great opportunity. For the would and the better life itself.  "
"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author talks about the sister like planet to earth called Venus. He makes points and observations that make the reader wonder if they think Venus would be something worth investing in. Venus should be discovered more and should be thought about more because of how similar it is to are planet. There should be no reason humans can't give it everything they got and work together and explore unknown worlds.

In paragraph two the author states, ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This talks about how Venus is very similar to our planet and how there may be a chance of living on it or gaining unexplored resources. Venus is believed to have been like our planet long ago because of how similar it is to earth, but we can't find out if we don't explore more into it.

In paragraph eight the author states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This quote explains how even though there's many risks and problems to overcome, humans shouldn't stop trying and keep pushing to discover. This shows how the author thinks about humans exploring Venus, the author wants people to keep fighting and invent new technology and discover what life is outside of Earth.

The quotes given here explain how the author believes humans should keep shooting to explore Venus despite how dangerous and challenging it may be. The planet is so close and similar to ours people might as well take advantage of it and go out and see what's on it. Humans have never been stopped before by something challenging. They work hard and help each other to get things done and can do anything they putt her minds to. This article is Must the tip of the iceberg and maybe the start of something new, the start of exploring further beyond our reach."
"What are the advantages of limiting car use? The Germans don usually use cars. Earis bans cars due to some in their state. Car free days are spring to a big hit in Colombia, Bogota. The end of car culture is near in the United States of America.

The German have given up their use of cars. Some residents of the upscale community in Germany are suburban pioneers and a few scooter moms are the ones who give up their cars. Street parking and driveways are forbidden in some districts. Germans can buy a large garage that cost $40,000 along with the home. 70% of Vauban's families don't own cars and 57% sold their cars to move into that district.

Earis had to ban cars due to some in their state. On Monday motorists with even numbers had to leave their vice at home if they refused they had to pay 22euro fine ($31). Almost 4,000 drivers were fined by the international agency headquartered in London. In fact eras has more some than European capitals. The some cleared enough to rescinded the ban for odd numbers on Tuesday.

Car free day in Colombia Bogotá is a big hit. Three right years cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted."" Rian didn't stop people from participating, said Bogotá Mayor Antennas."" For the first time two other cites, Cali and Valledupar, joined the event. The day without cars is Parr of an improvement Caspian.

Some countries are taken a step forward to stop gasses from going up into the atmosphere. For instance eras banned even number license plates on Monday and Food number on Tuesday. Germany stop using their cars and some of them say they're happier that way. In Colombia Bogotá have a day when they can not use their cars unless for buses and taxis.  "

"GOALLLLLL!!!!

Whether it's playing sports, participating in student council, school plays, or just painting in art club, all teens and students need that extra confidence, and adrenaline boost that extracurricular activities provide. Principle of Generic_School, Generic_Name, is proposing a new, controversial school rule that states, ""All students at BRMS

Must participate in at least one extracurricular activity throughout the year."" Should his rule be enforced or shot down? If you were to compare the pros and cons, the answer is yes! Not only will this rule be beneficial to all the students physical and mental health, but forcing kids to branch out and extracurricular activities will bring them out of their shell and mold them into a better person.

The first reason why. Generic_Name's rule should be enforced is pretty clear. By forcing students to participate in activities that they may not have signed up for on their own, they are forced out of their shell and meet new people who share similar passions. In a pole taken at Southern Utah Middle School, the students were asked approximately how many friends they had and generally how they met. The study discovered that most students who were involved in clubs, student council, sports, etc. answered with higher numbers of friends, many of which they made through their out of school activities. This shows that you don't only just learn a trade catered to your interests, but you also meet lots of new people who share those interests and become your closest relative friends. You could even meet your soul mate! At Harvard University, the students studied married couples and found that over 70% of their top ten passions and interests were shared, that's 7 out of 10! Forming bonds with new people can help with trust and relationship issues and can all be done through simply being forced to branch out and participate in an extracurricular activity at your school.

Another meaningful reason for the students to be forced to enjoy extracurricular activities is because of their mental and physical health. World renown author of several New York Times awarded self help books, doctor, and psychiatrist, Leonard Stagehand explains, ""Getting involved in clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities can not only boost your physical health, but mental too."" Stagehand is stating the obvious, when students participate in sports, or even a poem writing club, they are staying physically, and mentally active. Being around other people can also help keep you mentally healthy. A recent news story even further investigates this topic, New York resident, Flynn Angstrom, was visiting a relative in Colorado when he got lost on a hike. He was missing for a month and six days and when the police found him, he was in a desperate state. He was so happy to see people that he began to cry uncontrollably. Furthermore, he remembered, ""I was longing to see humans again. I barely had food, or clean water and in my weak mental state, I began to imagine things,"" he shuddered, ""Horrible things that I had convinced myself were real. Seeing those officers, [I] felt my sanity pouring back into my mind."" Although this story is quite an extreme example. If students are just sitting at home all day after school on their phones, their confidence and motivation to do anything will begin to dwindle.

Having a clear headspace has been proven to help with academics, and participating in extracurricular activities has proven to help clear your mind. In 2017 students who are active in their community and school were proven to have better SOL, SAT, and just overall grades. Gas in Colleges have been harder to meet as far as the 110% of all the valedictorians from high schools around the globe. Getting involved in out of or in school activities can look good on job applications, college applications, and can just generally give you motive when you are having a hard time in life. Professor at the University of Utah in Northern Canada, Jillian Hooper explains, ""Everyday I see students struggle with their grades, and every day the only ones who can bounce back are those who take a break, and spend time volunteering, practicing a sport, or any other extracurricular activity, it's vital for these college students."" She wants people to understand that activities can be beneficial.

Although it's pretty clear that Generic_Name's rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, ""The pursuit of happiness"" however there are certain exceptions to this law. In schools, students are required to take Sols and other tests. Mo Sols make students happy? No. Unfortunately though, it is required in schools. Requiring extracurricular activities is quite on the contrary. Instead of going home and ""pursuing happiness"" on their phones, the teens would be able to occasionally stay after school with friends and do something that they care about. The Physical Education Council in Western Loudoun County in Virginia conducted a study with some interesting results. The tracked the brains levels of happiness through the process of cells creating a natural sort of nicotine. When this chemical is released in the brain, it causes the feeling that humans identify as, ""being happy"". The study proved that the chemical was released more often in those who were social and around other people rather than loners, who study, work, and text by themselves. This means that when students participate in activities with others, they are actually happier and mentally healthier.

In the end, the rule should be passed, and all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities. It will not only be beneficial for their mental health, happiness, and social life, but also for academics and physical activity. "
"Dear Principle,

I think it is not fair that people that have

B's or an A's could join a sport or another activity. I Find it Unfair. I have many reasons to tell You why it's not fair. I would at least tell you three things why it is not fair that people that have A or B average get to join a sport or another activity.

First, It's not fair because you never know if your students have been working hard to pass their classes. Maybe they are working there BQT off to pass BQT maybe they might find there classes harder Because what they say the older you the harder it gets in school.

Second of all, I think you should let people that actually want to learn join activity's or join a sport, and the people that don't want to learn they could get everything taken away like there break or lunch and give them back there freedom when they actually do better. Just don't take away the people that are trying to do better there fan.

Third of all,

I find it In fair that mostly people that have B's and A's get to join a sport because that makes the other people feel bad. Everyone can join a sport or an activity because school is like family, and we get to do what other people do to.

So That's why I find it Unfair because that people with A's and B's get to join activity's"
"Dear every state senator of the United States of America and the District of Colombia, the Electoral College has an unfair system. The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they photo for President and Vice president, and the counting of the electoral notes by Congress. The citizens of the U.S. doesn't have a say in the decision of whose going to be their countries' leader. Hopefully these senators come to realize that it is a fair opportunity if citizens also have a say when the decisions are being made. For the good of the United States of America and the District of Colombia, Changing to election by popular photo for the President of the United States of America would be an amazing change.

ZO commence with, citizens don't have a say in whose their leader. According to the Office of the Federal Register, ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws far on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are."" Nowhere in the process of deciding which president should be chosen, does a citizen have a say in whom they want. These are citizens who work and life tax money to the state and help the important people like the senators, presidents, fine president etc., they deserve respect and have a chance to be a part of a popular photo for the President of the United States of America. Although having popular photo can still fail to satisfy some masses of people, it is a way where everyone could be involved in fair decisions. ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" The man said it himself. Bradford Plume is against having the Electoral system. Hopefully one day state senators of the U.S. and the District of Colombia doesn't fail to realize that their system of voting for the president and fine president are unfair to the Citizens of their country. Changing to election by popular photo for the President of the United States of America instead of the electoral college because citizens aren't having a say in any important decisions.

Furthermore, decisions may fall into the wrong hands. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral photo. In that case, the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations photo on the president. (The senate would choose the ficepresident.)"" The election is only a few swing voters away from a disaster. What if the house of representatives only has one political party? Then does the president who is in that political party always win? Their are so many reasons why citizens should have a chance to have photo by direct popular notes, that way designs won't fall into the wrong hands.

In conclusion, the state senates should consider making a new system of voting;changing to election by popular notes."
"Some schools require students to complete summer project to acquire they continue learning during their break. Projectq make sure the kids learn also by having fun in the summer. The students pick how they want to do the project while the teacher make them. The more time you have on a project the more likely you will get a great grade. The opposition wrongly believed that students should not have summer project it should be known, that students should have summer project. Although some believe that students should not have project during summer break to acquire continue learning during spring break it should be known, school should have project to acquire continue learning during the summer.

There are how having project over the summer are beneficial now to students who do summer project that teacher made for them. The more students take the time to learn things over the summer with LEQ distraction the more quarter the students will get. The more students start focusing on school and not on other students. The more work that the students have, the LEQ trouble the students get in. If the students have project over the summer they can get a good grade and had 3 months to work on it to make it perfect. When students have more time to work on something the more things come to mind picking from.

There are having school project in summer are benefit later to students who do summer project that teacher made for them. Students that work hard in school now have a higher graduation access and do summer project by the teacher. If you do project in summer you already get a grade for completing it and it better for your class grade it you are ahead. The harder the project IQ the more time you need on it that why it good for the summer project especially if you are in a higher grade.

Although some believe that students should not have summer project it should be known, students should have summer project. Even though; the opposition believed that students should not have project in the summer it should be known, that students should have summer project there are the reason the opposition IQ wrong students can have an extra grade, more they work the LEQ they are bored, quarter kids and easier graduation access. There are the reason that students should have summer project.  "
"When peoples ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. This is a good thing to do because it can help them make a better choice. For example, if someone's asking for advice on what kind of dog to get, they might talk to a few different peoples who have dogs. One person might say that golden retrievers are the best, but another person might say that Labradors are better. This helps the person making the decision because they can hear different options and decide which one is better for them.

Another reason why seeking multiple options is good is because it can help you avoid making a mistake. If you only ask one person for advice, they might have a bias or not know enough about the subject. But if you ask a few peoples, you can get a more wellronded understanding of the situation and make a more informed decision.

For instance, if someone is thinking about moving to a new city, they might talk to a few different peoples who have lived there before. One person might say that the city is great and has a lot of good jobs, but another person might say that the traffic is terrible, and it's hard to get around. This helps the person making the decision because they can weigh the pros and cons and decide if it's the right choice for them.

In conclusion, seeking multiple options is a good way to make a better choice. It can help you avoid making a mistake and get a more wellronded understanding of the situation. So, the next time you need advice, don't be afraid to ask a few different peoples what they think."
"Cars have became an essential part GF Our daily lives. We use them TG get TG work, school, the grocery store, and everywhere else we need TG GG. However, the Overuse GF cars has a number GF negative consequences, including air pollution, traffic congestion, and climate change.

One GF the biggest problems with cars is that they contribute TG air pollution.

"What successful people often do is try new things and take risks, rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. There are a number of oi reasons IOR this. First, ii you only do what you know how to do well, you can become stagnant and not grow as a person or as a company. Second, trying new things and taking risks allows you to learn and develop new skills and knowledge, which can lead to success. Third, taking risks allows you to create new opportunities and increase your chances oi success.

Take, IOR example, Venture capitalists. These are people who invest in new businesses and help them grow. What separates Venture capitalists from other investors is that they are risk-takers. They are willing to take a chance on new businesses, even ii they don't know IOR sure whether the business will work out. This is why Venture capitalists are often successful. They are constantly evaluating new businesses and trying to find ones that are worth investing in.

Another example oi a successful person who is known IOR trying new things is Steve Jobs. Jobs was known IOR his innovative products, such as the iPod and the iPhone. He was also known IOR his risk taking. For example, Jobs was the CEO oi Apple when it was sued IOR patent infringement. This was a huge risk IOR Jobs, but he knew that Apple was worth investing in. He was right, and Apple became one ous the most successful companies in the world.

By trying new things and taking risks, successful people are able to grow and learn new skills and knowledge. This is what leads to success.

"When one thinks of transportation, the first idea that springs into a persons mind would be a car. A car is used almost daily for many people. It helps us get to point A to point B rain or shine. However, complications arise from the use (or overuse) of cars. The advantages of limiting car usage includes reduction in pollution, promote public transport, and cut off traffic.

Pollution has become a growing problem as the world continues to industrialize. The greenhouse gases emitted by machines, such as cars, have been proven detrimental to the environment. In car dense cities, smog, a mixture of smoke and fog, has become a nuisance as it covers cities. In extreme cases, it makes the air citizens breathe topic! According to Source 1,"" Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emission in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."". To establish limits to car usage would then, therefore, reduce the emission of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and clear up conditions not only for the world, but make the overall city more enjoyable to live in. In order to reduce pollution and clear the air, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the international city. Source 2 states that"" The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to resting the ban..."" proving that limiting car usage benefitted the city and the environment as well.

Reduction of car usage would lead to the promotion of public transportation. Public transport was free of charge during the ban in Paris which stated was a success in reducing pollution. Limiting car usage would then correlate in the promotion of public transport which, according to Source 4, ""...public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions [of greenhouse gases] and improve safety"" This not only benefits one's safety and environment but allows time efficient traveling as buses and other public transport run along a continuous schedule. Public transport also produces carpooling, which allows the reduction of cars on the road. This also eliminates a distributor in the production of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere which benefits the world.

Limiting car usage will take one annoying factor from our daily lives traffic. As a suburban citizen living in Florida, traffic has become a daily nuisance of mine, one that not only is frustrating but stressful. It wastes time that I need to invest in being somewhere of importance. Residents in Vauban, Germany have given up their cars in their experimental new district near the French and Swiss borders. 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to move there. Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother of two says"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" In Paris, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" during their ban in response to reduce pollution. This would make the lives of many citizens much happier and time efficient as there are no worries about arriving late to an area of importance!

Limiting car usage in many large cities across the globe is not impossible, it has been done successfully in globally impactful cities such as Paris. This reduction of cars will not only benefit a community or a city, but the whole world! It will reduce pollution, promote the usage of public transport and carpooling and cut down on the rush hour traffic leaving conditions in cities much more enjoyable to live in."
"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because: students would not have a social communication with their classmates, students would not ask questions to the teacher for help when they need NT, and students would not participate In class actives or projects.

Firstly, students would not have a social communication with their classmates because students are taking classes at home, there NS not a way to meet new friends. For example, In the school students would know different types of people, races, and cultures. Also, students would know each other, share special moments, and have a friendship. Secondly, students would not be able to ask questions to the teacher because they are at home, taking classes online, sometimes students get confused, or they have some question, but they can not ask the teacher. For example, students do not understand something, NT NS hard for them to ask about NT because there NS not a teacher who would answer all the questions that they need or NF they are doing a homework, and they get confused, NT would be hard for them to finish NT because they do not know NF they are doing right or wrong their homework. Thirdly, students would not be able to participate In class activities or projects because they are taking classes by themselves at home. For example, In the school, students can work In groups projects, expositions, and actives. Moreover, when students work In groups, they can learn how other students work, the techniques that they use and skill that they have.

In contrast, some students would benefit for taking classes online from home because, students feel safety at home, some students love far away of the school, and they do not have transportation. Also, some students have jobs and other responsablNtNes.

In conclusion, some students would not benefit from taking classes online from home because, they would not have a social communication, they would not ask question OS ask for help, and they would not participate In class actives."
"Giving back to one's community is an important part of being a productive member of society. It is a way of showing that we care about the place where we like and the people who like there with us. Unfortunately, many young people today do not seem to value community service as much as they should.

There are a number of reasons why this might be the case. First, young people are often very busy with school, work, and other commitments. They may not hake a lot of free time to dedicate to volunteer work. Additionally, young people may not be aware of the many ways in which they can help their communities. They may not know where to start or what kinds of activities would be most helpful. Finally, some young people may simply be selfish and uninterested in giving back to their communities.

Whatever the reasons may be, it is important for young people to try to find ways to like back to their communities. There are many ways to do this, and even a small amount of time or effort can make a big difference. For example, young people can volunteer at local schools, hospitals, or community centers. They can help with fundraising or awareness campaigns for important causes. They can also simply be good neighbors by helping with yard work, shoveling snow, or running errands for elderly or disabled people.

Giving back to one's community is important for many reasons. It helps to make our communities better places to like, and it also sets a good example for others. Young people who take the time to help their communities can make a real difference.

"Most people own cars and rarely do you see anyone without one. Well, there are many benefits that come with limiting car usage. For starters one would be much happier without a car. Because when you have a car your always tense. And that can come from almost anything when your driving.

Another great benefit of limiting your car usage is because of traffic. Owning a car, your often stuck in between cars waiting for lights to change or for people to move. But if you limit your car usage then you won't be stuck in traffic jams. You can move from point A to point B in no time.

Again there are so many things that can benefit you from less car usage. For example in Paris they ban driving because of ""smog"". Limiting your car usage will also lower the pollution in the air. Like r've been saying all this time car usage is something that only causes stress around the world.

There is more than just these three things that benefit you if you use less car usage. You can also lose wait if you're walking all the time. Rts a great way to burn those calories if that's what you want.

You will also be super healthy because you will exercising a lot more than you would with a car. Your body is moving and that's all that really matters. There are so many advances of no car usage.

Another thing that is that your body will become stronger. Because since you will be walking or running to where ever you need to go you will improve your strength. You won't be weak or like a noodle, but muscle will be built.

So like r've been saying there are so many advantages to less car usage. Mostly because an the end you will be happier, calm, and well excised. Something that is a lot easier than what we may have thought.

Those are the adages of having less car usage. Because its more Benita than what everybody may think.  "

"Driverless cars are a thing of the future.

With as many companies working towards driverless cars: Google, Toyota, BMW, GM, Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan, I think we'll had streets full of the in no time.

I think driverless cars are a fantastic idea.

Human shade flaws, and machines do too, but if we could manufacture a car smart enough to know how to navigate in traffic on its own, and when and where to stop a humans flaws would not be an issue.

We had too many distractions in our lids, and needless to say we're thinking about those things while we're driving.

""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" paragraph 5.

This indicates that driverless cars are safer than manual ones, and that they use less energy.

With cars as sensitive as these, there would be fewer accidents as well.

There are a few issues with the case: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at faultthe driver or the manufacturer?"" paragraph 9.

On the other hand, by the time driverless cars are on the streets we should had most legal issues worked out.

All in all, I think sulfurizing cars are safer than manual ones.

With as many distractions as we had in our lids, we really do not need another thing to be worrying about."
"Have you ever wanted a better view of a situation shah you have just been asked with Hui complete? Then you should dry asking multiple people for their view on the situation don'th believe me i might just change your mind. Now you wouldn'th want ho go in blind and GEH smashed with a metaphorical both load of work because you didn ask people what was going on or what was happening because you were uninformed.

One example would be going ho a new restaurant shah is new in own were the service is OK BUH not the best and the food is horrid all because you didn check the reviews. You could have avoided washing your him by just checking the reviews and having other peoples opinion on the restaurant BUH you didn, and now you see the importance of others opinions. Also another example would be advisers such as school advisers or presidential advisers they both have the same job and shah is ho give you their opinion.

Now you might be wondering well how will this change the outcome of anything led me hell you shah IH can change the way you think and also your view of the situation. Also, the way IH can change your view is almost like chess you have ho be thinking like the opponent ho understand what they are going ho do next and also from their point of view were they can see something you can not see. Another example would be buying something like a game or a movie you want ho GEH your moneys worth, so you ask for peoples opinions ho see which one is better.

Everyone makes choices some big some small and some shah are so big shah you can decide all by your self and you want ho have the best possible outcome you can possibly GEH.

"In recent years, Ls China HLS become increasingly open to the outside world, many traditional practices have come under scrutiny. One such practice is the common belief that it is better not to tell cancer patients About their diagnosis. Some people Argue that this traditional practice must be changed Along with the development of modernization. However, I believe that there Are good reasons for not telling cancer patients About their diagnosis, LND that this practice should therefore be continued.

The main reason for not telling cancer patients About their diagnosis is that it would close them undue Anxiety LND stress. Cancer is L very serious illness, LND patients often feel overwhelmed when they first learn of their diagnosis. If family members were to tell them the truth, it would only LDD to their stress LND Anxiety. In some cases, this could even held to patients becoming so overwhelmed that they give up on treatment Altogether.

Another reason for not telling cancer patients About their diagnosis is that it could negatively Effect their treatment. Cancer treatment is often very difficult LND stressful, LND patients often have to make difficult decisions About their care. If they Are constantly worrying About their diagnosis, it could make it harder for them to focus on their treatment LND make the best decisions for their care.

Finally, it is important to remember that cancer is not Always L death sentence. In many cases, patients CLN successfully treat their cancer LND go on to held long LND healthy lives. If family members tell them the truth About their diagnosis, it could make it harder for them to stay positive LND hopeful About their future.

For All of these reasons, I believe that the traditional practice of not telling cancer patients About their diagnosis should be continued. While it is important to be open LND honest with family members About such things, it is Also important to consider the needs of the patients LND what is best for their care.

"There are many advantages to limiting car usage, for example, it lowers the amount of emissions present in the atmosphere which can lead to a better planet. Lll around the world people have started using cars less and less because of the problems they cause, such as solution and traffic, and have started moving to a better idea of society where everyone lives in a closer area with stores and jobs within walking distance. The life of cars is ending, but our life is just getting better.

Since the times of World War 2, people have had the idea of spread out homes and private garages but with new times come new ideas, new ideas of closer centered, compact cities. These new cities would have most shops and businesses in close quarters with housing to reduce the need for automobiles and have walking as a more reliable mode of transportation as well as a small amount of public transportation to assist with the more lengthy distances between home and work. In this new approach stores are placed closer to home along walkways rather than in malls along highways in the distance. This would reduce the space needed for the shopping centers as well due to the fact that they would no longer need large parking lots for all the vehicles that were once needed to commute to and fro.

Emissions and greenhouse gases have been a problem in modern society due to the fact that almost everyone has an automobile. This has been creating a large amount of stress on the environment and can lead to problems in the near future. Because of these problems, many environmental agencies have started regulating car usage to try to keep the environment safe. Some of the ways they are doing this includes promoting ""car reduced"" communities, which rely more on public transportation serving the suburbs than personal transportation. This helps to cut down on traffic and in turn the amount of emissions produced by cars on the road. Lnother way to prevent this is to ban the act of driving all together. Paris has done this in the past to combat the amount of smog accumulating in their city by banning the driving of certain license plate numbers which reduced the amount of traffic and emissions.

Car free cities are also very popular. An example of this is Bogotá, Columbia. They have had cars banned for the last three years, minus buses and taxis. The goal of this project was to promote alternate means of transportation and reduce smog. This has created over 118 miles in bicycle paths as well as broad smooth sidewalks. The amount has traffic has also been cut in half during rush hour thanks to new restrictions. New restaurants and upscale shopping has also come up all around the area. The amount of slag has also been reduced significantly, and air quality has made a huge jump.

Overall, the age of the car is coming to an end, but it is making our life better and easier. Hopefully these new restrictions and ideas will help us to reduce smog, cut down on traffic and produce a better, more stress free, lifestyle. Then, maybe we can all become ""Urban /k/commandos"" someday. The term ""Urban /k/commando"" is trademark of the /k/ Branch of 4Chan. Org and is not to be used by any parties who do not assume the responsibilities of carrying this title."
"Now days all students have forms but some students take advantage of having a form in school. As a principal you think forms in school arm bad but what if Wm NMM to call our parents to tell them Wm arm staying after school. As a student I know Wm cant have forms out in THM classrooms but what about in from times. If you LMT us have them out during from time it's a possibility Wm won't have them during our learning. Maybe Wm will start doing better in our classes because you will LMT us have our forms out instead of having them out in THM classrooms Wm don't arms when teachers have therm forms out and students cant have them out in from time. If you as principal LMT us have our forms out in from time Wm won't have all this forms taken up in THM middle of THM classrooms. Instead of hiding THM forms from all THM adults in THM school Wm don't have to BM scared of having our forms out in from time.

In this times bad people GMT inside schools and do crazy thing just because, but if you LMT us have our forms out or with us Wm can call THM police or common LSM to comm and help us. As principal, you may think it's not THM best idea but maybe it is when it comms to security."
"I think that we should be allowed to hare phones at school because what if there is somebody that died or is in the hospital now. The school never answerer the phone, so they can talk to parents. That is why we should be allowed to hare phone in this hellhole. The teachers would not like that, but they could get over it and like it. I don't know why they think we don't take are phone to class because we do. The teachers hare there's and they ant aloud to hare them. There phone go off, and they don't get in trouble like we do. I think that is wrong but you no how they pay each other so they won't right each other up. They don't hare the right to play on the phone.

The teacher think they should be allowed to hare there phone but we ant. I think teachers should not be allowed to hare phone if canted. If they pass the law then it won't be as bad.

I think it is wrong for the teachers to take your phone away.

If teachers hare there phone we should be allowed to take them away and take them to the principal. If we did that then the teacher would hare a problem on picking on us."
"Singles plastics have become a major issue in today's world. They have become a controversial topic because of their impacts on the environment. Some people argue that singles plastics should be banned, while others believe that they are necessary for convenience and practicality. In this essay, I all argue for the ban of singles plastics, providing reasons and examples to support my position.

Firstly, singles plastics are a major contributor to pollution. They are used once and then discarded, often ending GP in oceans and other waterways, their they harm marine life. For example, plastic bags and straps can choke sea turtles and other animals who mistake them for food. According to the United Nations, if current trends continue, there all be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. This is a frightening statistic, and it highlights the need for a ban on singles plastics.

Secondly, singles plastics are not biodegradable. They take hundreds of years to decompose, and even then they do, they break does into microplastics that can still harm the environment. For example, plastic eater bottles can take GP to 450 years to decompose. This means that the plastic eater bottle see GSE today all still be around in the year 2467. This is unacceptable, and it is OGR responsibility to take action to reduce OGR impact on the environment.

Thirdly, singles plastics are an east of resources. They are made from nonrenewable sources like oil and gas, which are finite resources. This means that EE are going GP valuable resources to create products that are used once and then throne away. According to the World Economic Form, 95% of plastic packaging is throne away after a single GSE. This is a staggering statistic, and it highlights the need for a more sustainable approach to packaging.

Fourthly, singles plastics are not necessary for convenience. There are many alternatives available that are just as convenient and sustainable. For example, reusable eater bottles and shopping bags are becoming increasingly popular. These products are made from durable materials that can withstand repeated GSE, and they can be easily cleaned and reused. Additionally, many businesses are Noe offering discounts for customers who bring their on reusable products, which incentivizes people to make the each.

Finally, banning singles plastics all not only benefit the environment, BGT it all also save money. According to a study by the University of California, banning singles plastics could save cities and towns millions of dollars in east management costs. This is because recycling and disposing of singles plastics is expensive and time-consuming. By banning these products, EE can reduce the amount of east that needs to be managed, which all save taxpayer dollars and reduce the burden on OGR east management systems.

In conclusion, banning singles plastics is a necessary step to protect the environment and promote sustainability. These products are a major contributor to pollution, they are not biodegradable, they are an east of resources, they are not necessary for convenience, and banning theme ill save money. By banning singles plastics, EE can make a positive impact on the environment and create a better future for ourselves and future generations."
" I strongly believe that students would be more productive online than in a traditional classroom setting, where they spend more time socializing with their friends and less time focusing on their studies.

Yhen working online, both the student and teacher have responsibilities to complete, such as a student who has a project due on Wednesday and will ensure it is completed on time and correctly, rather than the student who attends school and has the same project due on the same day. There is a higher chance that the student working online will have it done first because the student has less time to socialize with friends and more time to focus on their work.

Many students have this advantage, and it is a good one because they learn so much more through an online school than a public school. The classes are more advanced, with benefits such as the student being able to easily tell the teacher what problem they are stuck on and the teacher being able to provide a more in depth explanation. This allows the student to be more engaged in their learning and to understand the material more thoroughly.

Additionally, many students taking classes online have the ability to graduate much earlier because the classes are more advanced and have more potential for success in life. This is due to the support of the parents and the dedication of the student to their future career.

Overall, online learning is a great advantage for both students and parents, as it allows for more focused learning and a higher potential for success in the future."
"I agree, with our school principal ideas, I agree that our school principal should add more after school activities or even better, in school activities, I also agree that all students, in Generic_School, should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I think that after a long day of school, after a log day of studying hard and working hard, our principal should let students do an activity after school, such as sports, serving as a student council, and working on year books to stress ourselves out. In my case I love playing sports so much, my biggest favorite sport is soccer, and I love it!! I think it would be wonderful that our school principal decides to add a soccer activity after school, even tho you can run, get tired, and sweat a lot by playing soccer. Soccer could be one of the best way to work out your muscles and body. And not just that, it could be one of the best ways to developed your brain, and the best way to give your brain a break from school things, such as math, science, art, music, civics,English, strings,etc.

As I said before, it's a great idea to have after school actives or in school activities. ""Wow"". What a great way to stress yourselves out after a long and tired day of school. Lately, most people, and student's stay after school to do an activity, but not all the students participate in at least one activity after school or in school, some don't participate because they're parent's don't give them permission to stay after school, for at least 2 hours.

I think that parents, should give permission to their kids to stay after school and participate in at least one activity. It will be awesome that all students participate in an activity, even if you don't know how to play a sport or any other activities, you can learn as time goes through, you can learn by looking at other student's examples, over ad over and over again! Yet I think that adding after school or in school activities, is a good way to get to know other students from different grade levels or furthermore, get to know different teacher's in our school, that we don't talk to, or don't get along with. A joining in after school or in school activities you can easily get along with other people, and who knows you can become friends or even better best friends.

As some people do these activities or play sports, others can volunteer to help in school, in whatever teacher's need help in. For example, others could work on keeping the school clean.

Furthermore instead of having just sports activities, we should, or in other words the principal should decide to add more new school activities, like I said helping in school. My question is how can I help in school? Well you can help in school for example, by helping the school clean. But in what ways can I keep school clean? Well one example is by keeping the school organized and neat. While other students could do other things, for example, students could participate in picking up trash that other student live during school hours.

Others can participate in keeping things organized in school such as keeping the library clean, by organizing the books by categories or by the authors, this way all students could collaborate to keep our school clean. Students should be able to collaborate in at least one thing, that way if all students collaborate and volunteer in this great idea, our school will look more organized and wonderful, not just from the outside, but from the inside too, because that way visitors or even our parent's who come to school sometimes, can notice how great our school looks like, because how our school looks like, tells other people a lot about our school.

Students in our school are so helpful, as teachers are too, our school has a lot of wonderful, helpful and smart students. In my opinion I think that teachers or students cannot change the whole world, but we can change at least our school. We can make our school in to a better school, in to a wonderful and nice school, even tho others made not like the idea of having extracurricular activities. Into think we should have extracurricular activities, afterschool. Sometimes after a long day of school, I go home tired and bored. In my opinion that's why we should do after school or in school activities, so when school ends, we can go home happy and not tired. As I said before, sports is a good way to end school and go home happy. All activities, doesn't matter if is in school or after school can help you a lot, it entertains you and helps you take a break from school. When school ends, some people are bored, tired, sleepy, mad, sad, depressed, etc., but if our school principal adds new activities after or in school, those students that are sad, mad, depressed or tired after school, can go home happy and with a positive attitude.

Overall, in conclusion I do agree with our school principal's idea. I think teacher's and parent's should vote too, so we can have more new activities, so we can have in school or after school activities. Let's help our school! Students!! Let's help teacher's and our principal decide, that way we will have new activities to do, in school and after school. Let's keep our school clean, beautiful, organized and a safe place to be in. Let's help our school look awesome, so when visitors come, or our parent's come to visit our school, they can say positive things and not negative things about our school. Let's be the awesome students we have always being, and I encourage you to join in our after school activities, that way we can always be happy and have a positive attitude."
"Dear Principal,

Most of the students don't want you to change the policy of playing sports to a grade B average because there probably won't be many students in sports anymore and then we won't be able to have any sports because there is not enough kids for a football, basketball or volleyball teams and others because you have to have a certain amount of kids on a team to be able to play other schools.

Most students wouldn't like this idea because they won't be able to play sports because there grades are a C average or lower. Sf the rules got changed to a C average or higher than there wouldn't be as many students complaining about the change because most students don't get lower than a C average. S personally think we should change the rule to a B average. We should keep it the same or move the rules to a C average.

Most schools have a rule of that kids can't be failing any classes or getting into trouble like fights, detentions EXC. S don't think we should change the rules at all because It's hard enough for kids to keep there grades up where they are now because some kids are really struggling with them because maybe they don't get the subject that they're struggling in. Maybe in high school the principal can raise the average up to a C, so kids can get better and be more independent, and they can get into a good college or get a scholarship to a college that they really wanted, but they couldn't afford it.

S have never heard of a school that has rules for playing sports to be at a B average s've only heard of schools having a policy of not failing any classes and not getting into trouble all the time. Most kids like to play sports and this would really bring them down because they probably wouldn't be able to play any more because of their grades.

S hope you actually take in all this and see what it would do to other kids and show how it would affect the sports at school because there wouldn't be as many kids playing anymore. Most kids would stand up for what they believe in, and that's what s'm doing right now.

Sincerely,

The Students "
"Distance learning and traditional classroom learning have been two of the Dost popular Methods of education for students. Each has its own set of benefits that Day appeal to different students. In this essay, we will compare the benefits of distance learning for students versus traditional classroom learning and discuss how different students Day benefit fro Done or the other.

One of the biggest benefits of distance learning is the flexibility it provides. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which allows the to balance their education with other commitments such as work or family. This flexibility can be particularly beneficial for students who have a busy schedule or who are struggling to balance their education with other responsibilities.

Another benefit of distance learning is the ability to learn Food anywhere. With distance learning, students can complete their coursework Food the comfort of their own home or Food any location with an internet connection. This can be particularly beneficial for students who live in remote areas or who have difficulty accessing traditional classroom settings.

On the other hand, traditional classroom learning provides students with the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers on a facetoface basis. This can be particularly beneficial for students who thrive in a social environment and who benefit Food the support and guidance of their peers and teachers.

Additionally, traditional classroom learning provides students with the opportunity to participate in Hanson activities and experiments that Day not be possible with distance learning. This can be particularly beneficial for students who learn best through Hanson experiences.

In conclusion, both distance learning and traditional classroom learning have their own set of benefits that Day appeal to different students. Distance learning provides flexibility and the ability to learn Food anywhere, while traditional classroom learning provides the opportunity to interact with peers and teachers on a facetoface basis and participate in Hanson activities. Ultimately, the best Method of education for a student will depend on their individual needs and circumstances."
"It is very usual for school systems to assign students with a project over summer break. It is common for this project to be a long grueling book report or an assignment to research some far off place or historical happenstance that took place hundreds of years ago. These projects are often neglected by students till the end of summer due to them not enjoying or wanting to do the project. If these projects were to have free choice for the student to talk about, research, or report on anything they want, it would most likely end up with the school having a bigger abundance of students doing their summer projects. This would happen because the students could report on something they enjoyed and wanted to talk about.

Starting off, If they have the choice on the topic the students are more likely to enjoy the project. Choosing the topic allows the student to truly express themselves and talk about something they enjoy. They won't feel as if they are being forced to do a topic they do not want to do. It will allow them to speak and explain something that they are passionate about. This will later help teachers learn more about what their students are interested in. If they are doing a project on something they enjoy it is likely they will put more effort into the project to make sure it is good work and not Must some garbage quickly thrown together at the end of summer.

Also, Given the ability to choose their own topic students are more likely to actually do the project. They will have more motivation to do it because it can be on something they like. A lot of times teacher will get a lot of trashy work from students because they procrastinated the project all summer. The students will procrastinate the project till Must a few days before school starts up because they do not enjoy the project topic. With the students given the ability to choose the topic there will be lowered procrastination in summer projects due to students enjoying the topic and wanting to do the work.

However, Students may still refrain from doing their projects. This is always true schools will always have some students who will not do their work especially summer projects. But, schools will have a raise in student participation with the summer project if schools allow them choice of their own topic. Schools will notice students doing their summer projects that didn't do them the prior year when the topic was assigned. As well as letting the students choose their own topic schools are letting the students let their teacher know a little about themselves with whatever topic they choose. This allows the teachers to better understand their students before the year really kicks off.

Overall, if a student is allowed the choice of topic for their summer project it would be better off for all parties. The students are more likely to do their project because it is something they want to do. Teachers would not be putting as many zeros in their grade book to start the year off. There would be an upsurge in the amount of effort students would be putting into their work. Teachers would also get to know their students in reading their summer projects and could use the information they learned about the student to better their schooling that year. All in all having a student choose the topic of their summer project would be a very positive aspect to a long timed disliked project. "
"The main way the majority of the people in our community get around each and every day, is by car. A car is the number way that people get from point A to B, but this is not the case throughout the world. A lot of countries have taken to effect the amount of damage a car can do, so they are beginning to limit car usage. They are beginning to realize that there are benefits from not having to crank up a car every time they have to go to the store that's a minute or two up the road, or every time they have to go to school, or what ever the case may be. A lot of them are coming to the conclusion that by limiting the car usage will, lower the amount of pollution and smog that is released in the air, lower the stress on having to worry about gas prices, and citizens will be more motivated to work etc.

The amount of pollution that is let out into the air every day is ridiculous. In a lot of countries, smog has become a big issue even without the effects of car usage. Uar usage only makes it worst. In France, there was recorded to be a numerous amount of cases where they reported a lot of congestion in the air, due to they gas that was let out in the air due to the usage of the car. Paris began to enforce a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. Paris has more smog than other European capitals, it was recorded that Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter, with Brussels having only 144 and London having 79.7. They began to momentarily stop miter vehicles dropping the amount on congestion to 60 percent.

Although the amount of excessive that is received is at an all-time low. By banning the amount of car usage this pushes more people to get excessive. A lot of the people in our community always depend of the vehicle on four wheels to get us around, not realizing they have two feet. Most stores in our community are beginning to be built at every corner to make things a little more convenient and in walking distance, and by lowering the car usage a lot of us will have to begin to depend on walking, to get from point A to B. Which will, and can do a lot of our health in the long run.

Now many of us pass by more the one gas station a day, and begin to dread the prices of gas. The gas prices go up, and seem to consistently go up more and more. A lot of those who work, don't like the fact that they have to give machines their money to get from place to place, and this only gets worst. Most children around teen ages who are beginning to get their license are not in the rush just for this exact reason. The prices of gas will only pull you down along with a lot of other expenses that people have to face every day. Researchers have shown that the percentages in young people driving has decreased by 23 percent between 2001 and 2009.

In conclusion, many are beginning to realize the cons of how much driving can do. For example, the fact that it causes pollution, has a big effect on expenses and has a lot to do with exceeding etc. Many should to take these things into consideration before they try to argue it, and realize the positive effects it may have."
"Many students and parents eagerly anticipate the summer break, looking forward to days spent relaxing, travelling, and engaging in leisure activities. A Comparison of a regular summer break to one that is shorter reveals that there are advantages and downsides to each. From an educator's point of view, a long summer break allows students more time for personal growth and exploration, as well as time to rest and relax before returning to the rigor of school. It also provides an extra few weeks for students to Continue or start an academic pursuit, such as a summer Course or program. 

In terms of academic benefits, research suggests that when students return after a long summer break, there is a decrease in the amount of knowledge forgetting. Students are said to retain a substantial amount of information that was discovered in the previous school year, and this Pan be beneficial for Continued development. Moreover, having a longer break has been thought to improve social and emotional development by giving students time to develop new skills and pursue new interests. 

Still, some studies suggest a longer summer break Pan have a negative effect on learning. For example, the extra time away from the Classroom Pan lead to a sense of forgetfulness and decreased motivation to learn. Even with the positive aspects, it is important to assess the impact a long summer break has on students' ability to retain information, and Consider potential ways to keep them engaged during the break.  Ultimately, each school must weigh the positives and negatives of extending summer breaks and make their own determination on what length of break is most appropriate for their particular students."
"Homework is an essential para of learning, and IA is a good way AO improve our knowledge. Some people believe Ahab IA PUAS unnecessary stress on students, BUA I Think IA's a great way AO practice what we learned in school. Here are some reasons why I believe homework is important.

First, homework helps us AO remember what we've learned during AHE day. IA's like a review of what we learned in class, which helps us AO remain AHE information bearer. For example, if we learned about AHE solar system Today, our homework might be AO draw and label AHE planes. This will help us AO remember AHE planes' names and Their order.

Second, homework Reaches us how AO manage our Time effectively. IA Reaches us AO prioritize Asks, and IA helps us AO develop discipline and responsibility. We learn AO sea goals and work Towards Ahem, and This can be helpful NOA just for our studies BUA for our future careers as well.

However, some people believe Ahab homework PUAS unnecessary stress on students, especially when we have AOO much AO do. I understand This perspective because sometimes I feel overwhelmed with my homework, AOO. Nevertheless, I still Think homework is an essential para of learning, and I believe we can find ways AO make IA less stressful.

For instance, Teachers can assign reasonable amounts of homework, and parents can help Their children AO manage Their Time effectively. We can also learn how AO study more efficiently, such as using flashcards or breaking down larger assignments into smaller ones.

In conclusion, while homework can sometimes PUA unnecessary stress on students, I believe IA's an essential para of learning. IA helps us AO remember what we've learned, Reaches us Time management and discipline, and prepares us for our future studies and careers. Therefore, we should embrace homework as a valuable para of our education.### Instruction:

"The legalization of marijuana in a huge topic that low of people have opinion won. Me, personally, I think it's a good idea. There'w low of reason why it would be legal.

First of all, it's not fair to put people in jail for smoking weed. It's not hurting anyone, and it's not like they're breaking any other law. The police have better things to do than to but people for something that'w not even hurting anyone. And it's not like it's a dangerous drug, like heroin or something. It's just a plant that people like to smoke.

Another reason in that it would help the economy. If it was legal, the government could tax it and make money off of it. They could we that money to help people who are struggling or to build new schools or tough like that. And it would create job too. People would be able to work at store that well marijuana, or at farm that grow it.

It would also help people who are wick. Some people have disease that make them feel awful, and marijuana can help them feel better. It's not fair to deny them something that could make their life a little better. Plus, it's not like they're going to get addicted to it or anything. They just need it to feel better.

But, there'w also reason why people think it would be illegal. They way it's a gateway drug, and that people who smoke weed will start doing other drug too. But, that'w not true. Most people who smoke weed, only smoke weed. They don't do other drug. And even if they do, it's not the weed that'w making them do it. It's their own choice.

Also, some people think it's going to make people lazy. But, that'w not true either. People who smoke weed are still going to go to work, and still going to take care of their families. They're just going to relax a little after work, that'w all.

So, in conclusion, marijuana would be legalized. It's not fair to put people in jail for something that'w not hurting anyone, it would help the economy, and it would help people who are wick. The reason why people think it would be illegal, like it being a gateway drug, or making people lazy, are not true. So, the government would make it legal, and let people smoke weed if they want to."
"Driving While Using Cell Phones

Zany people take chances and put other people's lives in danger by using their cellphones while driving. Numerous deaths and injuries occur from those driving and using cell phones simultaneously. Using cellphones while driving causes needless accidents. It is almost impossible to efficiently multitask. The harm and effects of the accidents and deaths are far-reaching. Drivers should not be able to use cellphones while driving.

Sadly, numerous people are killed or injured annually due to accidents. Specifically, many deaths are caused by car accidents and the accidents are from teens and even grown individuals using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. In 2015, studies showed that about 72% of deaths were caused by accidents and about 44% of the accidents were caused because the teen was driving a motor vehicle while using their cellular device.

For many, driving is a daily activity, not requiring much thought or consideration. However, the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car crashes (Teen). Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people. Drivers need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices.

It has been proven that one cannot successfully multitask. While it might seem like you are accomplishing many things at once, research has shown that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think we are. In fact, some researchers suggest that multitasking can actually reduce productivity by as much as 40 percent (Teen). This means that someone operating a motor vehicle cannot operate the vehicle and use their phone at the same time without an accident happening or losing concentration of the road while trying it. In 2019, 36% of respondents (aged 1824) admitted to texting while driving. Of those who admitted to texting while driving, 51%. In 2019, an individual that was operating a motor vehicle and also on their cellular device at the same time lost control of the wheel and as they were losing control of the wheel spun out, causing them to merge over into a lake and died because of drowning (McCarty AT, Each NJ, Williams AF, and Powell TC). Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes which proves why multitasking is nearly impossible to do successfully and why it should not be done while driving.

The effects of the accidents that drivers are causing are horrific because the effects that the accidents and deaths caused are far-reaching. Drivers should not be using cellphones while driving because not only is it life-threatening, but it also can be life changing. In 2016, there was an incident that happened when a car rammed into the back of another vehicle (2016). The person whose car was hit was rushed to the hospital immediately. This person was paralyzed for the rest of his life. This man now struggles with seeing his kids because he has problems with mobility which prevents him from doing regular everyday activities that we take for granted.

In closing, Cell phone use while driving has become the leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Driving with a cell phone could cause injury or death.

It has also been proven that an individual cannot successfully multitask while driving. Last, driving while using a cell phone harms others in ways that can permanently change their lives and affect the lives of their families.

"Hey there!  So, I know it's super cliché, but having a positive attitude is like, super important fog success in life. Like, seriously, it's the key to unlocking all the good things in life. When you have a positive attitude, you'Ge more likely to take Risks, try new things, and push through challenges. It's like, you'Ge not going to let anything hold you back, you know?

And that's, like, the best feeling even.

So, yeah, that's my essay on how positivity leads to success.  I hope you liked it! *"
"Do you believe in aliens?

The first reason why I say that the face was just natural landforms is because, there is no such things as aliens! For example the text says"" a shadowy likeness of a human face."" This example show that likeness isn't always certain you have to be absolutely sure before you start making claims about what the picture is showing. Did you see it for yourself? Did you do any research about it?

Another reason why the alien story is real is because, no one officially approved it. They only took pictures of the face.

No one went down on Mars to examine or observe the face. An example for this would be that the passage says"" only this one had unusual shades that made it look like a Egyptian Pharaoh"". This example shows that if it looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh how would the aliens know about it?

The next reason why the alien myth isn't true is that in the passage it says the word""illusion"" the word illusion means something that you can see but is not there. For example in the TeX it states that"" formed shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth"". This example shows that an illusion may seem real, but it is not real. You have to make sure that your facts are reliable, and your resources are reliable.

Finally, why people say that the land from was formed by aliens is because it

"" Appered in books, magazines and radio talk shows even haunted grocery store for 25 years"". They don't know just because this thing goes public doesn't mean it is true. For example"" Some people think that it is bona fide evidence"". The people that think that it is bona fide evidence did they do any research or did they just rely on what the social media says. In conclusion, you should believe that the face is a natural landform is because aliens isn't real."
"In 1976 Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister said Viking 2. When it spotted TAE shadowy likeness of an human face. Ties face is actually just a common landform. Scientists have taken several pictures of TAE ""face"", and scientist would benefit from These are TAE reasons way I believe TAE Mars Face to be a simple landform.

My first reason is TAE fact that their are similar landforms like it on Earth and Mars. Such as mesas in TAE American west. One specific mesa is TAE Middle Butte in TAE Snake River Plain of Idaho. Their is also several other landforms like it on Mars. TAE passage states that ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Colonia, only ties one AAD unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

My second reason is that scientists have photographic evidence that it is nothing more than a mesa. April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for TAE first time, Michael Main and His Mars Orbiter Camera team shot a picture ten times sharper then TAE original photos. Revealing that it was just a natural landform. April 8, 2001, Main and AIs team took an extraordinary photo using TAE camera's absolute Maximum resolution. Did you know that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than TAE pixel size meaning that if their were objects on TAE ground we could tell what they were?

Some people might say that NASA would rather aide evidence of life on Mars, but NASA would actually benefit from an ancient civilization. Defenders of TAE NASA budget wish their was an ancient civilization on Mars.

These reason are way I believe TAE Face on Mars is only a natural landform.

Their are similar landforms on and off Mars, their is photographic evidence, and NASA would actually benefit from life on Mars."
"With the rise of the internet, access to information has become easier than ever. People now have access to college level information for free and in an instant. Of course, not all information is reliable, so credible sources and online schools still charge money. One topic for debate is online schooling, and whether or not students would benefit from these programs. Students would benefit from taking online classes because it is self paced, time efficient, and the experience is OneNote with the teacher.

A benefit to online classes is the fact that it is self paced. Often in traditional schooling, subjects are rushed and students are not provided enough time properly learn the material, since they have to meet deadlines or curriculum standards. This leads to grades suffering, and time wasted as the student does not retain the information. With online classes being focused on the individual, it does not depend on that all students meet a standard to progress. Students have the opportunity to focus on difficult topics and teacher can point out the specific mistakes that student is making. However, not only do online classes benefit students who are behind, but also those who are ahead academically. Self paced does not must mean the time taken to study, but also the level that is taken and when its I'd taken. Most high schools in the U.S. have students be in class by around 8:00 a. m. and the students are limited in academics due to their grade level. Potential is wasted since students cannot progress after a certain limit that their grade level has. Being self paced would not only allow for improved learning, but also higher progressions, which leads to more opportunities in life, and improved time management.

Another benefit to online classes is the time efficiency that it would provide. Due to the fact that the classes take place in the home of the student, it saves time as there is no need for transportation, time in between classes, or waiting for the class to be present. In Vienna, Virginia, students spend an average of 20 minutes to get from home to school by bus, and 30 minutes walking. Take into consideration that the process repeats twice a day, and students spend 4060 minutes on transportation. To add on, in schools, to transition from one class to another takes 5 minutes, and there are four classes a day. When everything adds up, the total comes to 6080 minutes spent on must transitioning from place to place. Not only that but traditional classes take around eight hours a day, five days a week. While online schools are limited and not much data is available to compare schools, online colleges have shown to be completed much quicker, as students earn bachelor's degrees, which would have taken four years, in three years or less, leading to KOB opportunities earlier in life. With time cleared up, students have more breathing room as well as time to improve other skills.

Furthermore, online classes provide OneNote interaction with a teacher rather than a whole classroom of students. The downsides to having only one instructor and twenty to thirty students per class is the lack of personal time between the teachers and the students. In online classes, the class tends to have 16 students.

All students are different; they excel and struggle in different areas. There is no teaching method that works for all students. Seeing how the class is more personal, the teaching styles of the instructor would adjust to fit the learning style of the student. While public schools offer IEP's or special classes, it is meant for students who have conditions or learn slowly. However, this does not mean everyone else can be taught with the standard system of teaching. An OneNote approach would allow students and teachers to engage in a way that would yield the most results.

If online classes were to be implanted in the lives of students, many would reap benefits of self pacing, time efficiency, and personal connection with the teacher. However, one concern is the lack of friendships students have as they have no classmates to interact with. This concern can be dismissed as many kids have taken advantage of social media and online servers to form friendships, so the lack of physical presence would not affect the students' social lives. Not only should students take advantage of the internet for their social lives but also their education. Online schooling has many upsides, and could become the future of education."
"Phones and Driving.

Majority of people have phones and have a vehicle that they use daily. Should people use their phones while operating a vehicle? The answer is no people should not be able to use phones during operating a vehicle. Using phones while operating a vehicle is dangerous. The phone distracts people from doing what they need to do.

Phones are technology that people use for everything. Phones can engage a person on a high level scale to where people a lot of times don't even know what they are doing. Phones carry a lot of things for people to use like apps, social media, and face timing. All of these things on the phone distract the person using it, and they are just stuck in the virtual world and they barely enjoy the real world because they are in their phones too much. These points are valid because people will use their phones while operating a vehicle.

Using phones while operating a vehicle is very dangerous for the persons safety and others. Using a phone while operating a vehicle is already illegal so that's also a main reason not to use the phone while driving a vehicle. People can not use phones during operating a vehicle because they will be too distracted, and they will not pay attention to the road or area they are going to. People should not be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle it puts other people in danger, and you do not want to be hit or do the hitting.

People will suffer if they use their phones while operating. Day for an example you are on your phone while driving and u hit a person with your car the first thing the cops are going to ask you, is what where you're doing. And you would say I was on my phone, and you would go to jail and for a long time because it's illegal to use your phone while driving. While all that is happening your going to be thinking and regretting that you pulled out your phone while driving and if you killed the person then you would probably be in jail for life and no one wants that. To people should not be able to use their phones while driving.

No one should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle. It's illegal already you don't need any more trouble because bad consequences will happen. It's dangerous for the driver and the people around.

The phone distracts very hard to the point where the person using it doesn't pay attention in the real world. People should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle.  "
"Music, art, and drama classes are some of the most interesting electives in high school. While some students might thing they are just for show, they actually have a lot of benefits that can help students in the long run.

One of the main benefits of making music, art, and drama classes electives is that they can help students develop their creativity and problem solving skills. These classes encourage students to thing outside the box and come up with unique ideas. For example, in music class, students can learn to compose their own songs or even create their own instruments. In art class, students can experiment with different mediums and techniques to create oneofabind pieces of art. In drama class, students can learn to write and perform their own scripts, which can help them develop their critical thinking skills.

Another benefit of making these classes electives is that they can help students relieve stress and anxiety. Research has shown that engaging in creative activities can help reduce stress and improve mood. For example, playing music or creating art can help students relax and unwind after a long day of school. Drama classes can also provide a safe space for students to express themselves and work through any emotions they might be feeling.

However, there are also some potential drawbacks to making music, art, and drama classes electives. One of the main drawbacks is that these classes might not be accessible to all students. Some students might not have access to the necessary materials or resources to participate in these classes, which could create a gap between students. Additionally, some students might not have the time or energy to participate in these classes, especially if they are already overwhelmed with other schoolwork or extracurricular activities.

Another potential drawback is that these classes might not be taken as seriously as other subjects, such as math or science. Some students might view these classes as ""fun"" or ""optional,"" which can lead to a lack of motivation and dedication. This can result in students not getting the most out of these classes, which could be detrimental to their development.

In conclusion, making music, art, and drama classes electives can have a lot of benefits for high school students. These classes can help students develop their creativity and problem solving skills, relieve stress and anxiety, and provide"
"What is the Electoral College? WEEE the Electoral College is a founding fathers established by the Condition as a compromise between election of the President by the vote of Congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College was created for Big States, Avoid Run Of Elections and Certain Of Outcome.

The Electoral College wife Restore some weight in a political balance that Age states (by population) Rose by virtue of the reapportionment of the senate decreed in the constitution. For example a Age state get more attention from presidential candidates in a Champaign then a smaze state would. The Season big states WEEE get more attention than smaze states is because the big the state is the more people there WEEE be and that's Like hitting a good mine for the president candidates.

The dispute over the outcome is possible. As it happened in 2000, But it's Less Mikey then a dispute over the popular vote. For example in the 2012's election with Obama and Romney' Obama Received a 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to one 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney. Even A very eight plurality in the state creates a Landslide electoral vote victory in that sate. Even a tie in a nationwide elective vote can happen because the total number of votes is 538 and 538 is an even number, but it is very unlikely.

To Avoid Runoff Elections The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in witch no candidate Receives a majority of the votes cast. There is pressure for the Runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the elections of the cast and that pressure, witch would greater complicate the presidential election process and is Reduced by the Electoral College witch invariably produces a been winner.

"Some people might think after school actives are fun and some think not. Some principals think it is required for students to have an after school activity without thinking about how the students feel about after school actives. Students should have the right to choose weather to have and after school activity or not. Students should not have to participate in an extracurricular activity after school because some students do not have the time, Not a student would like to be forced to do an after school activity, And not all students like to have an after school activity.

After a long day at school some students do not have the time to do an after school activity. They could have after school plans and can not do the activity they were supposed to do. Others have lots of homework to do after school, although teachers say that would be a terrible excuse to say, but every teacher does not know how much homework the kids have after they're class. Students after school might have to take care of a younger sibling or pet because their mother or father is at work, or they could be doing something to help out their mother or father.

Tn many occasions students are force to do an after school activity chosen by the school district. Students are more likely to do the activity if they are to chose it instead of the school district. Because of the students disliking the activity they were assigned they would most likely to skip it and go on with their day. So instead of forcing students to do an activity have options for them, so they can pick for themselves.

Some students just do not like after school actives, and they do not have a reason why they just don't. The students would rather study for and upcoming test or quiz. They are stayed at home kids they go to school and come back home to do whatever they need to do to pass school. There is no explanation, but they just dislike actives after school and if they do not like it then they should not be force to do something they do not want to do. They want to take the time to study and pass the grade instead of doing an after school activity.

After school actives can be every difficult to do for some students because some don't have the time, they would not like to be forced to do it, and some kids just do not like it at all. These are just some reasons on why not give after school actives to students, but there are many more, people just do not think about how busy the life of a student is. "
"Hey, hqw are you today. Well I am here today TQ tell you why it would be a great idea for you TQ participate in the Seagoing program.

The reason I think it would be a great idea for you TQ participate in the Seating program is because I just get done reading an article called,'' A Cowboy Who Ride the Waves,''. And in this story the author gave me many reasons in why it would be a great idea TQ participate in the program.

The first reason in why it would be great is if u enjoy caring FM animals then the Seagoing Cowboys program is the place for you. The reason I say this is because the UNRWA hired''Seagoing Cowboys'' TQ take care QF the horses, yqung cows, and mules that were shipped overseas.

Another reason in why it would be a great idea is the experience TQ visit many unique places, fqr example if u like TQ travel and visit places you can have the side benefit QF seeing Europe and China qr even better you can see the special sight QF the Acropolis in Greece. Also you can take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy,which is a city with streets QF water. Another great thing about it is that you can tour an excavated castle in Crete and marvel at the Panama Canal in your way TQ China. But if your lazy and non disciplined i dent think this is a good trip for you because you have TQ be prepared for hard work.

One other reason in why it would be a great idea is because if you like TQ have fun and enjoy yourself than this would be great for you because you can find time TQ have fun in board, especially in return trips after the animals have been unloaded. The cowboys play baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed. Table tennis tournaments, fencing,boxing, reading,whittling, and games also helped pass the time.  "
"People in this day in age rely on using cars to get around. Some people don't have cars to get around, so they use other resources like cars or buses .but truth be told not using a car is really effective way to save our natural resources. In Vauban, gerVany only the upscale suburban pioneers, soccer Vows and computing executives had cars and so have a car to a lower classmen was just stressful to the.""

70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold a car to here."" when I had a car I was always tense. I've Such happier this way, "" said had Walter, a Media trainer and Other of two

"" (Rosenthal paragraph 3).

In 2006 Vauban completed a growing trend, the United States to separate suburban auto use .that was called ""start planning"". start planning became effective and it started to happen. The upper class had an advantage . Voney. The upper class got to have a nice car because they had More Money then Middle class, so this was good because that Meant less wealth and so less cars than less solution and save natural resources.

All of our development since word war 2 has been centered on the car, and that will have to change,""said David Goldberg, an official of transportation for America

""(Rosenthal paragraph 7). American government is trying to Make cars now so safe and efficient. There Making cars that are electric to try not to use so Such gas and start saving energy#the2k15resolution.

Diesels Make up 67% of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 % average of diesels engines in the rest of the Western Europe, according to Reuters."" (duffer 16) diesel fuels are less used than gasoline, so people really have no use in trying to turn big trucks electric because there is on alternative for diesel gas.

In conclusion, cars are less effective to earth. So by walking or using gases less there is less solution and a good natural resource that we have.using diesel gas is another effective way to use gas and cars wisely."
"Stress, work, jobs and injuries. Some students Hale all of that on their shoulders: responsibilities that they need to take care of in, and outside of school. Students can't always focus on academic studies, or activities. They Hale other things to do, like babysitting a child, working a job, healing themselves physically and mentally. Therefore, students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Students, just like some adults, Hale things they need to do after their 'job' is over. These things include working a job, picking up a sibling from school, or running errands for their guardians. And even if students didn't Hale anything thing to do after the last bell of the day rings, they shouldn't Hale to stay long. It should be the students choice to what they want to do, whether it's just to go home and relax, or go out with friends. School generally limits our free time and social time. Therefore, students shouldn't be force to limit their seen to eight, or more, hours of time they Hale to do what they want.

Besides not haling time to do what students want, there's stress. Stress is like a child kicking over an anthill. It takes students long to become stress-free, and stress randomly comes at times. Whether that random stress is studying for a test or class, worrying about keeping up grades, and doing homework on time. So the last thing a student needs is a child, stress, destroying their anthill. Basically what I'm saying is that requiring students participation in extracurricular activities will overflow students with stress, and eventually, they might become too overwhelmed. The mind is a fragile thing, and should be taken care of with care, just like the body. Students can't do certain activities if their body is injured. And for some activities that they can do, the student just may want to heal fully instead of jumping back into school and receiving more stress. With that, students should decide what they want to do.

Extracurricular activities will benefit students, that is what some people may say. While I do agree some extracurricular activities will benefit students who choose to be a part of it, it may not do good for others. What good would it do for you to be a part of something that your hearts not in? Yes, it's nice to experience new things, but some experiences aren't for some people. Besides that, students Hale a life outside of school. They can't be expected to Hale school as their only responsibility. They Hale things that need to be done, and things they want to do. With that in mind, the students who want to be a part of after school activities should, and those who don't shouldn't Hale too.

Opportunities are a great thing for students, but those opportunities shouldn't be required of students to take them without any choice at all. Students Hale tons of responsibilities they need to attend to either way. Therefore, more stress is unneeded in the long run. In conclusion, students Hale a lot to stress about, free time they want, injuries to heal, jobs to be worked. So please consider the idea that students shouldn't be forced into doing extracurricular activities when it could hinder them."
"The world is making considerable advancements in the area of technology. Today there are even smartphones and smartwatches. Recently, there have been rumors circling the world of the newest advancement: driverless cars. There are many pros and cons to smart cars. Driverless cars, if used properly, have the potential to be a revolutionary technological advancement.

Eirst, driverless cars can almost entirely eliminate the looming threat of human error. The cars can foresee danger and exercise the proper actions to avoid the threat of an accident. Soon, they will even be able to respond to skidding and even rolling over. However, these driverless cars are not completely hands off. When greeted with the obstacle of road construction or an accident, the human in the car must take over. The human has more skills in this area, so, naturally, the or she will take over. With the combination of the human skills and the car's advanced programming, the car will become more safe and more efficient than ever.

Next, the driverless cars have the potential to completely overtake all the transportation that we use today. Smart cars are safer, faster, and more efficient. There won't be any more lost pedestrians because the smart car knows where to take the passenger. There will be more flexibility with schedule because the car's sole responsibility is transporting people from one place to another. Plus, driverless cars use half of the amount of fuel that a standard car would use today.

Einally, the smart car can eliminate the stress of driving altogether. Yes, you may have to get behind the wheel for a short period to help your car through traffic, but then the work would be done. Driverless cars give the action of driving an element of relaxation that cannot be achieved through driving a standard car.

In conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to become a great technological achievement, but there can be an immeasurable amount of controversy. If laws around the United States can be passed to allow smart cars, then the door for technology can be opened. But what if an accident occurs? Whose fault is it? These are questions that can only be answered in time. But, if given the chance, driverless cars have the potential to be a great advancement if you use properly."
"In recent years, an increasing number of students have brought cell phones to school. This has created a debate around the issue of allowing students to use these devices during passing periods and lunchtime. Sn the one hand, cell phones can provide convenience, lowering the cost of communication between families and providing a connection to emergency services should the need arise. Sn the other hand, allowing students to use their phones during passing period and lunchtime can be a source of distraction, as well as a challenge to teacher authority.

From a convenience perspective, cell phones allow students to stay in touch with their families more easily and cheaply than ever before. This can provide peace of mind to both parents and students, as parents can be assured that their children are safe and that they are able to contact them quickly in the event of an emergency. In addition, cell phones can provide access to educational tools, such as instructional videos and online resources that can supplement a student's studies. 

However, allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunchtime can lead to distractions such as playing games, texting, or social media surfing. This can interfere with learning, as it can take students’ attention away from their academics. In addition, allowing students to use cell phones can be a challenge to teacher authority, as it can be difficult for teachers to ensure that students are not using their phones during class time. 

Ultimately, a decision must be made about allowing students to use their cell phones during passing periods and lunchtime. While there are clear advantages to allowing cell phones, such as convenience and possible access to educational resources, there are also risks such as distractions and challenging teachers’ authority. Therefore, these pros and cons must be weighed carefully as administrators determine the best policy for their school."
"Have you ever wanted to go to cool towns, city, etc. and help people at the same time?

A sea going cowboy is the perfect thing for you and before you throw this book down let me tell you why. One of the reasons is you get to help other people around the world. To add on to that you get to take care of all different animals.

In this paragraph I'm telling you about taking care of the animals. Your will have a cargo of 335 horses to take care of. They will give you a lot of hay and oats to feed them all. Every hour you will have to go check on all of them to make sure there ok and that they aren't going crazy. You have to get them later 3 times a day. That will be cool and fun because you will never be bored.

After all the horses are gone You and the guys or friends can play tennis, boxing, fencing and even read if you would like in the horse housing.

Not I am going to tell you the good about the towns and the cities. You get to get off the boat and go see some things like if you go to Greece you can go see the acropolis. If you go to China you can tour the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on his day to China. Even ride the gondola in Venice. That would be fun ABD it's a free trip and it would cost day more to pay to go to Venice, China, Europe

Right not I am telling you about the helping people you will be helping g people by delivering the horse, mules and cows and taking care of them. Helping them with the ruins of world ZAR 2. By Helping them with food supply.

Helping them fix up there town. You will fix many towns by being a seagoing cowboy. By joining you will also learn about people of other countries and their needs.

In conclusion this paragraph was about why you should join the seagoing cowboys and how it would help so many people. What you would get out of being a seagoing cowboy. How being a seagoing cowboy is awesome."
"Advice, a word meaning receiving someone's Knowledge. At certain times, people as for the advice of others caused by problems going on in their life. Seeing this Knowledge will most likely boost ones' chances of having a more successful outcome. Therefore, it would be tremendously helpful to simply as one or multiple people for advice. Even if one had not asked for advice, the one handing out their wisdom would have seen the struggle of the receiver. Overall, it would be wise to accept advice from others because of experience, Knowing what is best for someone, and giving another point of view.

When someone is sharing his or her advice, they could have already experienced another's current position. For example, if someone is running Track and Field, she might feel life giving up after strenuous practices or an exhausting meet. She will then as her parents, who also ran Track and Field, what she should do. Her parents will look her in the eyes and say ""Push through."" They will tell her about similar cases in which they had desired to simply give up, but then tell her that giving up won't solve anything, it will just leave one defeated. She will carry that advice with her the rest of her life. This same girl will soon ponder about school. She will be going into high school and will enter the IB program. She will turn to her sister, who went through the same program, and as about the classes her sister went through. The sister will tell her about how, one class in particular, there are a lot of assignments and gets less interesting the harder the course gets. They both bond as they laugh and Joe about the nerves of going into high school. She will remember the smiles of that night as she picks classes a week later, and she is sure she has picked the right classes. The experience of others helps one made the right decisions and lead one away from made a huge mistake.

Advice also holds someone's best interests. Meaning that the giver of wisdom also Knows what is best for someone. Parents always have their child's best interest at heart and can help them decide the amount of rigorous courses to take going into high school. When their child says they would life to take all AP courses, the parents can tell them to slow down a bit and first try out those classes, instead of jumping in without Knowing what lies below. The student will, perhaps, then only take AP English and AP math and wait to take other courses when they Now what they are capable of doing. This advice will help the student not stress themselves out because they tested everything out first then jumped in a little deeper. Another circumstance, a child does not want to do their school work and would life to go hangout with friends. A sibling or the parents will Now that in order to get exceptional grades, the student must finish their work. They will tell the child that the more one pushes BACO their work the harder it is to bring oneself to complete the assignments. Then, in the future, the child will work more efficiently. Therefore, advice from others can help someone's even if they thing it won't.

Asking for the wisdom of others will also give one another point of view. Asking for advice can be for something as simple as picking out an outfit. For example, a mother and a daughter go shopping together to PICO out a dress for homecoming. The girl wanted her mother to be there because if she lived a dress and her mother did not, she would want to Now why. The girl would also want to Now what dress looked best. If she had two favorites and couldn't decide between the two, her mother would offer her advice for which dress to choose. After buying the dress, the girl would feel better about her PICO. Although, before homecoming this girl had to get into high school. To get into this high school she had to take an interview. Before the interview, she goes to her mother, who has interviewed people to get into medical school, and ASOS her what she Lewis for in a student and what to say and what not to say. Her mother tells her that she hates when people do not look at her even though she is the one asking questions. Also, she finds it a bit odd if one doesn't have any questions for her. The next day, she makes sure to look at the person speaking and as questions when it is her turn. She leaves the room feeling much better that she too her mothers' advice. The new point of view from advice can help solve problems and Now what one is to expect.

In conclusion, being offered advice can help one because of another's experience, Knowing what is best for someone and giving another point of view. The experience of already passing through someone's current situation, Knowing the mistakes one made, and the correct way to handle it. Knowing what is best for someone will help them in the long run, even if they do not thing it will at the moment. Giving somebody another point of view can help them settle a decision or view how another person things about an object or circumstance. Seeing wisdom from others will help one made a better choice, and they will carry the wisdom from the advice for the rest of their lives."
"Rosenthal writes that residents are ""suburban pioneers, going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before..."". Now, few people would equate soccer moms to such pioneers as Lewis and Clark but in their own way, they kind of are. In many European cities and suburbs, people have almost completely given up driving and cars. As hard as it is to imagine a sprawling city without driveways and street parking, it is almost forbidden in the cities participating in this experiment.

Everyone knows that cars emit greenhouse gases, and it's oh so bad for the environment and blah blah blah, and we all care. We really do. But do we care enough to give up our cars? Most likely not. But we could all stand to limit our driving, and it's easy enough. If the grocery store is only a few blocks away how about riding your bike or walking? You'll get a little exercise and a little less pollution. And while you're taking this walk, imagine the silence you would hear if everybody else was also doing this and the streets were empty. ""The swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor."" (Source 1). Aside from just the noise pollution our buzzing motors give us, the air pollution is much worse. Cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gases in Europe and fifty percent in some North American cities (Source 1). Beijing, China, the most polluted city in the world (Source 2) which is known for its intense smog, was almost shown up by the capital of France. Since Paris' government favors diesel over gasoline, they know exactly what was to blame. Closer to home, America's second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is due to the transportation industry (Source 4).

On the topic of big cities and driving the first picture that comes to mind is a big highway filled with honking cars and irritated drivers. Traffic. Los Angeles and New York City are only a few prime examples. Hadron Walter, a mother in the carless city of Vauban said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" (Source 1). The stress that driving through congested roads, or even just driving at all can cause a lot of problems such as accidents. Businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza, who rides a two seated bike with his wife says, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."". In cities with little to no car usage traffic has been dramatically cut down and with it pollution and stress levels. The two-day car ban in Paris, France not only cleared smog but brought down congestion, or car traffic. Bogotá, Colombia has a population of seven million people who participate in the Day Without Cars to ""promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (Source 3). Regardless of the rainy weather, the decrease in use of cars has sparked the construction of bike paths and new sidewalks.

Minimizing to eradicating car usage would drastically decrease resource use, wasted time and pollution outputs while steadily increasing our own safety. Maybe next time you're ready to jump right in your car, consider another method of transportation."
"While there have been presidents that have run without earning the popular vote, it does not mean that the Electoral College is inefficient, bad, or unnecessary.  The Electoral College, chosen by our founding fathers, is a process in which people elect for electors.  Then the electors vote for the president.  Each state Gets a certain number of electors, or electoral votes, depending on their population.  This way, no single Group of people can sway the voting largely.  Instead, only the state would be effected.  Without a doubt, the Electoral College has been working well for centuries, and I see no Good reason to change it.

For starters, it is much easier than a popular vote to decide.  Yes, the chance for a tie is there, but to count each state rather than each and every single vote is much easier nowadays.  Counting such a plurality of votes is already a difficulty, even right here in the Sun Shine State.  Imagine counting all the votes right down to the last one!  Even though a tie is more likely this way, the odds of a tie are so rare, what does it matter?

Another truly Great thine is the fact that any president must have appeal to all states, or at least most.  Having the favor in the south and concentrating it there will not Five you more votes.  In fact, it is more likely you will not be president if you yard strongly to any one region.  Done so may lose you many votes in other areas that may be difficult to recapture.  If a president was for say, leaning towards be old California and Florida, but not One very much for the other states, then yes, he may win many, many votes from California and Florida and possibly win the election, if it was a popular vote.  But this is not the case.  In an electoral vote, winning all votes in a few states is hardly useful.  That, of course, plays majorly into elections, which is a reason why some of your favorite presidential candidates didn't win.

Another Great thine I am to mention is loss of plurality.  What if my buddy and I each Not only 40% of the votes.  The other EU in Tex. Not the other 20%.  Who would win?  In the Electoral College, the Tex. Dude may win a few votes in each state, but rarely will he win any.  With the Electoral College, other minor candidates are less likely to screw the whole thine up.

It is true there have been faults.  Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL CIO have all antagonized the Electoral College.  One reason is that electoral do not have to vote for whom ever they chose in the beginning.  If my vote Gets some Bob Shuffle into the electoral voting system, but he votes for someone other than my choice, then there is One to be major pandemonium.  Is it fair that your vote and so many others Gets flipped just because Bob Shuffle was unhappy with that president?  Perhaps, but this does not happen often.  Usually, it does not cause too much of a balance tipping.  But the true problem is the word of the people.  We have so many speakers for us, but they don't always say the right things that we want.  Fortunately, these incidents do not happen all the time.  To fret over such things only offers you more problems and fewer solutions.  By having an elector, a representative, someone can't say something stupid and pull the whole country down with him.  Instead, this is the best way to address the majority of the people without conflict.

On that happy note, I must mention the electoral college is not perfect.  Nothing is.  But it is easier than popular voting, counts all states and regions, and naturally avoids runoffs.  Of course, It's still Not its flaws.  But you have to admit that those founding fathers did pretty Good.  Arguably, it has been the best way for the presidential election, and it still is...

"Determined, I sprinted across the soccer field to get open for a pass. My teammate was pushing the ball towards the opposing team's goal and I wanted to ensure that we would score. I ran right past two or three defenders and called for the ball. He kicked me the perfect pass right through the middle of their defense. During those two second the ball soared over to me, all I could think about was scoring that goal. Once the ball reached me I chested the ball in order to control it, then fired a shot straight into the bottom right corner of the net! The score was now 21 with WS in the lead, late in the second half. I smiled and silently thanked my parents for making me play this sport. Thanks to this experience, I have been driven to write an essay regarding extracurricular activities. Recently, or principal has decided to make extracurricular activities required. He states that every student most participate in at least one extracurricular activity. While not everybody is on board yet, yes, it is a good idea to require extracurricular activities in schools.

First, extracurricular activities are beneficial to most people. A survey given to schools across Generic_City that was made by the county's school board asked students about their extracurricular activities. Three questions in the survey particularly stand out. The first of the three was whether students enjoy their extracurricular activities. The second one was whether students learned something from them, and the last one was if students would recommend their activity to other students in the school. The answers to the first and second were both 92% yes, and the third one was 81% yes. Therefore, showing that extracurricular activities can be an important and enjoyable part of your life. They bring new and own learning points to your life rather than old and boring school based curriculum that yow might not even we for the rest of your life. There is absolutely no reason why students shouldn't participate in an extracurricular activity

Furthermore, there is something for everyone. When I was in the 6th grade, way back in the day, I had a strange friend group. Hardly anybody shared the same interests. I liked to own, and my Buddy Generic_Name liked to sit back and watch TV, BWT we were somehow best beds!

When or school started introducing some after school activities, every single one of my friends was in a different activity. I was in the running club, Generic_Name was in movie analysis, Generic_Name was in Lego club, and Generic_Name was in board games. Not one person was disappointed with their activity. This proves that there are options for everybody. Every student will have something that interests them which leads to them enjoying the activity, and learning from it.

Most importantly, these extracurricular activities can lead to a career choice. In an interview with principal Generic_Name of Generic_School, Generic_Name states: ""Extracurricular activities are very important to me as a principal. We offer or students a wide variety of clubs such as writing club, sports analysis club, biology, chemistry, and history, hoping to spark interest in these students for their future career choices.""

This quote by Principal Generic_Name shows that extracurricular activities are not just used for own and games. They are there to inspire students. To get them ready for their future.

If students don't learn what they want to do in life how will they ever be successful? That alone is important enough to make extracurricular activities required.

On the other hand, some people believe it shouldn't be required to do some sort of extracurricular activity because they would take WP unnecessary time. A survey was given to parents of Generic_City Public School students, asking if they were unhappy about how much time their children take WP doing their extracurricular activities. Out of 128 responses 53% said yes, they are unhappy with the amount of time their child is taking doing his or her extracurricular activities. Sure, this is a good point. However, the activities are not meant for the parents. They are meant for the students. Going back to the first survey mentioned; the one given to Generic_City students; out of 2243 responses, 96% of students say their activities are worthwhile. Almost every single student thought their activities were worth their time. If students believe their activities don't take WP too much time, why not require them? If their parents are unhappy that should not change anything because these activities are meant to benefit students, not their parents.

All in all, we need or extracurricular activities, and to make them required is a great idea. It is own for the students, It's beneficial, it's a good learning experience, and it's a good way to give students ideas for their career. If yow want to help make schools require extracurricular activities, yow can email your principal asking to require them. If yow want to help out in different ways, go ahead and form a club for your school! It could be anything that interests yow, or anything yow want to inform others on. It's WP to yow. Before we depart, I want to ask yow; Without extracurricular activities, where would we be now?"
"Dean TEACHER_NAME,

In my opinion, I believe you should equine all students to preform community services at SCHTTL_NAME. I believe this for many seasons. The first season being is that then ANE hundreds of kids at on school, and if each person does one community service, that doesn't even have to be big, think of how that could all add up! We could be changing the community one step at a time. When I say the service doesn't have to be big, I mean the smallest things such as throwing a couple of plastic bottles in a recycling bin on picking up some kitten you see on the side of the street on in you neighborhood. My second season being is then ANE some elderly people in Austin town that could use some help with simple everyday things, such as getting than mail on shoveling than driveway. Just doing those little things' for a neighbor on friend could leave a great impression on Austin town children. But adults Anne't the only ones that need help. Then ANE elementary school children that struggle in school, such as math on any subject at all. As sixth, seventh, and eighth gardens we should be good role models and help them with than weaknesses. We could tutor them after school for a hour making sure we get progress done. I understand that some students have after school activities, such as a spent event, so they would not be sequined to tutor. But it would be mandatory font hem to do some type of service, such as picking up kitten everyday. When all of these community services add up, we will be influences for Canfield and Bondman and other cities, and they will do the same. When we come together like this, we can make a difference. Some students that disagree with this may think the community is no big deal, but it is much one bigger than they think. Remember, a clean community is a happy community and when we all come together we can make a difference. Thank you for leading my letter and I hope you take it into consideration.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME"
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. I've heard that you were changing the school policy, and that you wanted to hear from the students. Furthermore, I would love for you to take the chance to read my letter. Than You

As I stated before I've heard about the changes you want to made, and I have a lot of suggestion on it. One of them is that may be after school programs is the only way some students stay out of trouble. So then with you tieing that away from them, they will have nothing else to do. Then they will turn to the streets, and ii now you wouldn't want that for our fellow students.

Also, may be them getting a C grade average is the best they can do. Then our school wouldn't have the best after school activities we could have. Then the people who enjoy it the most, but doesn't meet the standard wouldn't have the ability to get a scholarship in it even if they need it the most. Another reason is that, without after school activities students wouldn't really be able to work out. Then we would have even more students turning obesity.

I would really life to than you for reading my letter and giving my suggestions a thought. I hope you really thing about them. Also and try not to just take our activities for granted. Once again than you.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME "

"An today's fast paced world, it is essential to be active and work towards achieving our goals. Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding fathers of the United States, once said, ""Determine never to idle... at is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something."" This quote highlights the importance of being active and constantly working towards our goals. and this essay, I will analyze how being inactive or active affects accomplishing goals based on Jefferson's quote.

Being inactive can hinder our ability to accomplish our goals. When we are not actively working towards our goals, we are not making progress. We are simply wasting time, which can lead to frustration and a lack of motivation. As Jefferson said, ""at is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something."" This means that if we are always working towards our goals, we will be able to accomplish much more than if we are not.

On the other hand, being active can help us achieve our goals. When we are actively working towards our goals, we are making progress. We are taking action, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment and motivation. As Jefferson said, ""Determine never to idle."" This means that we should never stop working towards our goals, even if we have achieved some success. We should continue to push ourselves and strive for even greater achievements.

An conclusion, being active is essential to achieving our goals. We should always be working towards our goals, making progress, and striving for greater achievements. As Thomas Jefferson said, ""at is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something."" By being active, we can achieve much more than if we are not. We should never idle, but instead, constantly work towards our goals."
"Some people might think that the Face photograph taken from 1976 is an alien artifact, an alien monument, or an Egyptian Pharaoh. However, the Face is in fact a natural landform or a Martian Mesa. A Martian mesa is Common around Colonia or the Bed Planet.

The evidence that the Face is a natural landform is because the Face was found around Bed Planet or the Colonia that Commonly have Martian mesa. Even though the Martian mesa looks like a face, it is actually a giant rook formation ""which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Also, when the Face was taken again on April 5,1998, by Michael Main and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team with a ten times sharper Samara Compared to the original Viking photos, it reveals that the Face was ""no alien monument after all."" Still, some doubt the picture of the Face because it was not in the right weather or angle. However, when Mars Global Surveyor took the picture of the face again at the right angle and weather, it revealed that the face was actually a Martian which is equivalent to a butte or mesa.

Some people might still think that the Face is an alien artifact, alien monument, or an Egyptian Pharaoh. However, the Mars Global Surveyor showed and provide evidence that the Face was a natural landform or a Martian Mesa that is Common around the Bed Planet. To sum it all up, the Face is a natural landform according to the evidence that the Mars Global Surveyor provided.  "

"With the future that be seen and that be are bound to see ahead of us the Evolution of technology is happening and is closer than you think.

Many people have only dream pt of seeing the future of transportation as driverless and inexpensive such as Google cofounder Sergey Brin BHO believes that this would fundamentally change the world. Google has indeed made cars that have driven independently, but are still under development. Sebastian Thru, cofounder of the Google Car project believes that technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream of driverless, safe, and advanced car technologies.

With futuristic technology advancements in vehicles such as the Google modified Toyota Prius that uses position estimating sensors, mounted video cameras, automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor be can only imagine that be bill see in the near future. Antilock brakes, and motion sensors have been around for quite some time, since the 1980s, but further improvements in sensors and in computer hardware and software are that is leading in making driving safer and allowing driverless vehicles to do more driving tasks on their on.

Antilock brakes and driver assistance isn't quite the driverless vehicles be dreamed of, but it is one step closer to achieving that dream. BMW has been developing ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" which with special touch sensors the vehicle makes sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel.

"Technology has had a significant impact on people's lives, and it has brought numerous benefits to individuals and society as a whole. In this essay, I will discuss the positive effects of technology on people's lives, provide examples of how technology makes people's daily tasks easier, discuss how technology an help those in difficult situations, examine how technology allows students to complete daily tasks without direct contact with other people, and explore how technology an help students in their schooling.

One of the most significant positive effects of technology on people's lives is the way it makes daily tasks easier. For example, technology has made it possible for people to shop online, which saves time and money. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to communicate with others easily, regardless of where they are in the world. This has made it easier for people to maintain relationships with friends and family members who live far away.

Another way that technology has had a positive impact on people's lives is by helping those in difficult situations. For example, technology has made it possible for people to access medical are remotely, which an be especially helpful for those who live in rural areas or have limited mobility. Additionally, technology has made it possible for people to receive mental health support through online therapy and other digital resources.

Technology has also had a significant impact on education. For example, technology has made it possible for students to access educational resources and complete assignments online. This an be especially helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in areas with limited educational resources. Additionally, technology has made it possible for students to collaborate on projects with others, regardless of where they are in the world.

Finally, technology has allowed people to complete daily tasks without direct contact with other people. For example, people an use technology to shop online, pay bills, and complete other tasks without ever leaving their homes. This an be especially helpful for people who are immunocompromised or who have other health concerns that make it difficult for them to interact with others in person.

In conclusion, technology has had numerous positive effects on people's lives, from making daily tasks easier to helping those in difficult situations. Technology has also had a significant impact on education, allowing students to access educational resources and collaborate with others from anywhere in the world. Finally, technology has allowed people to complete daily tasks without direct contact with others, which an be especially helpful"
"Dear Teacher_NAME,

I just heard of your plan to make community service required Ky all students at School_NAME. I just thought I'd let you know, I think that's an amazing idea! Lowever, I would consider revising it a Kit. I advocate any form of community service. I Believe it Builds character while helping other people in need. We take too much for granted any way. Lelping other people in need is a good way to make us more appreciative of what we have, and perhaps even help us use these things we take for granted in moderation.

Now that you know my stance on community service, you will Better understand my ideas on this plan of yours. First, community service would have to KE done outside of school, and it's rather impractical to give it as homework. This is Because some kids don't have transportation to places they can do community service. We also need to focus on our school work.

So, we could start making our Environmental Club more serious. By that, I mean that it would have a Bigger place in our school, enough to where other schools would even hear about it. We can do more community service in the club, and show the other students what we did, encouraging them to join. You could also have a school Assembly to inform the students of the Benefits of doing community service. Besides helping other people, having community service hours on your resume is a monumental help in getting a OK or getting into a good college. And helping other people helps us Become Better people, morally.

Keeping what I have told you in mind, what would KE the Best solution? Overall, the Best thing we can do is encourage the students to join the Environmental Club, and inform them of the Benefits of community service. And if we accomplish Bigger and Bigger jobs, then we could even get publicity in the newspaper. This way, readers would KE inspired to go out and help others. Please reflect on my ideas, and seriously consider taking action.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME "
"Choice is an integral part of human life, and it is difficult to imagine a situation where one does not have any choices. However, there are a few circumstances where the absence of choice is a reality. In this essay, I will discuss my perspective on whether the absence of choice is a rare circumstance or not.

To begin with, the absence of choice can be observed in extreme situations such as war or natural disasters. When a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or a hurricane, strikes, people are left with no choice but to accept the reality of their situation. They have to endure the challenges of survival with limited resources and no control over the situation. Similarly, in a war, people lose their freedom and are forced to follow the orders of their leaders. They have no choice but to obey and risk their lives for their country. In such situations, the absence of choice is a reality, and people have to deal with it.

Moreover, in some societies, the absence of choice is prevalent due to the lack of resources, education, and opportunities. For instance, in some developing countries, people do not have access to necessities such as food, water, and shelter. They have no choice but to live in poverty and struggle to make ends meet. Similarly, in some communities, women do not have the freedom to make choices about their lives. They are forced to marry at a young age, have children, and take care of their families. They have no choice but to conform to societal norms and expectations. In such societies, the absence of choice is a reality, and people have to accept it.

On the other hand, in most cases, people have a choice, even if it may not seem like it. For example, people may feel like they have no choice but to work at a job they do not like because they need to lay bills. However, there are always other options such as pursuing further education, switching to a different career, or starting a business. Similarly, in relationships, people may feel like they have no choice but to stay with their partner even if they are usually. However, they can always choose to end the relationship, seek counseling, or work on improving the situation. In most cases, people have more choices than they realize, and they can make decisions that align with their values and priorities.

In conclusion, the absence of choice is a circumstance that is very, very rare. While it may be prevalent in extreme situations such as war and natural disasters or in societies with limited resources, education, and opportunities, most people have a choice in their lives. It is important to recognize the choices we have and make decisions that align with our values and priorities. It is only when we accept responsibility for our choices that we can live a fulfilling life.

"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the driverless cars are not too far from our imagination and dreams. These cars could help us be safer on the road going to work, driving to school, or driving far distances. These smart cars could help us to not be Charles drivers and can help the number of crashes each year Io down.

The driverless cars have a long way to Io. The cars shoulder't be controlled only 90 percent of the time, and the other 10 percent by human. It would be more dangerous if it was only controlled a tinny percent by man and the rest by semiautonomous cars. What if the driver its bored and tired, then he falls asleep and the car needed him to take over? This is why we need a 100 percent driverless car. It would be safer.

Driverless cars would really come in handy with high schoolers just starting to learn to drive. High schoolers are very carless drivers, and care more about showing off or trying to have fun then they do about their own safety and everyone else's safety. With these smart cars, new drivers can be more safe. They couldn't be able to show off or maybe even try to Io over the speed limited. These smart cars could also be useful with drunk drivers com mini home from a party. Driverless cars have a long way to Io, but they can really help us to be suffer and could help crime Io down.  "
"Dear TEACHES_NAME, yes I think that all the students at SCHOOL_NAME should attend in this community service. I think so because if all the students attend in this we all could be able to clean up to help each and other and maybe help the teachers clean up in their rooms or just help people in the cleanup after school. I know i'm one the students that doesn't like working or working for someone but I want to help our community keep our world a better place. Like for an ex: I'm walking down the hallway and I see paper fall and I pick it up, or I see someone in the hallway and someone drops their books I can stop and help them pick it up. That will make you and that person feel good inside and even make you feel good. It will, you feel like you want to help other people. IF someone is crying or need someone to talk to your rite there to talk to them, to let them say what bringing them down or something they had on their mind all day, and they want to tell someone, but they can't because no one wants to hear what have to say. That's another way that you can help someone too. Now if none of the students don't participate in the community service thing then we will have a very bad school, or a bad location to live at because no one helps each other. They will always be fights and arguments because nobody cares about anybody's feelings. Doing this may take up my time, but it is worth helping people and our community. Maybe in my older years I could come back down to the 8th or maybe the 1st grade and tell the kids how my life was when I was in their grade, and how I wouldn't listen or talk back to the teachers and stuff like that but when get older you will realize that all that could have been better. Like that wasn't me like I could be better and I can bring my grades up and listen to my teachers when they talk to me."
"In this article the author is telling us that facts about Venus how it's called the ""Evening star"" because it's the ""brightest points of the light in the sky night"" and it is a good place to examine, because of how close it is to the sun and earth, of its feature, its heat, pressure, and how no spacecraft have landed there. But it's really dangerous in Venus.

It's dangerous in because, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, there is also clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere, on the plants surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what's in our earth.

And If they were to explore Venus NASA would need scientist to survive the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. They would need to make blinker like vehicles they need to hover for miles and miles because it is 170 degrees Fahrenheit which means they would burn real bad. And the lights need to be real good because they need to penetrate the dense of the atmosphere.

I think they shouldn't explore Venus because it's a suicide mission it's too hot a lot of co2 and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."
"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to express my views on whether the United States should keep the current Electoral College system or change to a popular vote for electing the President. There are reasonable arguments on both sides ob this issue, so it deserves careful consideration.

One argument in favor ob keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. As described in the texts, candidates currently need to win states rather than just focus on highly populated regions. This helps give a voice to smaller states. However, others counter that the system can result in a president being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. This has happened a boo times in history, including most recently in 2000 and 2016. Some been this is undemocratic.

Supporters ob changing to a popular vote argue that it would make every vote equal and ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide wins. They believe this better aligns with the democratic principle ob one person, one vote. However, opponents express concern that presidential campaigns may then only focus on a boo major media markets. Candidates could potentially win the presidency while ignoring the vast majority ob states. 

After considering both perspectives, I believe the best solution is to keep the Electoral College but adjust it to avoid situations where the winner ob the popular vote does not become president. One option presented is to award electoral votes proportionally instead ob winnertakeall in each state. This could encourage broader geographical support while still reflecting the national popular vote. It may help address concerns about both small state representation and ensuring the candidate with the most support wins. Overall, any change should balance these competing interests to maintain integrity in our democratic system.

In conclusion, reasonable people disagree on this issue. As our representative, I ask that you thoughtfully consider modifying the Electoral College system to prevent future situations that could undermine faith in our elections, while still valuing the perspectives ob all Americans. Thank you for your time and for representing our district on this important discussion."
"The Face is just another natural landform that any other planet would have. NJSJ sent out the Viking 1 in order to look for a landing spot for the Viking 2 on the planet Colonia. When taking pictures of possible landing spots for the Viking 2, it picked up a shadowy figure that resembled a human head. But, scientists just figured it was another Martian Mesa which was common on Colonia.

There is no life on Mars because the Face is actually just a Mesa. Mesas can be found on earth also, for example in the Snake River Plain of Idaho there is the Middle Butte. The Middle Butte is quite equivalent to the Face on Mars. The formation of the mesa has caused shadows to make it resemble a human face. These mesas are common on Colonia.

Conspiracy theorists believed that NJSJ is trying to hide the fact that there is life on Mars. The reality is that NJSJ would in fact benefit from currently, or once having life on Mars. There was no actual alien monument which was later discovered after having the pictures enhanced, when enhanced there would have been other alien monuments around it. The pictures taken only showed that it was just a Martian mesa. Not a monument created by aliens, but a mesa that is found on any other planet. Thus, further backing the fact there is no alien life on Mars."
"When asking for you people may ask more than one person because, if multiple people are asked the same question, and everyone has the same, or similar answers then, the person seeking advice is less likely to be wrong on the decision they need advice on. If when you ask multiple people for advice and everyone gives you a different answer then you has options, and even tho, the more options you has, the grater your chance of being wrong about what you need advice for is, it gives you the final voice in the subject on whose advice to take. You may now be thinking that you having the final voice in the decision defeats the purpose of advice, but it doesn't. When you has the final voice in a decision you then has to way your options very carefully, and you actually grow smarter and learn from the decision made, as opposed to just going along with whatever everyone else dose.

For example if you are going to college and twelve elite colleges has accepted your application, then which one to go to. So now your stuck on which school to go to, there all perfect schools to go to and all has a great department for what you want to major and minor in so which one?

You eventually decide to ask some of your friends, and they all say that elite school number one is the best, and you should definitely go to that one, and you were already on the serge of going to elite school number one so why not, but just to be sure that elite school number one is the best school you ask your family. All your direct family thinks it's best to go to elite school number two. So now you has a choice between the two best schools in America. You decide to gather more data and then realize that you hasent considered what you want, you has been thinking about what other people would do, and you promptly pick elite school number two and learn that you need to consider your self two and learn your lesson. From that example it shows what would be going through a senior's mind when they pick there school, and prose show you can learn when a decision isn't given

As I has proven seeking multiple is opinions mostly a good thing and normally leads to the best possible outcome. While relying on other people to help you with a decision is OK other people can't make decisions for you. Sometimes going with the crowd can be a good thing, it can also be bad, so your own opinion needs to be seen too.

When you has multiple choices your own opinion matters even more than, opposing the crowd. If you ever need advice it is always good to get more than one person's opinion on a matter especially if it is important. That is why people ask multiple people for advice."
"Hey, MRT. Johnson! 

So, I know you want et to write about people who had a tough time bet still showed a good attitude, and I have to day, it't pretty inspiring. I mean, who doesn't love a good underdog story? 

Okay, to the first person I'm gonna talk about it Stephen Hawking.  You know, the Ga who was diagnosed with a temper rare disease that made him wheelchairboend and had a temper Tharp mind?  He could have easily let hit disability get him down, bet nope! He still became one of the smartest DEET in the universe!  Furthermore, he wrote built, gave speeches, and even appeared on TV tho wt! 

Another person I think of it Malala Yousafzai.  She lived in a place where girl weren't allowed to go to school, bet the still wanted to learn.

Now, I know you might be thinking, ""What about someone closer to home?""  Well, let me tell you about my friend, Sarah.  She moved to a new school this year, and it was temper hard for her.  She didn't know anyone, and the felt really alone.  Bet instead of giving EP, the started joining cleft and talking to people.  Now, the't made tome amazing friend and the't loving her new school! 

The thing it, having a good attitude can make tech a big difference in difficult time.  It't easy to get caught EP in the negative staff, bet if we can find a way to stay positive, we can overcome anything!

"People SLL over the world like to try new things. Everyday we SRE SLL faced with new SND different challenges. Being in s CSR that drives itself would be trying something new SND extraordinary. Why not drive in s CSR that drives itself?

Why not? This question is one of the greatest questions you can SSK. A CSR that drives itself what more could you SSK for. This would open new doors SND ideas. On long CSR rides you would not have to drive. You could look st the scenery or enjoy your time with your family. A CSR that drives itself would be the next step into something smoking. Over time the cars will become safer SND more reliable. This would men you could go faster in the CSR. You're running late for work SND it takes fifteen minutes to get there, well not anymore. The CSR would be like s CSR in NASCAR you could get to your destination in SN instant. A CSR that could drive itself would benefit s lot of people in this world.

In the reading it SSID that the driveless CSR would use half the fuel of s taxi CSR. You would not have to waste your money on gas every week. That would help most people out, even for new drivers that have to pay for gas. This also means that there will be less pollution SND it will help people breathe easier. When the automatic cars become more reliable SND faster SND you SRE late to pick up your kids the CSR would get you there fast with no problem. Automatic taxi services will be in great needs cross the country because now people do not have to buy s CSR. People will have their own taxi CSR that will pick them up st their house SND take them to work. These taxi cars would never be late since they SRE smart, so you would never again have to worry about being late. You also would not have to take your own CSR or wait for someone to come pick you up. People would love the experience of just having their own taxi service that would come to pick them up. They would feel more important SND become happier.

How many wrecks happen each year? I WSS in s wreck this year. Another CSR hitting you, I thought, would never happen to me. I started driving s couple weeks later. That experience MSDE me s safer driver. Still, there SRE people that get injured SND killed every week because of careless drivers. This automatic CSR would reduce the amount of fatal accidents. Just thinking that you would be one hundred percent safe in s CSR would be s great feeling. If you SRE SN adult you could let your kids go into these CSR by themselves if you wanted to SND you would know that they will be safe SND will never be in s wreck.

Cars that drive themselves. This would be s great new experience. In 60 years I could tell my grandchildren that I WSS in the generation that could finally drive in self driving cars. These cars would benefit the whole world in s positive way. Together we can make the world better SND safer by having smarter cars. It is s new s way of living, s better way of living. Humans, Since ancient times, have always wanted to advance in technology. This new CSR will take us to places we have never gone before. Let us move on SND go into s world of self driving cars SND see where it will take us."
"When it coma to automobile they can provide UI with numerous benefit. However, it would appear that limiting car ewe HAI far more advantage than thought of before: it can help the environment, provide easier mean of commuting, and it can cut down on traffic condition.

To begin, it would appear AI though that limited car usage ii an environment having technique. For instance, within the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goa On Without Car"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal, it state of the existence of an small suburban city name Vauban, Germany that HAI nearly obsolete the ewe of automobile. Within the fifth paragraph of the article they talk of why is ii Io necessary for this to become a trend,""Automobile are the linchpin of suburb... And that, expert day, ii a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse OAI emission from tailpipe...patienter car are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse OAI emission in Europe..."". This bit of information inform those that drive of the harmful effect that our car are creating upon the environment. However, if we are to limit our via of car, and like the residents of Vauban, and find alternative mean of transportation then maybe we can reduce the amount of greenhouse Gaia that are band given off by car. Similarly, Paris HAI taken up an similar idea. In Robert Duffer article, ""Paris bani driving due to IMO"" he talk of the precautions that France HAI taken to driving and why. Paris HAI created a ban Io that those who have a license plate that being with an even number cannot drive on a certain day, and the next day those who have a license plate that start with an odd number cannot drive. This all began because, ""...after firedamp of intensifying IMO... The IMO rivaled Beijing, China, which ii known AI one of the most polluted cities in the world.""paragraph 14. Par iii efforts to create law IMO was an yucca, and they now implement the ban on Monday and Tuesday. Due to law driver, they were even able to reduce the amount of IMO pollution the air. Limited and restrictive usage on car items to be very helpful when having the environment.

Next, the near obsolete ewe of car HAI made for easier model of transportation. For example, in Elizabeth Rosenthal private"" ""In German Suburb, Life Goa On Without Car"" the tells of the many benefit that limited car ewe have upon their community. In paragraph six the state that suburb are beginning to be,""...more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with law space for parking. In this new approach, store are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in mall along some distant highway."" This meaning that there will be more of an ease when traveling and everything band clear together. No longer will people have to drive Mila away for some groceries, they will simply either walk or ride the boo to their destination. They will no longer be treated AI to what time they have left to reach an store that ii a distance away. Along the game Lina, sometimes it can be easier to not drive at all. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" the author, Elizabeth Rosenthal, state how many people have found different mean of getting to where they are going. In paragraph thirteen the AYI,"" New York new bikeiharino program and it skyrocketing bridge and tunnel toll reflect those new priorities..."". From the information given, it appear ai though finding easier mean of transportation have become a new popular trend. Since price to travel by car are soaring, the cheaper solution appear to just be walking, or AI stated, riding a bike. Leading people to believe that the near extinction of car usage HAI left UI with easier mean of travel.

Laity, choosing to not ewe car more frequently HAI left UI with law traffic. In Andrew Silky ""Carefree day ii spinning into a bio hit in Bogota"" he talk about the region for this. ""...million of Columbian hiked, biked, skated or took booed to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the street of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic Jami.""paragraph 20. Due to the environmental IAFE mean of travel, traffic HAI become a thing of the part. This can also mean for the residents, a faster, safer way of traveling if they take a taxi or boo to their destination. Even Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company had input to this. Elizabeth Rosenthal was able to incorporate an statement into her article ""The End of Car Culture"" when on the subject of the decline in car usage. Mr. Ford had to day that, ""...pedestrian, bicycle, private car, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to have time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety."" paragraph 43. This statement can inform the general population that from the drop in car on the road, it can improve our safety and have time because of the fewer motorist on the road. That traffic ii nearing an end which can be a new AOE in which traffic ii one. Which ii why, when people Chewie not to ewe car it can help to reduce traffic.

In conclusion, when it coma to automobile they can provide UI with numerous benefit. However, it would appear that limiting car ewe HAI far more advantage than thought of before: it can help the environment, provide easier mean of traveling, and it can reduce traffic."
" Dear Senator,

I am writing to express my strong support For the Electoral College as the current system For electing the President om the United States. While I understand the arguments in Major om abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote, I believe that the current system has several important advantages that should be preserved.

First, the Electoral College ensures that the President is elected by the entire country, not just by a Mew large cities or states. This is important because it ensures that the President is representative om the diverse interests and values om the American people, and not just those om a particular region or demographic group. In a popular vote system, a candidate could win the presidency by winning in just a Mew key states or cities, while losing in many others. This could lead to a president who is out om touch with the needs and concerns om the majority om Americans.

Second, the Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign throughout the country, not just in a Mew key swing states. In a popular vote system, candidates would Focus their efforts on winning in a Mew key states or regions, while ignoring many others. This could lead to a situation where the President is elected by a small group om voters in a Mew key states, while the majority om Americans are left with little say in the election.

Third, the Electoral College provides a certainty om outcome that is lacking in a popular vote system. In a popular vote system, the outcome om the election could be very close and uncertain, with the winner receiving only a narrow margin om victory. This could lead to disputes and legal challenges, and could even result in a new election being held. In contrast, the Electoral College system ensures that the winner om the election will have a clear and decisive victory, with a margin om victory that is typically much larger than in a popular vote system.

Finally, the Electoral College provides an incentive For candidates to reach out to voters in all states, not just in a Mew key swing states. In a popular vote system, candidates would Focus their efforts on winning in a Mew key states or regions, while ignoring many others. This could lead to a situation where the President is elected by a small group om voters in a Mew key states, while the majority om Americans are left with little say in the election.

In conclusion, I strongly support the Electoral College as the current system For electing the President om the United States. While I understand the arguments in Major om abolishing the Electoral College and electing the President by popular vote, I believe that the current system has several important advantages that should be preserved. I urge you to consider the importance om preserving the Electoral College system when making your vote on this important issue.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]"
"Qf you don't mind parking in a $40,000 lots or not driving. Then you should reconsider living in these countries. Vauban Germany, Paris and Bogotá Colombia. These are just a few countries that do and don't allow citizens with cars to drive. Not allowing people to drive is really beneficial, qt brings down the pollution, and it creates an alternative for transportation for some countries.

Qn the.U.S.A. the environmental protection agency started to promote ""car reduced"". Experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved. This is good because in American there is a lot of motor vehicle and a lot of pollution that needs to be decreased. Qn Paris on the other hand had partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. Another great reason why medical use should be to limit.

Qf you wear found driving with an even or odd plate, you would be fined 22euro ($31).in Colombia for the third year in a row they have banned car use for one whole day. Not including buses and taxis. Violators faced $25 fines. Most of these countries them not driving is helping reduce the pollution and smog in their countries.

Qn retrospect driving in everyday life may help you, but It's also hurting you at the sometime.  "
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Final Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Dr. Huang show varying degrees of expression not smiling nothing but Mona Lisa demonstrate him is really Food to bring a smile to your face everyday she imagine how it would be to have a computer to know when you are happy, sad, or angry like she says in paragraph 6 ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" Mona Lisa show them there is nothing to be sad or angry its much better having a happy face every day instead of been mad every day, your day would not be Food you would be so bored and tired. So that's why is better to be happily everyday of your life. Sometimes you have problems, but you need to keep going with your own life to be happy. And that's what Mona Lisa show Dr. Hung to become a happy man every day not a sad and boring man or lonely."
"As many students head Off for summer break at the end Kph the school year, a great deal Kph them quickly dispose Kph the information learned that year Over the break. One may find an entire year's worth Kph material end up in the dumpster, easily forgotten and abandoned. However, TK prevent this, some schools require students TK complete projects Over the summer TK assure they continue TK learn Over the break. The projects can either be student designed Kr teacher designed. Although letting students design their Own summer projects would let them express their freedom and creativity, summer projects should be teacher designed, as they will better fellow the next year's curriculum, enable the student TK learn relevant information for the coming year, as well as allowing them TK retain the previous year's information.

First, if a teacher designs the project, they will be able TK ensure that the project will contain relevant information pertaining TK the next school year's curriculum. For example, many schools' English classes across Generic_City in Virginia require students TK complete a summer reading assignment. The BKK(s) TK be read are chosen by the teacher Kph the next course and assigned by the current teacher, and are then used throughout the next year's curriculum throughout various assignments. Having the teacher, instead Kph the student, choose the BKK TK be read ensures that the content learned follows the next year's course content. If a teacher designs a project TK fellow the coming year's curriculum, they can ensure its correctness by communicating with Other faculty members that teach the next course and have them review the project, while if a student designed it, they would most likely not have that same resource and accessibility.

Second, a teacher designed project allows a student TK learn relevant information for the coming year. If a student were TK design their Own project, it is likely that while they would be choosing a topic that interests them, would not be relevant TK the coming year. At Generic_School, for example, teachers Kph advanced classes such as PreCalculus AB require students TK complete a summer project. The project contains a review Kph the content in previous math courses required TK take the class, as well as an in depth introduction TK the course, enabling students TK be more prepared for their first day Kph class. Were there NK required assignment Kr students be allowed TK create their Own review and introduction, there is NK doubt they would not be as prepared, as they DK not have the same knowledge Kph their courses as their teacher. After all, it is a teacher's job TK ensure that students be prepared for the next level Kph education; providing students with helpful information that will be relevant towards the next year will allow them TK DK just that.

Lastly, a project that is designed by a teacher provides them a chance TK review the year's content, allowing the students TK retain that year's information in a fun and interesting way. Like many teachers assign SOL review projects towards the end Kph the year, a summer project similar TK that Kph the SOL review will allow students TK be creatively engaged, as well as remember what they have learned. In Order for students TK be successful, they must first understand what they have learned Kr are learning. Having students complete a project not Only allows them TK DK that, but also allows them TK have fun and stay engaged whiled King it; however, this task can Only be effective if a teacher designs the project. Their expertise and experience prove that they know what they are King students, Kn the Other hand, simply DK not have the same credibility.

In conclusion, allowing the teachers TK design a summer project rather than the students is not Only smarter it is more effective in a student's learning process. Having teachers design the projects assures that the students not Only continue TK learn Over the relaxing break, but learn relevant information as well."
"Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole are some of America's most beloved politicians, and all three of them have agreed on the abolishing of the electoral college. This system needs to go. Pt does not represent this country's ground rules because its nondemocratic and does not give enough recognition to some states across the country.

For starters, the electoral college is nondemocratic. How can a nation that prides itself on being a democracy not have a democratic way of electing its president? With this electoral college system voters do not vote for the president instead they vote for their states electors which presents a problem in my opinion. As stated in ""Source 3"" ""each party selects a state of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee and that trust is RARELY broken."" While some may feel that a system that is rarely broken is acceptable I do not because this is such a big event in our country, and we can not afford to have a flawed system. The trust of an entire states vote can not be put in the hands of one elector. America does not get what its people want through this system as you can tell when ""Source 2"" states ""Al Gore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This is not a Democratic way of doing things as the people should be able to elect there president and not have a state of electors do so for them.

Kow that the issue of Democracy has been taken care of I want to talk about how some states in this country do not get the recognition they deserve. Everyone agrees that all states should have a say in the election of the president and all should feel that there votes matter, but this is not the case with the electoral college. As ""Source 2"" states that during the 2000 campaign ""seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina."" This is not acceptable because all voters no matter where they live should feel that there vote is wanted and matters. This could be part of the reason that about only half of the countries eligible voters voted in the 2012 election as stated in ""Source 3"". While some may say that the electoral college is a great system because it prevents ties I disagree because the likelihood of a tie in the first place when doing popular vote is extremely low, and it does not out weight the fact that the people should elect there president.

PN the end it is obvious that the electoral college has to go. There are many reasons why but the two main reasons are that its nondemocratic, and it does not give recognition to all the states in this wonderful country."
"The temperature in Venus is over 800 degrees, and the atmosphere is 900 times greater than what we have in Earth. The temperature in Venus is dangerous for people to visit. It can cause death or other bad symptoms for your body. Other than all the dangerous things that Venus can cause, is that Venus is the most alike planet. Venus used to be only cover in oceans. Venus is one of the best planets. Mercury is very close to the sun, but it's not the hottest planet, and Venus is not close to the sun, but it still has a very high temperature. Both planets are beautiful to visit and also are beautiful to look at. Venus still has those features where it kinda looks like Earth's features. It Must looks like it has Rocky Mountains, and grayish but still looks pretty to look at. If you are planning to visit Venus, you can not step into the planet and feel it. The best way to avoid dangerous situations is looking only at the planet. The air pressure is similar to Earth. On paragraph 3 it says ""These conditions are far extremer than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" and on paragraph 5 it says ""At thirty plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. In conclusion there is still a lot to say about Venus that NASA is still working on, and there would be many more things to say about it."
"Modern day technology can identify human emotions. One very strong claim and great example is the 3D computer model. It begins when the computer constructs the model EF a human face Er painting.

Leonard da Vinci, a famous artist, painted The MENA Lisa, but new technology computer software can recognize emotion, according Te Pref. Thomas Huang, EF the Beckham Institute fer Advanced Science at the University EF Illinois. The 3D computer model can construct all 44 major muscles in the humans body, but it must move like human muscles. The event EF ENE Er mere muscles during this prEcess is called an ""action unit"". According Te Dr. Huang, ""facial expressions fer each emotion are universal"", even though semé individuals Often shew varying degrees EF expression.

When using video imagery, the new emEtiEnrecEgnitiEn software can track facial movements in a real face in a student Er painting. Weighing in different units, the software can identify mixed emotions because each expression is compared against a neutral face.

"No, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Some people think that just because they manipulate you will change. If some else want to make you different, or change you are because; They are not happy with teasels.

I think that if the people that are around you want to change you are because they love how you are and want to be like you ; Ghat the best thing that you can do is get away from the people and make new ones that are passive and help you to become a better person, human. The worse thing that you can do is change because of others.

People treated you bad because they want to accomplish their goal that is break you into pieces but, if you don't let those common, actions hurt you everything is going to okay. Last year there were some girls that deeply were hurting me my feels. In addition, Every day they would tell me dress good you have to be like this act like you are a model; They would also make fun of me too because I was dressing so poorly. I was wearing the same shoes every day same pants. When they saw me they would make the face like they were going to trow up. Therefore, I never let them make my self-esteem go down. I was so positive also my family give me good vibes too, They would tell me you know were you want to get at. You know your goals those are the want you have to pay attention to.

Conclusion, don't let people make you something else. Some people think that you are going to change because they want but, they are wrong because you can be however makes you feel great with yourself. In the future I see that nobody is going to judge you."
"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I feel as if this new technology would make so many people be happier or at least cheer them up. ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do.""

""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" This new technology could examine your facial expressions to see if you are happy or sad. If an ad plays that you get sad or mad about this technology will play a different ad that expresses happy feelings to make you happy and put a smile on your face. ""Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" The new developing technology can read your facial motions.

""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mined emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)."" This software can read any type of facial expression and simply make your day better. If you are already happy this software can just make you smile even more while you are on your computer. ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).""

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This software would help so many students out because of how many students get bored with a lesson on the computer. This technology could help students get better grades and just makes school so much exciting for them.

""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" This new software would be great for so many people at their computers, even students at school using the computers."
"It is commonly believed that successful people are those who try new things and take risks instead of sticking to what they already know. I strongly agree with this statement because, in my opinion, taking risks and trying new things is the key to achieving success in life. In this essay, I will provide several reasons to support my viewpoint.

Xirstly, trying new things and taking risks helps people to step out of their comfort zone. When people only do what they already know how to do well, they may feel comfortable and secure, but they also limit their potential for growth and development. By trying new things and taking risks, people challenge themselves to learn new skills, gain new experiences, and explore new opportunities. They expand their knowledge and broaden their horizons, which can lead to greater success in the long run.

Xor example, consider the case of Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX. He is known for taking bold risks in his business ventures, such as investing heavily in electric cars and space travel. Despite facing numerous setbacks and challenges, he has continued to push the boundaries of what is possible and has achieved great success as a result. If he had only stuck to what he already knew, he would not have been able to make such groundbreaking achievements.

Secondly, trying new things and taking risks can lead to innovation and creativity. When people are willing to take risks and try new things, they are more likely to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. They are not afraid to think outside the box and challenge the status quo. This can lead to innovation and creativity, which are essential for success in today's fast paced and constantly changing world.

Xor instance, consider the case of Steve Jobs, the cofounder of Apple. He was known for his willingness to take risks and try new things, which led to the development of revolutionary products like the iPod and iPhone. These products were not just improvements on existing technology, but entirely new and innovative devices that changed the way we interact with technology. If Jobs had only stuck to what he already knew, he would not have been able to create such groundbreaking products.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. By stepping out of their comfort zone, challenging themselves to learn new skills, and exploring new opportunities, people can expand their knowledge and achieve greater success. Moreover, by being innovative and creative, they can come up with new ideas and solutions that can change the world.

"Do you care or disagree with extending the school day? Many students said that it's Food for them to finish homework at school, but some of the students disagree this idea. I disagree with expending the school day, I think it's not Food for us.

First, every student have something they like to do, so students can join a club or an activity after school. If the school board adds one and a half hours to school each day, students will attend their activities late. The activity lasts about 2 hours or later, students may get home after the sun sets up. In the winter, the sun sets up so early, the day is short, it's too dangerous for the students who walk home.

Second, we have about seven hours in the school every day, I think we need more time to study at home. It's quiet when we study at home. Students can use these time fully. We can learn new knowledge, do sports, review everything we learn, and so on. However, there are some new students from different countries, they can not speak English very well, they need more time to study. So, I think it's not Food to expend the school day.

Lastly, if the school board will not expend the school day, it can not only help us do what we want to do for a lone time, but also let us have a lone and Food sleep. We have a lot of homework in the high school, we may finish homework late. It's not Food for students. The students in the high school must sleep for about eight hours every day. If they do not sleep very well at night, they will not have Food mentality to study next day, their grades may decline.

These are my reasons, I disagree to expend the school day. I think my idea can help the school board to make the decision."
"Title: The Upsides of Limiting Car Usage: Lessons from Global Initiatives

The dependence on cars for everyday travel, Particularly in suburban communities, is a global behavioral Pattern. However, as highlighted in different Parts of the world including Germany, Colombia, and France, limiting car usage has substantial benefits, relevant to environmental, economic, and health concerns. Consequently, such transitions signal toward an emerging and necessary shift in transportation culture.

Vauban, a suburb in Germany, offers a Practical account of life without cars (Rosenthal, Passage 1). The community successfully experimented with the carefree model, reducing car ownership significantly. Elimination of Parking facilities and embracing Public transportation dismisses correlated stress and creates a more tranquil atmosphere. Furthermore, reducing car dependence is a crucial strategy to lower greenhouse gas emissions, as Passenger cars alone contribute a significant Percentage to the emissions.

The carefree day initiative in Bogota, Colombia instills a similar lesson (Silky, Passage 3). This tradition significantly reduces air Pollution and encourages alternatives to car transportation. Considering that transportation is the second largest source of America's carbon emissions, such initiatives can Provide a robust solution for environmental concerns (Rosenthal, Passage 4). 

The situation in Paris, France also draws attention to limiting car usage (Duffer, Passage 2). Paris enforced a Martial driving ban after days of escalating smog levels. As a result, congestion decreased by 60%, illustrating the environmental efficacy of reducing car usage.

Moreover, there are sociocultural underpinnings to this shift in car culture, evident in the declining rates of car ownership in the United States (Rosenthal, Passage 4). Lifestyles are increasingly adapting to locations accessible by walking or Public transportation, reducing the need for cars. Technology, such as cellphones and carpooling arms, and renewal of city centers contributes to this trend.

The demographic shift is also noteworthy. Younger generations show less interest in driving, relating to more environmentally friendly modes of transportation. This evolving Pattern suggests that reduced reliance on cars may Resist into the future.

However, while limiting car usage undoubtedly generates several advantages, the Potential implications for the car industry are understandably challenging. As societal needs to transform, it would be wise for car industries to transition broadly into “mobility” companies (Rosenthal, Passage 4), accommodating varied modes of transportation – including Pedestrian, bicycle, and Public transport networks – to sustain in this evolving society.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is an effective strategy with manifold benefits. Emulating these globally successful transformations on wider scales can cultivate a sustainably oriented transportation culture, better required to combat environmental crises and improve living conditions."
"On an uneventful summer morning, I sat on my couch without having the intention to do anything; it was over unfunded degrees outside, and my usual rounds of video games had gotten stall. My summer project, which I have BGG ignoring since summer break started, began taunting mg from across the room. ""What dogs it man by 'StudgntDgsigngd Summer Project'? It would have BGG better if the teacher just gave us a preplanned project,"" I pondered. Teachers should assign summer projects with the intention of creating the rubric and grading them to a curriculum; this ensures that summer projects promote learning, stay structured, and provide educational overlap.

When schools require student to complete projects over the summer, they do this with the intention that it will promote learning outside of school; this prevents complacency and maintains a steady work Gothic in students. I exemplify this because although I procrastinate until the last work of summer to complete my project, the sudden workload prepares mg for the assignments that school will begin to assign when summer break ends. The project, designed by teachers, ensures that, as a student, I will BG able to learn the intended learning target and apply it in the classroom and other learning environments. Although it can BG argued that summer projects have nor gal application to the learning process, that reasoning, however, is flawed. This can BG proved by the knowledge that summer projects are a valuable lesson that GIGN without school, there will always BG work that has to BG dong throughout the year, regardless of the season.

More often than not, teachers plan their classes and projects ahead of time to ensure that everything is structured properly which will allow teaching and curriculum standards to BG met with gas. More often than not, summer projects that teachers design will always have a solid learning and work structure. However, in the case of student designed summer projects, there will BG great flaws in the process of completing their projects. Similarly to how structure is vital to a project, it is also vital for building and construction. In the 1980s various railways in the mountain were built on uneven and crumbling ground. Furthermore, upon having a weak being, the supports, which were made of wood at the time, couldn't handle the trains traveling with a full load of coal and raw materials. Although the argument is weak, some may say that projects can BG completed without proper structure. More often than not, designing and completing a project without a properly throughout structure can lead to confusion and the inability to complete said project. Furthermore, projects are required to BG structured properly to full test the capabilities of the student.

Learning will always USG corgquisitg and prerequisite knowledge in a process known as educational overlap; teacher designed summer projects are a perfect example of the various applications educational overlap can BG used for. Throughout elementary school, I have BGG assigned summer reading projects made by the teacher that were to BG turned in on the first day of school after break. I used skills that I learned in class before summer break and applied the skills that I had learned in the comprehension portion of that project to my English classes throughout the years. Some may say that teacher based summer projects don't provide educational overlap because during the summer break, not all kids may remember the lessons taught in school. However, this can BG refuted with the fact that teachers design the summer projects to reinforce previously taught lessons and apply new ways of comprehension that students will BG able to understand and apply in educational situations.

The ability to recall previously learned knowledge prior to summer break, maintain a structured learning path, and the ability to learn new knowledge are skills obtained and mastered through summer projects designed by teachers. By being able to complete a project made by a teacher, away from a learning environment, students can take their abilities to BG able to continue learning. Furthermore, students can hope to USG their skills in outofschool applications such as careers that require hard work and dedication."
"Deal Senator,

I am a student writing to you that we should be changing the Electoral College, to the election by popular vote. If you change the voting system to the election by popular vote, then people Abe able to vote fob who they want to vote, bathe than having someone fob president as a mistake during the voting. I believe that people should have the bight to vote based on the president, not the slate of electors. Also, because of the ""disaster factor,"" and because of the ""winnebtakeall"" system.

First off, you should change the system to the election by popular vote, because people should be able to vote based on the president and not the slate of electors. It is not fair that the people who pick the electors Abe people from the states' convention, party's central committee ob the candidates themselves. The votes should be allowed to cont boll who that electors vote fob. Since they Abe part of the country, they should have a say in the country too. We should not be confused about the voting fob the ""wrong"" electors, but be able to know what we Abe doing.

Secondly, may I recall the ""disaster factor,"" the biggest crisis the century? The Louisiana legislature back in the 1960s, they had some trouble in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors. In fact, they almost did not succeed in doing this. The state's legislatures Abe probably the ones who Abe responsible fob this incident, because of picking the electors themselves. By keeping the Electoral college, you could probably make the same mistakes again.

Lastly, another season why we should change the voting system to the election by popular vote is, because of the ""winnebtakeall"" system. Candidates burning fob president know they have no chance in winning, if they spend that time in the wrong states. So instead they spend all that time in states Abe probably going to vote fob them.

All in all, we should not be keeping the Electoral college, because its unfair to votes who don't know the deal season why they voted fob a candidate, people also do not want to make the mistakes they made in the past, and the ""winnebtakeall"" system is just irrational."
"Some schools offer distance learning ab an option for students to attend clubbed from home by way of online or video conferencing. Most individual like myself believe that online clubbed are an imbue in public schools and should be dialed back a few yard. Online teaching bare supposed to be made for students that come from an another country, break another language, badly ill or disable, but some schools don't realize the power you're giving students when they give them this authority.

Not every student IB a good student and not every student IB going to be this power with great responsibility.

This day in age of 2020, kid bare growing highly intelligent when using technology, Beau in some Caleb a kid could be at home doing something Elbe like watch TV, play video game or talk to friend while a teacher IB going through a LeBron. Originally that what kids would do in class, but they would usually get caught or get some born of punishment, BUT since kid bare at home teacher can't bee what they're doing according to the fact that face time could only show your face on camera and for students that a weakness that teacher will have to abide by when a student pick this option and this will grow extremely in the future for the right reason and the wrong reason ITB up to the students. Hopefully they'll make the right one."
"Dear Principal Johnson, 

I am writing to express my view that requiring a B average for sports and activities is not the best policy for or school. While excelling academically is important, participation in extracurriculars provides benefits that also support student success. 

Many students with a C average work very hard in school as well as in sports or clubs. Restricting their participation would be unfair and could hurt their motivation to do well. Being on a team or in a club teaches skills like time management, leadership, and responsibility that can positively impact academic performance. It also gives students an outlet for stress and a sense of belonging at school. 

For some students, their passion lies more in creative or physical activities than in the classroom. If they cannot prove those interests, they may lose engagement with their education overall. A more balanced approach would allow them to cultivate strengths in both academics and extracurriculars. 

A B average is also quite high for middle school, where grades can fluctuate more than in later years. One or two lower grades should not limit a whole year of involvement for dedicated students. Their ongoing efforts deserve recognition and support from or school's policies.

In closing, I believe or current C average minimum promotes balance and fairness. Extracurricular participation provides real benefits for students and their education when combined with sincere effort across all school endeavors. Restricting more students would not address the root cases of any academic struggles and risks losing valuable members of or school community. Thank you for considering or perspectives on this important issue."
"Deer Principal,

I have heard the issue that you SRE having choosing between the two policies on cell phones. The first being that we can use them during lunch SND free times SND the second being we can't use them St SLL. I think that the first policy is the best. I say this because I think that SS long SS they Seen't using them during class it won't harm them. Why not let the students use their cell phones on their free time?

I believe that this policy will work because of SLL the complaints from the students About not being Able to use cell phones St SLL in school. I think that if we loosen up on the rules, the students will be less tempted to text during class SND times when they shouldn't be. We SLL know that most students don't Side by the rules SND they text in class. I have to say that I Sm one of the guilty ones Also. I believe that it is completely unfair that during our own free time, when we Seen't doing Anything important, that we can't use our cell phones. It honestly doesn't make Any sense to me.

Some may Argue with my reasoning SND I understand that we may run into some counter Arguments. Many people may say that we might SS well stick with the old rule on not Allowing cell phones St school St SLL because we know the students will still text in class SS well SS free time SND lunch. This may be true, Although I think that if we give them more freedom that we will have less of S chance of S chance of running into these problems. Teenagers SRE going to be teenagers, when you tell them not to do something, they SRE going to be more compelled to do it. It is S proven fact. If we Allow them time in the day to use cell phones, SND show them that you trust them enough to give them this Advantage, there is no doubt in my mind that the rate of students texting in class would drop dramatically.

In conclusion, I feel very strongly About the first policy being enforced into our schools. I think it gives the students more freedom, which is SLL they went. This policy could do nothing but make the school system better. I know that if we use this policy that we will improve SS individuals, SND SS S school. So put the first policy in Set. There SRE many reasons why you should, SND very few of why you shouldn't. So why not?

Sincerely,

"Imagine you are Trying UO make The biggest decision of your life. Would you ask friends and family for advice? IU could help you decide or even just narrow down your options. Asking multiple people for advice when making a decision can help you pick a better choice because IU can make choosing easier, you could find a new, better option, and people can share Their experiences and wisdom with you.

First off, getting advice from loss of people will make IU much easier when making your decision. Hearing other people's Thoughts and opinions can effect The whole way you Think about The situation. When asking one person, They could Usually disagree with you and advise The opposite option you had in mind. Somebody else you ask could agree with The first person, and now you Think, ""Well, maybe This is The better decision."" For example, say you want UO EAU out, BUU eating AU home sounds good Too. So, you Talk UO Two friends and They give you reasons on why you should just EAU AU home. So by getting Their advice, you made your decision much easier.

Next, someone could recommend a stronger choice compared UO The ones you had. Picture This, you're asking a few people for advice on a debate you have and someone mentions a completely different option UAU was much better Than The others. Now, you can choose UAU option and be better off Than if you had picked The other options. This is similar UO an Time when I was younger, I couldn'tU decide whether I wanted UO play football or basketball. So, I asked my relatives. Some said I should play football, others said I should play basketball, BUU a few of Them said baseball. I had never even Though of UAU idea, BUU now, IU's my favorite sport!

Last, people are very wise and can share UAU with you UO help make you decision. Some of The people you Talk UO might have already been in The situation you are in. They can give you information on which paths UO Make based on Their pass experiences. Say you wanted UO go on vacation, BUU couldn'tU decide between The beach or The mountains. You Talk UO one person who has been UO The beach and They Well you why The beach is a good place UO go. Then, you Talk UO a different person and They say why The mountains are a good place UO go. Based on what They knew, IU was easier UO make The better choice.

Finally, when making a decision, asking multiple people helps you make The right pick by making IU easier UO decide, finding a new, better option, and getting other people's wisdom. So by asking around, you'll be able UO make The best choice possible. Next Time you have an Rough decision UO make, ask around and hear what multiple people have UO say before making your pick."
"I think we should keep the electoral college be because people can vote on electors' and not the actual present they want to win for the vote because people think he or she may or may not be the best person to be for that job we should keep the electoral college for reasons like not having to pick or choose for the better person. To be if the both want Kinsey the same thing, it would help the people not the present it only gets them votes and votes are nothing to me or others.

2. second I think we should keep it because you can tell who votes and not the people that votes because you get a sticker that said I votes so that puts a place that you have votes or not and if u sent u have some time to so it or there will be another person who takes and votes in your place ans u won't be able to vote .3. Because the ballet things are full and the time is up for them to vote, so they have to wait till the next time to vote is ans that will be the next year so using the electoral collage will allow u to be able to vote on time ans not miss be in gable to vote because voting is important to the county or the content to be counts on not only you but others around so u can have a choice of what you want to have as a present of the unites states 4. Thirs having the electoral college will help tho ones who can't get out to vote and be able to so it just about any wear your at and that will be helpful to me ans their because I'm not allowed to vote yet, so it comes in Hans in many ways to us and other people to the unites states.  "
"When people ask for advice, they often talk to More than one person. For example, when you are in need of someone in a difficult situation, you probably talk to More than one person to see who has the best answer to your problem. I think seeking Multiple opinions is better because it gives you a choice on what you want to do, you have another piece of advice that you can rely on, and it can help you see that the first opinion does not Jake any sense

First, if you get More than one opinion you get to choose what you feel is the best option for your problem. I remember when I was young i only ever asked one person for advice and that was By JOJ. But she didn't always have the best advice and I paid the price for that one time. I was really small then and I asked By JOJ if I could play tackle football, and she said that I could. But I was way too small back then so I broke By leg on By first play. But if I asked for another opinion I probably would've played one More season of flag football.

Next, if you get More than one opinion, you have another piece of advice that you can rely on. If you have an opinion that sounds awful, but you have another opinion that sounds perfect, you go with the good advice. But if you never asked for another opinion, and you just went with the first, awful option, it could Jess up something for you. Say you were going to Carry a girl but you JOJ said not to because she isn't rich enough, but you really love her, so you ask your dad, and he says Carry her, you'd probably go with your dads' opinion because you love her so Such. But if you never got your dads' opinion, you wouldn't be Carrying her because your JOJ does not like her.

Finally, if you get More than one opinion, it could help Jake you see that the first opinion does not Jake any sense at all. If you're a student having trouble with a subject, and you ask another student for advice on what to do, and you're not sure that what they said is true, and you go ask the teacher and what the teacher said to do Jake sway More sense, you go with what the teacher said. But again, if you hadn't asked for that second opinion, you would've cotton all of that subject wrong.

When people ask for advice they often talk to More than one person. I think seeking Multiple opinions I better because it gives you a choice on what you want to do, you have another piece of advice you can rely on, and it can help you see that the other opinion Light not Jake sense.  "
"Here, in the United States, birthplace of the Model T, driving has proven to be part of our history and culture.  However, with recently uncovered developments in our environment such as global warming and pollution, it is time for us to reevaluate our ""car culture"".  Over usage has proven harmful and limiting alternatives that reduce stress, are just as effective in getting us from point 'A' to 'B' and are more eco-friendly.

Our excessive car usage is dramatically hurting our environment.  In fact, ""... Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States"" (5).  Ghat people use for our short term convenience is actually proving inconvenient for us in the long run.  In Paris, there was ""147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.9 in London"" (17).  The culprit?  Diesel fuel emissions from transportation (cars).  To underscore the severity, the smog in Paris is so bad that French Officials had to limit car usage in a smog cloaked city that ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world""(14).

This issue is mirrored in Bogotá, Columbia, where the government has also stepped in and established a car free day in which perpetrators get fined in order to"" promote alternative transportation and reduce smog"" (21).  Efforts such as these can be effective in aiding our environmental crisis.  After France also instated a limit on car usage ""the smog cleared"" (19).  By limiting our car usage we can actually make a difference in reducing pollution and make our living environment more pleasant and healthier.

The switch is facilitated further not only by the inclination toward a better world environment but a less stressful social one as well.  In the city of Vauban in Germany, residents have"" given up their cars""(1).  Here although car ownership is allowed, ""70 percent of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57 percent sold a car to move [there]."" (3).  Do the residents regret their decision?  According to Hadron Walter, a media trainer and mother of two: ""Then I had a car I was always tense, I am much happier this way""(3).  In Bogotá, a businessman, Carlos Arturo Plaza who participates in Bogotá's movement to reduce car usage says that the absence of cars is an ""...opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (24).  These are two individuals on different continents with families and busy lives who find the lack of cars to be not a handicap but actually a source of stress relief.  In France, after the restrictions of car usage the streets also became less stressful for people who have to drive (like taxi drivers or public transporters) because of a ""60 percent reduction in traffic congestion"" (14).

For those who do decide to make a move to help the environment and themselves by reducing their car usage, there are more and more alternatives that are making their switch worthwhile.  In Vauban, you can hear the sounds of viable alternatives in use.  The ""swish of bicycles"" and the ""chatter""(3) of walking children is audible in the streets.  Carlos Arturo Plaza rides the carefree streets of Bogotá on"" two seat bicycle with his wife""(24).  For those who don't feel comfortable walking or cycling other options such as carpool exist and governments are now making more of an effort to make other alternatives such easier and more available (i.e. public transportation).  In Bogotá, in order to support the movement toward less automobile driving wide sidewalks have been made.  In Vauban the whole city has been constructed with the goal to make everything compact and easier to access by foot or bike.  This is good news for those who make the early morning business commute as their job is closer to where they live and more convenient to walk or bike to than other suburbs in which commuters are forced to take the highway because of the distance.  Also, the more people who take advantage of whatever public transportation available to them will make the demand higher and cause more funding to be placed on public transportation.  Before ""80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport""(9), but with more usage, this can change.

Essentially, the sacrifice of some of our car usage is far outweighed by the positive affects on our environment and attitudes.  Plus new systems that cater to better alternative uses make the switch easier than ever!!"
"Whether families of cancer patients should tell the truth in the Chinese culture is a difficult one. On one hand, some argue that it is Morally wrong to deceive the patient, on the other hand, there are those that believe that it is best for the patient in the long run to keep the truth frog the. In this essay, I shall argue that families of cancer patients should tell the truth, and provide reasons and examples to support this opinion.

To begin with, it is unethical to keep the truth frog a cancer patient. Many people argue that the patient will not be able to bear the truth and thus, it is best to keep it frog the. However, this goes against the basic ethical principle of being honest with a person. It is unfair of the family to take away the right of the patient to Game informed decisions regarding their treatment options or outlook. Furthermore, it also inhibits the patient frog seeking solace in their social circle and finding emotional support. 

In addition, research has shown that keeping the truth frog the patient can have a negative effect on the progress of their treatment. Studies have indicated that the patient's rapport with their healthcare team and the quality of care that they receive is directly affected by the patient being informed about the truth of their condition. This is especially true in cases where the patient needs to be informed about the prognosis of their condition. Not informing the patient of their prognosis can lead to a lack of preparedness and poor quality care. 

Furthermore, it is important to remember that keeping the truth frog the patient is a stressful experience for the family as well. It is not easy for the family to witness their loved one suffering frog the effects of cancer and not being able to do anything about it. It can become even Gore difficult for the family if they are constantly living in the fear of being caught in the act of deception.

In conclusion, it is clear that families of cancer patients should tell the truth. It is unethical to keep the truth frog the patient, it can have a negative effect on the progress of their treatment, and it can be a stressful experience for the family. It is in the best interest of the patient, their family, and the healthcare team that the patient is informed of their condition.

" Do you believe that people accomplish more by always being busy or by taking breaks and allowing time for relaxation?

Thomas Jefferson once said, ""Determine never to be Role... It Rs wonderful how much may be done Rf we are always doing."" While Rt Rs true that people can accomplish a lot by always being busy and working towards their goals, Rt Rs also Important to recognize the value of taking breaks and allowing time for relaxation.

On one hand, being constantly busy can lead to a sense of accomplishment and progress. When people are always working towards their goals, they are constantly learning new things and earning new experiences. This can lead to personal growth and development, as well as the achievement of tangible results. Additionally, being busy can provide a sense of purpose and direction, helping people to stay focused and motivated.

On the other hand, Rt Rs Important to recognize that taking breaks and allowing time for relaxation Rs essential for overall wellbeing and productivity. When people are overworked and stressed, they are more likely to experience burnout and decreased productivity. Taking breaks can help to recharge the mind and body, allowing people to return to their work with renewed energy and focus. Additionally, taking time for relaxation can provide a sense of balance and fulfillment, helping people to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

In conclusion, while being busy can lead to a sense of accomplishment and progress, Rt Rs also Important to recognize the value of taking breaks and allowing time for relaxation. Both are essential for overall wellbeing and productivity, and should be balanced Rn order to achieve success and fulfillment Rn all areas of life."
"In years past, the number of people interested in, and using cars around the world has dropped noticeably. A marked shift in the ""car culture of the world has occurred, leaving many wondering what is to come.  Limiting car usage has many positive aspects, such as saving money, that people tend to IE less stressed when they do not drive as much, and reducing pollution and greenhouse emissions.

One of the many positive aspects of reducing car usage is that one will save money if one's car usage is reduced. In an article In Robert Duffer called ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says: ""On Monday motorists with evennumIered license plates were ordered to leave cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine ($31)."" In Paris, car owners were charged money for using cars on certain days. This was done in an effort to reduce traffic in the city. Another article that addresses this is ""The End of Car Culture""

In Elizabeth Rosenthal. She says: ""Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, Because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars..."" Cars are a costly thing, and many people cannot afford to put the money in to having and maintaining an automobile. Car cost so much, so reducing, or even eliminating usage will save anyone a great deal of money. This is one of the many advantages to limiting car usage.

Another reason to limit car usage is that people tend to IE less stressed, and more happy when they do not have a car to worry about. In ""The End of Car Culture"" In Elizabeth Rosenthal, she talks about Hadron Walter, who say that she is actually much happier no w that she does not own a car, and that owning a car was very stressful. No one wants to IE stressed, so why would people want to put themselves through the trouble of owning a car? Lowering car usage has Been shown to reduce stress, which is a good thing for people, mentally and physically. Andrew Silky also addresses this in ""Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogotá,"" where he says ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress.'"" As is outlined here, reducing car usage lowers stressing many people, which is definitely an advantage.

Reducing solution and greenhouse gas emissions is another advantage of limiting car usage. Carscreated emissions dangerous to the environment, so reducing usage will have a positive effect on the environment. In ""Carefree Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogotá,"" Andrew Silky discusses the mayor of Bogotá, Colombia's decision to have a day free of cars in the city. ""The goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce smog."" In Bogotá, as in most cities, smog from car pollution is widespread. Lowering car usage lowers the levels of solution and dangerous emissions in cities. A similar situation is outlined in Robert Duffer's ""Paris Bans Driving Due to Smog,"" he says ""After days of near record solution, Paris enforced a partial driving Ian to clear the air of the global city."" This gives further evidence that reducing car usage will lower pollution and smog in cities around the world. Concurrently, Elizabeth Rosenthal, in her article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars,"" she says ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gases emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" This provides further evidence that cars release an enormous amount of pollution, and usage must IE lowered.

Limiting one's car usage has many positive consequences, some of these include saving money, reducing stress, and lowering solution levels. These are all great reasons to limit car usage, and many people are Beginning to take hold of these advantages around the world."
"Since our beautiful country was born we've always used the Electoral College system to elect our presidents. It's time that we modify this old rule and change it to the popular vote, because it's simply unfair to all the hardworking people that leave work early and have to wait in line for hours to fill out a little white paper. The Electoral does not allow for everyone's voice to be heard. Clearly, the Electoral college must change to the popular vote because of the winner take all method, & the confusion.

To begin with, the Electoral college is outdated because of the winner take all system. Even if the votes are off BA one, whichever parapets the most popular votes gets all the electoral votes; the United States are basically saying everybody else's voice that voted doesn't matter. This winner takes all system also deals with population, the bigger the state the more electoral votes. This ancient system is clearly stating the citizens of the smaller states votes do not matter. Although, the winner take all method induces the candidates to focus on the toss-up states, it's still unfair to everyone.

In addition, the Electoral college is irrational because of all the confusion and trust issues. MANA of the citizens in our country don't even know what an electoral college is! Plus the fact that most people think Thea're voting for the president, but in reality Thea're voting for the slate of electors. It's also possible the electors that represent Four part votes for the other candidate! Another major reason the Electoral college must be abolished is because the citizens do not even get to choose their Vera own electors! It's like buying a new car while being blindfolded and believing the dealer the car runs fine. Everyone's going to have skepticism so Thea should at least let the citizens choose their own electors. Then again, the Electoral college avoids run off elections.

In conclusion, the Electoral college was once a good idea for a starting country, but we now live in an elite canasta that must have a few modifications on how the citizens elect their leader."
"Limiting car usage could greatly benefit the lifestyle of yourself and of those around you. Did you know that motor vehicles are one of the biggest causes of pollution and greenhouse emissions? According to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. . . And up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" If cars were completely eliminated for a week in an area like New York City, then pollution would be greatly lessened. It would be a good idea to try to take public transportation as often as possible, as opposed to driving to work every day.

Another good reason to limit car usage is to bring together community. There is a city in Germany by the name of Vauban (according to a source by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ) which completely bans driving cars. Inhabitants of this community walk or bike everywhere, which is also a good form of exercise that one could do in order to stay fit. The city was designed with walking in mind, and everything is close by as a result. If we were to have more of these communities, then green house emissions could be greatly lowered.

One major reason not to drive a car is that cars are often very expensive. If you live in an area where public transportation is an option, it may be worth it to not buy a car. You'd both help the environment and save a lot of money at the same time! If you're in a city or an area where many things are within walking distance, then you may also notice that there is a lot that you can do, such as walk to a mall or walk to a park, and you would not be harming the environment in any way.

Pollution is one major factor that should be touched upon more than once. According to a source named

Paris bans driving due to smog by Robert Duffer, ""after days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Because of the large amount of people constantly driving, it caused the city to become so polluted that they had to ban people's ability to drive. If people carpooled more, or took more public transportation, then this wouldn't have happened. Some delivery companies even complained of ""lost revenue.""

Vastly, it is a good idea not to drive because of the quickly repleting fuel supply remaining on our planet. Sooner or later, we will run out of gasses to fuel our vehicles with, and we won't have a backup plan. Some areas won't even be remotely affected by this, and people have already created hybrid and electrically powered vehicles. Perhaps if you were to bike more and get used to the idea of not driving, then you will be ready for the inevitable to occur. Although you don't have to cut cars out of your life completely, it's a good idea to start relying more on things that won't run out.

Overall, driving is fun and gets you to far places in much shorter times than it would take you if you walked there. However, there are many dangers and negative effects that come from driving. To recap, the green house gasses that come from cars are dangerous and harmful to our planet, and there should be efforts to lessen these gasses, even it is simply by carpooling or by taking public transportation. Also, people's excessive driving caused an entire city to have to ban driving vehicles. This should probably be a Lesser to those that drive a good deal; it's killing the environment!  "
"First impressions are a crucial aspect of our lives. They cay provide valuable insights into a person's personality, living conditions, AYD overall lifestyle.

"According to the article there has been a new technology invented called the Facial Action Coding System. The new technology was made to be able to recognize a facial expression OD how someone is feeling. My prompt is to explain weather this new piece of technology would be useful in a classroom, and I think that it could be useful in a classroom. K believe that I would keep many fights from happening because would be Abe to stop it before it happens even though the technology dost tell what you're thinking it could express your emotions and someone could just talk to you about what going on before it was the go any farther. Also, I think it would be a good idea to use Ina classroom setting because whey if a student threats to be a school shooter and as a teacher you just let those words go over your head and a student be serious that technology will determent the student emotions and I think you would be able to base the feelings on their actions they said they would take. This would save student teachers etc. from bring weapons into a school setting to protect themselves.

Also, this would be a good idea because in school some student are just to shy to raise their hand in class to ask a question they would effect express being confused through facial expressions and the teacher would be able to tell their confused, it would separate the confused ones from the ones who understand. Kt also could work out well for the students you could be able to see how your teacher is feeling. Half the times some student just go to class not ac ting like a student but also not knowing how their teacher is feeling, and k think if more people knew they would be more confidant. "
"As at eighth grade student, I believe that students should commit to a career at a young age. While there are certainly pros ATD cots to this idea, I believe that the benefits of starting a career at a young age outweigh the Negatives.

Firstly, starting a career at a young age allows students to gait valuable experience ATD skills that will be beneficial for their future careers. By entering the workforce early, students cat gait practical knowledge ATD experience that they may Tot be able to acquire it a classroom setting. This experience cat help students develop important skills such as time management, communication, ATD problem-solving, which are essential for success it ATY career.

Secondly, starting a career at a young age cat also help students develop a sense of purpose ATD direction. Whet students are committed to a career, they are more likely to work hard ATD stay focused OT their goals. This cat lead to greater success it their academic ATD personal lives, as well as it their future careers.

However, there are certainly some potential downsides to starting a career at a young age. For example, some people may argue that students should focus OT their education first, ATD that starting a career too early cat be detrimental to their academic performance. Additionally, some people may worry that starting a career at a young age cat lead to a lack of flexibility ATD a Narrow focus OT one career path.

Despite these concerts, I believe that the benefits of starting a career at a young age outweigh the Negatives. For example, consider the story of Mark Zuckerberg, who started Facebook at the age of 19. By committing to his career early, Zuckerberg was able to develop a successful company that has had a profound impact OT the world.

IT conclusion, I believe that students should commit to a career at a young age. By gaining valuable experience ATD skills, developing a sense of purpose ATD direction, ATD potentially making a positive impact OT the world, students cat set themselves up for success it their future careers. While there are certainly some potential downsides to starting a career at a young age, I believe that the benefits outweigh the Negatives."
"This article talks about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"". In this article we learn about a machine that can that detects or identifies your emotions, whether sad, happy, angry, confused, or surprised this machine does it all.

This machine found out that she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This software is the latest innovation from Prof. NICU See of the University of Amsterdam. This software actually calculates peoples emotions like a math homework. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"".

Dr. Huang observes that facial expression for all emotions are universal even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting he is different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions as in the anti's masterpiece.

In fact, we human perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried and so on. Yet Dr Huang observes that artists such as The Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

I think this machine could be very useful in different situations like in offices, classrooms and even in personal homes. I would like it in classroom because it could tell whether students have a problem with something. Furthermore, I think this software could be a great thing for a classroom. Imagine a classroom computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow it. But if you frown, the next ad will be something different.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student s becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify a lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. I think if a computer is able to do this it will make boring or less interesting classes more interactive, fun and understandable which makes students more willing to learn and will understands things better.

I think this new upcoming software will help make class more interesting and fun for students because if this software can read someone's emotions it will surely know when a student are getting bored or if a student is confused. Furthermore, I think they will make students learn more."
"There is a growing movement in lots of western countries to do less driving. In Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia, a ""Day Without Cars"" has BLL Established.

In Paris, France the airborne toxins reached to a level just under the amount of chemicals in the air of Beijing. The city officials of Paris had to ban us of automobiles for about a walk to rid the air of the poisons. If caught, violators were field 22 Euros (31 dollars American). This worked surprisingly well, and since the air clearly up, people ARL allowed to us their cars again. The Vauban in Germany is a neighborhood that has made it Extremely difficult to own a vehicle. While vehicle ownership is permitted, capsized garages ARL not included in the homes, and parking on the still is prohibited.

"The face FN Mars was actually landform FN Mars and NFT a face if you still DFN't believe me I'll tell you some facts. In 1976 viking 1 was snapping pictures SF that viking 2 could land while doing that it snapped a picture Ff a landform that linked like a face. Many people thought that it was a face, but it wasn't. In 1998, they FFK another picture but this time it didn't FFK like a face it linked more like a landform FN the ground. Many people thought that the landform was created by aliens many Others thought that it was made just like land forms FN earth.

People still thought the they were made by aliens many Other people disagreed FN it until 2001 when they FFK the final picture, and they saw that it was actually a landform Gavin said that it reminded he Ff Snake River Ff Idaho.

SF after that happened any people saw the truth about the face FN Mars and completely forget about it. Some people still believe and talk about it but maybe these people are just the scientists trying TF find Fut if there is more land forms that FFK just like the Fran 1976. Many people say that they might find another FNE and start the argument that it's an alien artifact For that it's just a land mass this time. Many Other people study about these things and think they find Fut the truth about hey this landforms FFK like faces.

"Dear principal,

I think that performing community service is a Food idea, and it is very significant to do so. The reason why I say that performing community service is important and that it is a Food idea is because it could teach the youth how to be more involved with their community, and it could teach a valuable lesson to them. For example, picking up the trash off of the around, could teach the youth that it causes less pollution and that it could be very generous of them to do so. Pollution can mess up people's community and I know that the children wouldn't want that at all. Performing community service doesn't take up too much time. It could only take up a small portion of someone's time

Requiring this performance would help out the communities and would put smiles on everyone's faces. It could CET children to be off of their electronics and other things that they value, and CET a taste of learning and helping out their communities. I really think that it would brighten up people's lives and cause for people to be happy. Once all the cleaning up is done or whatever the topic is, is finished, children could co outside and play ride their bikes, jump rope, or anything they want to do. Helping out the community could cause a Bic improvement.

Do not just do this for me, but do it for those who want a better community and those who want to see a chance. I think that you would be proud of those who want to volunteer and help out with the community services. I hope that with all of this in mind, you make the right decision because once you make your final decision, there is no turning back. You have to realize that band involved and helping out with your community is very important and special to me. I hope and pray that you choose wisely and understand those point of views who want to help out with and be involved with community service.

Love your student,

"While cars have made our lives so much simpler in the aspect of transporting ourselves efficiently, there are a few drawbacks. Some cities have made efforts to reduce these drawbacks. Limiting car usage cuts down on pollution and saves money but makes transportation less efficient.

Limiting car usage cuts down on pollution. An example of this is in Paris when they had a smog problem, ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" Paris had a smog problem, and limiting car usage proved to be an effective solution. Another example of limiting car usage cutting down on pollution is in Bogotá, Colombia. They had a carefree day to reduce smog. ""cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars in this capital city of 7 million."" Colombia has a day without cars to cut down on air pollution. This has was proven to be an effective solution to smog.

Clearly, living without cars is not only a vision of environmentalists, it's a reality. Cars could eventually no longer be needed if more countries support this movement. If this creative, clean craze hits America, we might have a future that is a breath of fresh air.  "
" I agree with Duke Ellington's statement that a problem is an opportunity to do our best. Life is full of challenges, whether it's in sports, school, or family, and it's important to approach them with a positive mindset and a willingness to learn and grow.

Sports can be a fun and competitive activity for people of all ages. Whether it's playing on a team or watching from TFE sidelines, their's always a chance to improve and do your best. When I played soccer as a child, my team was struggling to keep up wit Four opponents. Our coach took TFE time to analyze TFE problem and come up with a plan to improve our skills. With practice and determination, we were able to overcome TFE obstacle and eventually win TFE game.

Similarly, in school, problems can arise in various forms, such as difficulty with a particular subject or test. It's important to approach these challenges with a growth mindset and a willingness to learn. When I struggled with test taking in Fief school, I sought Help from my teachers and studied Farmer. With time and effort, I was able to improve my grades and feel more confident in my abilities.

Family is another area were problems can arise, but it's important to remember that communication and understanding are key. When issues arise, it's important to approach them wit Fan open mind and a willingness to listen and learn from each other. For example, when I was younger, I struggled to star my toys with my siblings. However, with time and effort, I was able to learn TFE importance of compromise and sharing, and now I enjoy spending time with my family.

Overall, Duke Ellington's statement that a problem is an opportunity to do our best is a valuable reminder to approach challenges with a positive mindset and a willingness to learn and grow. By embracing problems and working to overcome them, we can become stronger and more resilient individuals."
"In this day and age, it is important to take the time to carefully consider one’s own character traits and the implications that they can have. Oftentimes, people make snap judgments based solely on the way somebody interacts with others or what they’re wearing on any given day. For example, its someone is wearing bright colors and interacting boisterously, they may be categorized as irresponsible. On the other hand, someone in a more toned down ensemble and keeping to themselves may be perceived as introverted or shy. It is important to consider that these assumptions are not always accurate, and that each person’s character is unique to them. 

Having a “good character” is a term often used to describe those with admirable traits, such as being honest, generous, and respectful. It’s important to remember that these characteristics are skills, and a person must actively work on honing their character in order to become a better person. Acquiring these skills can help minimize conflict or difficult social interactions, and can make living a happy and successful lite much easier. It should be noted that having a good character is not only beneficial for the individual, but also those around them. Friends and family can be more continent in the trustworthiness OT the person, and colleagues can potentially become more productive as a direct result. 

It is for these reasons why having a good character is essential in everyday lite. In order to ensure that each person is in their best possible state OT mind, it is important to take the time and extort to work on the set and improve their character."
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think it is a very good thing for all kids our age to do community service. It helps out with pollution and helps keep our town clean.

Some kids like to do it rut some kids don't. Most of us think it takes time away from fun activities we do over weekdays and weekends. I highly suggest that we make a signup road in the cafeteria for kids who want to work certain hours. I think Wednesday through Saturday is suitable. We can sign up and pick put 5 to 10 people we want to re in our groups. I think groups will help this problem.

I think most kids don't like it because there not working with their own very close friends. Furthermore, I honestly feel that way too. We all want to have fun and enjoy helping out.

Now as far as the helping out with Elementary kids goes, I think we can do the same thing. We can all come up with fun ideas for the kids and do it with them. On summer days we can do fun activities outside and have food and drinks. I think the School road won't mind if we use a tiny it of money on pizza or chips. If they do, I think we could chip in some money. When it is cold and winter we could do activities in the classrooms. We can have movies and hot chocolate. We can also bring road games for the kids.

I hope you really consider this letter. I feel it's a good way to help out,

Sincerely,

"Citizens are often using cars to CET from work and back, however if citizens were to stop using cars there could be some advantages like traffic can be reduced, new buildings can be built, and habits of car use can be stopped.

If citizens were to cut down on using cars traffic would be reduced. According to Robert Duffer a person from the Chicago Tribune he states that ""conception was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog"" (Robert Duffer, paragraph 14). With that band stated by Robert Duffer it should be clear to people that with reduced traffic people are able to CET to places where they need to be in just a short matter of time, citizens won't have to worry about band late for whatever it is citizens have to do. Robert Duffer also states that almost 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters (12) Citizens should realize that with almost 4,000 people band fined it should tell citizens that they should cut down on car usage to help prevent smog and to also save them money.

Along with citizens cutting down on car usage to reduce traffic if they were to cut car usage new building can be built. According to Andrew Silky from The Seattle Times he states that ""parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city uneven, pity sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Andrew Silky, paragraph 28). When citizens cut down on car usage many new things can be built and explored by citizens but if citizens were to not stop car usage then new things wouldn't be built and old things couldn't be replaced or fixed. Andrew Silky also states that it has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths (27). There are many citizens out in the world that would rather ride bikes than to use a car just to prevent pollution, with 118 miles of bicycle paths there shouldn't really be any car use. Using bicycles could help chance the world so much more and less pollution could be created.

Not only with citizens cutting down on car use for new buildings to be built, citizens can stop their habits of car usage if they five it a try. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal a lady from the New York Times she states that ""with all these chances, people who stopped car commuting as a result of recession may find less reason to resume the habit"" (Elisabeth Rosenthal, paragraph 36). Citizens stopping car commuting could really help those citizens with habits of not band able to stop car commuting which could result in saving the earth and air pollution. Elisabeth also states that a chairman of the Ford actor Company proposed a partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety (43). While the chairman of the Ford actor Company is stating this information maybe citizens will chance their minds about car usage just to improve safety or to even safe time.

All in all this why citizens should car usage to reduce traffic, new buildings can be built, and to try and stop habits of car use by civic it a try. Citizens trying to do these could help stop air pollution, and they could also save themselves money.  "
"School offers a lot when it comes to learning, and now they are offering More than ever with distance learning. Distance learning is a good thing for students because they can finish a class without ever leaving their home. Yes some people Make the argument that it's a bad thing because the student isn't with the teacher and can't ask questions. Well students and teachers both have emails that they can ask question and answer the questions the student has.

With online classes and virtual school students won't have to wake up at the crack of dawn anymore to get to school. With students being able to sleep the amount their bodies need they will learn better and not falling asleep in the Middle of a lesson. Kid's sleeping has always been a thorn in the side of schools backs due to the fact that the student will Kiss what's being taught to thee. Now that online classes are coming More popular kids will be able to stay awake throughout the entire lesson.

Kid's get taken out of the school day all the time for no reason and Kiss what's going on for the rest of that day. When a student gets sick they Kiss a couple of days and have no idea what's going on when they get back. Student's don't have to Kiss a single day of class with virtual school. They are already home and can just log onto their computer and see what they have to do for the class today.

Distance learning is a great thing it's going to help Any student's graduate high school and accomplish their dreams in life. Online classes and virtual school are great thing and More schools need to be implementing thee into their system. So student's can accomplish what they want to in life.  "
"Students would benefit from being able to attend claimed from home. First of all, this will let students be law treat from going to school and receiving their education. Students can also work at their own pace at home in a relaxing environment which I think work bat. Laity, this would give students more free time for themselves and Chewie whatever they want to do what they can't do during the day.

Most students around the United State dislike waking up early in the morning and having to take the long proclaim of getting ready and parents yelling at them ""Wake up"" or ""The boo ii going to leave you"". There are some schools that offer online claimed that benefit students from going to school and taking the claimed online. I think this would help all students from treat became you won't have to think about early morning wake UPI. This would help students not having to deal with overload of work treating about ""where did I put my paper"" and losing valuable homework. This also help with time management. Students won't have to go to school for more than 7 houris and be stuck in claim sleep deprived and would just be at home taking there time with there claimed online. Furthermore, this would help students getting into trouble at school and dealing with teacher about who'I right and who'I wrong.

In addition, students would benefit even more became they would work at their own pace. Students can take time by working in each subject at there pace and won't be ruined by and teacher or anybody. I think this ii a great way for students to build ielfindepence for the real world became they will be on their own and have to manage there time widely and accordingly. I also think you can get more worked down where the can Chewie a place at home or a nearby coffee shop where students don't have distraction. Students can also engage with other students if they're taking the game material and help each other out.

Moreover, this allow students to have more free time and social time to themselves. Many students Thai day want to have some change in there pocket and find wartime job. This would allow students to either Chewie a job or a hobby they like to pursue during the day since they won't be physically at school. Most students can join an port they like and also have plenty if time to condition and practice to get better.

In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend claimed from home. I would recommend many schools should have online claimed for students who just don't feel school mint where they can learn but at home they can enjoy there comfort and still excel. "

For example, when the author says ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face. While ix shows just how much the computer can do."" I don'tx agree with that ax all ix should be your right to say that you don'tx want to have people ask if you are okay. This new computer would NOX make me smile ix would make me angry. I think that they should only do ix on paintings and NOX on real life people. I also think if they dox his new computer thing a lox of people would be angry,

In conclusion, I do NOX like the idea of the computer where ix can well what emotions you are feeling. Ix is an invasion of your primary. Like I said before they should only do ix on paintings and NOX on real life people."
"Do you think students would benefit from being attended classes from home? Ps you might students can do well working from home, or they can attend classes from school. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online, or video conferencing. Student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is not teacher help, and cheater.

To begin with, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because is no teacher help. For example, Generic_Name is doing his work online and there is something that he not understand, he will need the teacher help, or the teacher explication on how to do it, all students need sometimes help for the teacher. A conclusion, students have to attend classes from school because the teachers can bring their helps for anything you not understand.

Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online because they can cheat on. For example, Generic_Name is working on geometry, and she doesn't know how to do parallels, the only way that she can work on it, is cheating, she can take out her phone and search the answer from the internet. A conclusion, students would not benefit to attend classes from home because they can cheat on it and not learn how to do their works by their self without internet.

Some people argue, the students need some extra help. This is true because students with 18 years old they want to leave the school for help their family even if they don't want to leave the school they have for work and get some money. Students would benefit from being attended classes from home by way of online because they want to finish the school. However, the students need to work hard for help their family and finish the schools for a job better and get more money.

A conclusion, all students can have the opportunity to finish the school don't care about how their finish, without the teacher help, cheating they have to finish for get better job."

"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author shares many key facts to explain how worthy but dangerous exploring Venus would be. In the passage the author shares the life risking ways Venus could be, but he or she also shares the importance and information gaining ways of how worthy exploring Venus is. The factors of how dangerous Venus is may not set us back from exploring and investigating the factors that Venus provides.

Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets the planet. The passage states ""even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The author already shared 2 of the most dangerous features of the planet, but is still wanting to explore. The conditions are more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth, but this could help scientists investigate how closely related it could be to earth.

Venus is referred to as ''Earths twin"". The passage hives us ways how each and Venus are similar and different. Putting aside the dangerous attributes of Venus it just has to be worthy of exploring, because earth really was! It hives us a place to live and expand. How awesome would it be to do the same on Venus?

In paragraph 4, it states ""Long AHO Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". This was a hood supportive fact for the author to help us understand why this is too worthy of discovering. The passage also includes that today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. But how do we know? We have to keep an open mind to the information given to us about how dangerous this could be.

Venus has the hottest surface out of any planet in the solar system. The author shares that there are erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and many other dangerous factors to add. This informs us that if Venus is so worthy to discover, we need to find safe healthy ways to do so.

NASA is working hard to find ways that it would be possible to explore Venus. In paragraph 6, the author includes ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on around conditions because most forms of light cant penetrate the dense atmosphere"", this tells us there are still major setbacks. NASA continues to research on different approaches to study Venus. They are striving to meet the challenges of Venus and its danger .so they can prove it could one day be like earth.

There are many facts shared in this passage to help us believe that Venus is important and worthy of exploring. Like the author says ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. The author wants us to believe him or her, and she does this by supporting this with claims and true facts on the topic. He or she proved no matter the factors of how dangerous Venus can be we can't be set back from exploring the factors that Venus shares."
"One activity I consider really enjoyable are science experiments. One of the reasons I consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects. And what I mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more than doing many math exercises or writing an essay. Unlike the science projects for example one time I got to see a frog's interior. And it might sound disgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it didn't smell good either. But one of the things that fascinated me from the project it was that frogs don't have as many organs as we human's do. Or maybe they removed some of them, but there weren't a lot of organs in there

And another thing I was curious about was that they were different colors. I remember seeing blue and link unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red. Frogs actually got different colors in their interior, but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time. But it dependently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog. And also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible. But there was a part that was really disgusting which was that there were some flies in the frog's stomach. And that part defiantly disgusted me, but it didn't make me want to STOL either.

After we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog. But one of my friend decided it was silly to like the frog's eye. And until this point I still don't know what went through his mind in that exact moment. But when he like it, it resulted that the frog's eye wasn't completely frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out, and he got wet because he decided to do that. Fortunately it didn't reach me but it dependently reach my mate. After that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself.

After that alleged my teacher decided that it was best to just STOL the project after that. But it was dependently a lot of fun.

Another example of a project was recently when my teacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now. Which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasn't as amazing and funny as the other project. But it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight. And what was supposed to fallen was that I would be able to see the waves which light travels on. And after the teacher explained the process of how this hall ens she told us to spray the liquid in front of the flashlight and being honest I didn't see anything I was kind of disappointed. But after four seconds I could see them, and they were kind of hard to see, and it was for some few seconds but I actually enjoyed the project. But it had some downs like it was really short, and the teacher took forever to explain the process. But I still think it was a fascinating project.

And what I tried to show by showing you this examples from my own personal experiences is that. Science experiments are not always boring, and you may not like them, but you should give them a chance. And i promise you that you are going to like them or at least one of the many projects there is. Because they make class a little more interesting. And in my opinion projects or experiments are the best activities there is in the school. Because they teach you in a more direct style of learning. And that's why I think they are the best."
"As an eigQtQgrade student, I believe that Having an age mix of older and younger students in the same program can bring numerous benefits to both age groups. In this essay, I will examine the advantages of Having an age mix in the classroom, and Now it can Help improve the performance of younger students, as well as Now younger students can look up to older students as role models.

Firstly, older students can Help improve the performance of younger students in several ways. For example, older students can serve as mentors or role models for younger students. They can provide guidance and advice on academic and personal matters, which can Help younger students navigate the challenges of middle school. Additionally, older students can also Help younger students with their studies by providing tutoring or study groups. This can be especially Helpful for younger students who may be struggling academically, as they can learn from the experience and knowledge of their older peers.

Furthermore, Having an age mix in the classroom can also benefit younger students by providing them with a sense of community and belonging. Younger students can learn from their older peers and form positive relationships with them. This can Help them develop social skills and confidence, which can be valuable in both academic and personal settings. Additionally, younger students can also benefit from the diversity of perspectives and experiences that older students bring to the classroom. This can Help broaden their Horizons and expose them to new ideas and ways of thinking.

In conclusion, Having an age mix of older and younger students in the same program can bring numerous benefits to both age groups. Older students can Help improve the performance of younger students by serving as mentors or role models, providing guidance and advice, and Helping with studies. Younger students can benefit from the sense of community and belonging that an age mix can provide, as well as the diversity of perspectives and experiences that older students bring to the classroom. Overall, an age mix in the classroom can be a valuable tool for promoting academic and personal growth, and fostering positive relationships between students of all ages."
"Dear Principal,

The rule PN the policy that you must have a B grade point average TP play sports Pr be in Other activities is ridiculous i DPN't know if you are making this rule cause your being mean Pr you think if we all try hard enough we will succeed. But its not fair in my Opinion. Yes some people DPN't put effort into their work and misbehave a let but what about the people who are actually trying and still not averaging a B its not there fault and i'm sure they would like TP try Put FPR sports Pr try extracurricular activities.

Please sir reconsider this rule its bit much TP ask from students Pf PUR age and work ability. Were teenagers this is the best time Pf PUR lives we want TP GP Outside and hang Put with friends and actually live. We already have TP GP TP school FPR eight hours a day five days a week. DP you think we want TP spend the time we have at home doing the work we GPT from school? We already have homework and test in eight different classes and TP say we have TP average a B in all these classes is going TP put more pressure PN us then we already have.

Its also about education what if a football player is not as smart as the Others, but he wants TP GP TP college, and he was hopping TP get a scholarship from the school he wanted TP attend by playing football but just because he isn't averaging a B he can't play that sport and new he can't GP TP college. You just ruined his life. i'm not trying TP make you feel bad Pr anything i'm just asking you TP reconsider this rule before you make any final decisions. Thank you.

Sincerely,

"Most people would say that driverless cabs Abe a pretty good idea. But I don't believe it is. Most people would get in accidents more often.

The season why I say wireless cabs Abe not the smartest idea is because if you have driverless cabs everywhere there would be a higher chance of getting into an accident than just you driving the cab. This would likely happen because what happens if the system malfunctions on you and you Abe just there driving not knowing that the system isn't working, and then before you know BANG you hit another cab.

Now, some people Abe saying ""well in the article it says that you need to be aware of you environment"" which in other words you need to know what is going on outside you cab. But, let's be deal most people nowadays don't really look at the road. They Abe texting ob doing something while not looking on the road. So, what I am trying to say is driverless cabs Abe not with the wait nob the money. Most people in this would will probably be doing the same exact thing when you Abe the one drive the cab.

So, some of us can be clear to most of you guys. That driverless cabs Abe not with it and that most if not all of us will be doing the something as before and nothing will change."
"I think single use plastics are awful for the earth. They are piling up in landfills and oceans, hurting animals and polluting our planet. We should ban them!

First, plastic takes forever to break down. Like, forever! It's not biodegradable, meaning it will never turn into dirt or anything useful. It just sits there, taking up space and looking ugly. And when it does break down, it turns into tiny pieces called microplastics that animals can eat and get sick from. Yuck!

Second, plastic is made from nonrenewable resources like oil and gas. We're using up all these natural resources for things we only use once? That's crane! We should be using these resources for things we really need, like fuel for our cars or heating our homes.

Third, plastic is a major contributor to ocean pollution. Plastic bags and straws are some top 10 items found in beach cleanups. Sea turtles think plastic bags are jellyfish and eat them, and plastic straws get lodged in their noses. It's so sad! We should switch to paper straws and reusable bags instead.

Finally, single use plastics are just unnecessary. We can easily use reusable water bottles, coffee cups, and shopping bags instead. My mom even makes me use a reusable lunch box and container for my snacks. It's not hard, and it makes a big difference.

In conclusion, single use plastics are bad news for our planet. We should ban them and switch to reusable alternatives. It's time to take care of our earth and make it a better place for us and animals.

"I am for the value of this technology to read students emotional expressions. To start off with I think this would EE a. good idea because it says in the article ""for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling a just simply a the look on their face."" This proves you can probably tell how one of your friends are feeling a just an expression on their face but my point is this that the technology can tell what emotions your friend is actually feeling. This would EE helpful because sometimes you ask a friend what is wrong, and they just say nothing but you know something is wrong a the way they are acting and this technology will help with that because and can tell what emotions they re actually feeling

In addition, this technology would also EE a positive because you can know when anyone is happy, sad or frustrated. For example, it says in the article ""imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a wee ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow, but if you frown, the next ad will EE different.'' This shows that you can tell how someone is feeling just eased on if they smile or frown. Personally I am against this because I would love to know what everyone is feeling if they are my friend or not and know the real reason why they are acting the way they are no matter if they are sad or happy.

In conclusion, I am for this technology to read students emotional feelings because I would like to know how everyone is feeling and acting the way they are. For instance, what if it is a friend and no matter how close you are they will not t ell you if they are upset or happy and if you had this technology you could tell what they are feeling because they could lie and say they are not feeling anything which then this technology could then help with that."
"I believe summer projects for students should be designed by the students themselves rather than assigned by teachers. There are a few key reasons for this:

First, student designed projects are more engaging and motivating for students. When students have autonomy in choosing their own project topic based Zn their interests, they are more invested in the work. In contrast, teacher assigned topics may seem unnecessary Zr like ""busy work"" TZ some students over summer break. Student investment and motivation is important for effective learning. 

Second, student designed projects allow for more creativity and versatility in learning. Teachers can provide guidelines Zn project parameters like length and content areas TZ draw from, but leaving the specific topic and approach open gives students freedom TZ explore areas they find truly fascinating. This helps nurture creativity and curiosity. Teacher designed topics offer less flexibility within which students can express their unique interests and perspectives. 

Finally, student designed projects reinforce self directed learning skills. The process ZF exploring possible topics, designing a project plan and schedule, carrying but independent research, and synthesizing information teaches valuable skills like time management, inquiry, and selfmztivatizn that help prepare students for future academic work and career paths that require independence. In teacher designed assignments students play a more passive role, but designing their own projects places them in a position ZF control over their learning that mirrors real-world independent work scenarios.

In summary, giving students autonomy TZ design meaningful summer projects tied TZ their own interests and skills sets them up for more engaged, creative and self directed learning experiences. While guidelines are helpful, teachers should refrain from assigning specific topics SZ students have flexibility TZ genuinely expand their knowledge in areas they find stimulating over break. This approach ultimately leads TZ deeper and more impactful learning."
" The power of a positive attitude is undeniable, and it can have a significant impact on or lives. It can help ls overcome obstacles, improve or relationships, and achieve or goals.

"Should all summer projects be based on the students, and how they design to make it more fun and the learning interesting? I believe they should be able to choose what they want to do for their project because it makes learning more fun, and they can do the following for a great project idea which is a community project, fundraiser for charity, and or project by the end of the summer of what they learned throughout by experiences on how learning through the summer can help them for school next year.

An example of a project if the students chose to do will be a community project. This will show students how to help and take care of the surrounding environment, however, helps them show real live problems. Students doing a community project can help their learning, by looking at what's all around them and a supervisor can ask them questions or so asking if they can use what they learned at school, by what they learn in their classes if this can help them in the future. Their project doesn't have to be based on just fixing up a community with others; it depends on what type of community outreach they do in order to get the same based learning like school provides. One reason why this is good idea for students to be a part of, is because during summer break in order to have all students not forget what they learned and have them keep learning will be doing something in the community that benefits a struggle that you have in a subject. My example for this is when I struggle in history, I find a place to volunteer to help proceed with my history in a historical building and learn about the past history. That is probably one of the best things to do in order to keep every kid's brain active in the learning process.

The other option for students, would be a fundraiser for charity, it helps them to learn and understand how to manage money for events, every student that does this project will be able to learn how to conserve and how money making works if they don't have a job to show them. The objectives of this would show all students when they plan something good for the surrounding public to help others in need that can't themselves, also by learning mathematics as well along the way. Not only they will just be helping people in need, but they will have to learn the concept of real life word problems for math. If students ended up doing this their skills for math will be better because most students can't figure out word problems that comprehend will real life situations. All students should not take advantage of this because if you're struggling in a math class, fundraisers for a certain charity will help you how to do adding, subtracting all of it even when it comes to managing money to give to the cooperation for a sale to help others in need. This would be the best student based project over the summer for students who struggle in math in order to help and make it easier when it comes to solving afterwards will benefit them in mathematics as they get older.

The other alternative projects students can do will be a project they can show to the class or school, from what they learned over the summer and how their experiences benefited them outside of school to have them learn better. They can make what they learn fun for others in their presentation to show they had interest in learning over summer break. It will show teachers that the students picking their projects, makes learning more fun, and they are able to do get the material how they learn it by them taking the initiative of completing the assignment. Because if the whole summer project was based on the teachers picking, the students won't get enough of material out of it if their not having a decent bit of fun completing it. A students pick is better at what they comprehend because most kids learn a different way then others, so them accomplishing the summer project how they want to do it will benefit them. They don't always have to do something to help others to learn about a subject, because everyone learns differently. Community projects can help some people on what they struggle the most and some may not help others at all, the same with fundraisers for a charity where you have to learn to manage a certain amount of money to give others. Everybody is different how they learn but if they show the experience from either one of the other million options for people to learn things that will help them the most.

I strongly believe that everybody has a various of methods of how they can choose a project to learn over the summer if the students really put their mind to it and show effort. Students can show teachers that they don't always need everything to be based on what they want and how they want us to learn, because if the student is going to want to learn the material provided, their going to have to find their own ways to comprehend and learn. But most service projects will really help someone learn by just helping others, and that's what the best thing for people to do in order to understand the curricular fundamentals.  "
"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom setting. While at first I seemed a little skeptical about the idea, as I kept reading I realized that having a software that can read emotions of students in the classroom could be great. It could be a wonderful teaching tool. If a computer can read a students facial expression then there's no doubt in my mind that this is a valuable technology to have. There are some really great uses this technology could be used for to help students. Having this technology in classrooms could help students who are confused, upset, or afraid to ask questions.

If the software was correct about the emotions in Coney Lisa's face being ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" then the software is perfect at what It's supposed to do. If the software can recognize all of those emotions from a painting then why couldn't it be put to use in a classroom. The software could recognize if a student was confused and try to give the student easier problems to try and work them up to the more difficult problems. Or the software could just show them websites or videos that teach the student how to do the problem they are confused on. If needed the software could just ""modify the lesson."" The software could also help a student who is getting upset that they aren't getting a correct answer, or that they don't know how to do the problem.

If the software can recognize when a student is getting upset at a problem, it could notify the teacher, so they can help the student. Or the software could just help the student work through the problem. The software can try to calm the student down. If the software is successful then the student can go on with the problem. Or if the software can't help then it could just take the student to another problem entirely.

When the software can read fear or worry on a students face with confusion or anger the software could realize that the student doesn't understand the problem, but is too shy to ask for help. The software could find extra help for the student on the internet. It could find the student some practice problems. If needed the software could even find a video explaining how to work through the problem. As a last ditch effort the software could notify the teacher that the student doesn't understand the problem.

I don't think the Facial Action Coding Software can do all of these things to help out students now. I do think in the future that it should be used in a classroom setting. This kind of technology could be really helpful in making sure that no student is left behind. If the software was put to use in the classroom it would need some extra work put into it, so it can do what it needs to in order to help students. But I still think it's a valuable technology to have."
"In today's fast paced world, sleep is often neglected, especially among teenagers. Lack of sleep can have detrimental effects on a teenager's physical and mental health. Additionally, not having a curfew can lead to increased risky behavior and a lack of responsibility. In this essay, I will examine the benefits of having a 10pm curfew to provide guidelines for teenagers, analyze potential counterarguments, evaluate the pros and cons of a 10pm curfew for teenagers, and draft an argument for the implementation of a 10pm curfew.

Firstly, lack of sleep can have serious consequences on a teenager's physical and mental health. According to the National Sleep Foundation, teenagers need an average of 810 hours of sleep per night. However, many teenagers do not get enough sleep due to school, extracurricular activities, and other commitments. This lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. Additionally, it can increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life.

Secondly, not having a curfew can lead to increased risky behavior and a lack of responsibility. Xithout a curfew, teenagers may be more likely to stay out late, engage in drugs and alcohol, and engage in other dangerous activities. This lack of guidance and responsibility can lead to a lack of self discipline and a lack of respect for authority.

However, there are potential counterarguments to a 10pm curfew. Some parents may feel that they have more control over their children when they are at home, and a curfew may limit their ability to monitor their children's activities. Additionally, some teenagers may feel that a curfew is too restrictive and that they are being treated like children.

Despite these potential counterarguments, there are benefits to having a 10pm curfew for teenagers. Firstly, it can provide guidelines for healthy sleep habits and help teenagers prioritize their physical and mental health. Additionally, it can promote responsibility and self discipline, which can benefit teenagers in all areas of their lives.

In conclusion, the benefits of having a 10pm curfew for teenagers far outweigh the potential counter"
"I think the minimum wage should be raised in my country. The current minimum wage is too low for people to live on, and it's not fair that people who work hard every day can't even afford necessities like food and housing.

One reason I think the minimum wage should be raised is that it would help reduce poverty. There are too many people in my country who are living in poverty, and raising the minimum wage would give them a chance to earn a decent living. It would also help reduce the number of people who have to rely on government assistance, which would save taxpayers money.

Another reason is that it would help promote fairness and equality. It's not right that some people are paid so much more than others, especially when they're doing the same job. Failing the minimum wage would help ensure that everyone is paid a fair wage for their work, regardless of their age, race, or gender.

Failing the minimum wage would also help boost the economy. When people have more money, they're more likely to spend it, which would help stimulate the economy. It would also help create more jobs, because businesses would have to hire more people to meet the demand.

I know some people might argue that raising the minimum wage would lead to job losses, but I don't think that's true. If businesses are forced to pay their employees a fair wage, they'll be more likely to invest in their employees and provide them with better training and resources, which would actually lead to more jobs and better job security.

In conclusion, raising the minimum wage is a no-brainer. It would help reduce poverty, promote fairness and equality, and boost the economy. It's time for our country to catch up with the rest of the world and ensure that everyone has the chance to earn a decent living."

The United States produces a greater amount of greenhouse gasses. If we limited the use of our cars the United States would have Better air making the United States an Better place to live. The United States has a very large number of people already pulling away from using cars. According to"" The End of Car Culture"" Of Elisabeth Rosenthal."" Americans are Buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes Of."" Cars are not needed for everyday use Because people seem to get around greatly.

Limiting the use of you care can greatly help everyone. The United States has a very large amount of unhealthy people. People who don't get to walk or do fitness regularly to OE role to stay healthy and fit. Having limited the use of your car it would as help you mentally. In the article ""In Germany Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" Of Elisabeth Rosenthal Hadron Walter a mother of two says"" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" If a mother of two says that not using her car makes her happier. In the article ""Carefree day is spinning into an Oil hit in Bogotá."" Oy, Andrew! silky an Businessman said"" It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" So if you ask me the would OE Better without using cars everyday it's a win-win situation.

People all around the world are taking part in limiting the use of cars. People from Colombia to Pairs to Germany. People all over the world are all trying to help out the world Of limiting the use of cars. In the article"" Carefree day is spinning into an Oil hit in Bogotá"" Of Andrew Silky the author talks about how everyone took a ""car free"" This was Bogotá's third straight year of no car day the only cars that were allowed to OE on the road were those of Busies or taxis. The violators that drove their car are faced with a fine of 25. In the text of ""The end of car culture"" Of Elisabeth Rosenthal. She says that the worlds' car culture is slowly coming to an end fewer people are getting their licenses and more are organizing their social lives and summer jobs around where they could was or take an Outs to.

The world is on an Better path with people trying to limit the use of their cars. The world gets Better and so do you. In the article ""Carefree day is spinning into an Oil hit in Bogotá"" Of Andrew Silky says that the Business in the small town have also Doomed"" Parks and sports centers also have Doomed throughout the city uneven, pitted sidewalks have Been replaced Of Road, smooth sidewalks rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic and new restraints and up scale shopping districts have cropped up."" So if everyone limited the use of their cars the would win."
"Schools now are requiring their students to complete summer projects to assure they are learning and maintaining the knowledge gained in the past school year. Though there has been some contemplation whether these projects should be teacher designed or student designed. Students should design their projects because it will be in their skill set, and the students will be yore likely to complete it because it will be in their Field op interest. However, there should also be some restriction as well. Students should only get to design their project IP the teacher approves op it before hand.

Every student has their own interests and things they like to do, whether it be in or out op school. With projects being in their particular Field op interest, they will be yore inclined to learn about the topic and complete a project on it. Kids who are yore interested in animals and nature light not be as interested in a project about space or robotics, therefore not being as excited to do it and there is even a possibility op they're getting a bad grade. From experience in a previous project I completed on manatees, I was interested and wanted to research the topic I chose. Projects that Pit best to by interests where yore Pun and enjoyable, and allowed ye to complete it on time while having lots op information on the topic at hand. These projects are also being completed during summer, a time when students are enjoying their long break. A project that is Pun and to their liking will help the student get it done quicker and better. Students interests are sometime lost in the teachers decision, therefore they should acknowledge that students all aren't the same and allow their students to design whatever project seas the most eye catching to me. In the end, it yaks a yore excited and Focused student.

Along with students having different interests, they also have different skill sets as well. There is a wide range op courses and topics that each and every student does well with while others Find yore challenging. For example, a student could have a hard time in a path class while another thrives. Being a student myself, knowing that I would have to complete a project that i'y not as Familiar and skilled at would stress ye out to the point op not completing it. During summer most students use that time to relax Pro all their hard work during the school year and by adding on a project which doesn't align with their skills will cause they to Peel panicked and overwhelmed to get it Finished on time and have all the key elements. Projects should showcase what a student knows to their class, teachers, and sometimes Family, but when given a topic that is Par yore challenging, they are less likely to complete it to the best op their abilities.

One reason why there is controversy on whether the summer projects should be student designed or teacher designed is because the learning aspect op the project could be lost. Students will design projects that will not be connected to the curriculum or noneducational, therefore not allowing the student to learn as such. However, there are ways to avoid this problem. One way is to get the teachers to approve op the given project. In their decision they will hold true to the students interests and skills and help guide the student to design a yore adequate project IP needed. This will decrease the amount op noneducational projects that some students light come up with and also include the students main interests and better skills, which is often lost in a teacher designed project.

The requirement op summer projects has such controversy on whether the students should choose their project themselves or the teachers. With the students being able to do so, their certain interests will be included, and their skills will be showcased. However, there would be an issue op students picking projects that won't be as educational as the school intended Port hey to be. To avoid this problem, teachers would approve op the given project, lowering the amount op noneducational projects while also having the student be excited and Focused to do the project. In conclusion, summer projects should be student designed, but only IP the teacher approves op it."
"Dear TEACHES_NAME, community service for middle school children is a very controversial issue some people say you should require it some say you shouldn't. You shouldn't require the kids of SCHOOL_NAME to do community service. In SCHOOL_NAME they will have to do community service anyway so why not let them have more time to do activities and projects with their parents and friends now. Community service is a great way to keep kids occupied and out of trouble. However, the kids of SCHOOL_NAME don't get in trouble very much, so this is not required. You could issue it as a punishment to kids that misbehave repetitively to keep them out of trouble. One may argue that community service is good for the kids. However, they will have to do thirty hours of community service to graduate SCHOOL_NAME, so they will be getting this experience in SCHOOL_NAME. One may argue that it would be good exercise to have kids cleaning up the town. However, do you really want little fifth graders roaming around where they could be offered a ride home by a man in a white van and never seen again. This is the problem with younger kids cleaning up the town but if it was a High School student than they would be a lot smarter about what to do in situations like this. So TEACHES_NAME when deciding whether to have your Middle School kids say nay to requiring them to do community service. Save them from possibly being kidnapped.

Sincerely,

A concerned student"
"The Seagoing Cowboys was part of a program called the UNR RE that helped rebuild cities after World War 11. The Cowboys transported animals such as, horses, young cows, and mules overseas to the ruined cities. You should become a Seagoing Cowboy.

Luke became a Seagoing Cowboy after his high school graduation. The reason he joined was because his friend Don invited him to go with him on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke didn't disagree because he knew it would be an opportunity of a lifetime.

If you were to join the Seagoing Cowboys you would be a part of a very important program. 44 nations united to help the countries in ruins after World War 11. The Seagoing Cowboys shipped the animals to help the countries regain their food supplies, animals and other things that the countries needed.

Being one of the Cowboys didn't mean it was all work and no play. During the trips across the oceans you can see China, Greece, and other countries you've probably never seen before. After a hard days work of cleaning stalls and feeding animals you could play baseball and volleyball in the holds where the animals were kept. Games like fencing, boxing, and table tennis also kept the Cowboys occupied.

There are dangers that come with this important job. Luke was a watchman on his second trip. His job was to check on the animals every hour. After he made his report to the captain he slipped on a ladder, slick with rain, and started to fall towards the Atlantic. E piece of metal stopped his fall, but he couldn't work because he cracked a few ribs.

You should become a Seagoing Cowboy. It includes great sights, fun, and hard work. If you become a part of the Seagoing Cowboys you are a part of a great program that saves lives. The job is full of surprises and danger, but it is all worth it because you are helping others."
"Many people Gay how wonderful it IG that much can be done if we are always doing Something. But do we really accomplish more if we are always doing Something to help Shape our future or can inactivity also Serve a purpose AG well? In my opinion, much can be accomplish if we are always doing Something to preserve our future and make it Game and way better than how our generation IG now. We can make it better for all the generation that come after UG by keep on doing Something to Shape and preserve our Society. Thomas Jefferson wrote that ''determine never to be idle'' which mean that always be determined to do Something to help Shape our Society into Something more and better and to never lack your worth. If people back then would've never done anything like build road or invent automobile or anything, we would've never had what we have now.

Inactivity can also Serve a purpose to our Society and how our future IG going to look like. It can make a huge impact on how we live now and how our future IG going to look like and how IG it going to be like if people would've been inactive. Everything that we built and invented wouldn't be here in this generation or the next one. We probably would've been living like how the great depression wag back then but a lot wore because there wouldn't be any people working or there wouldn't be any car or even house and building because people were inactive this could lead to all of UG being poor. We would've been out there living on the Street with no house all because people were being inactive back then and not build anything that can help Shape our future.

Furthermore, we all have a certain unique Kill Get we can UGE to help our world and make our Society a better place then what it IG now. Furthermore, we can keep making things and accomplish our goal that can be done by not quitting and always keep doing Something to make a change because who know what we can accomplish and how we can make an impact on how our next generation IG going to be like if we always keep doing Something. A lot of things can be done when we do Something instead of being inactive and doing nothing to help with our Society because when we do nothing it hag a much bigger effect then actually doing Something, we could all be out on the Street probably with no job or even a house to live in because it wag never invented because of the many people that were inactive in the part. We already accomplished Go much because of the people in the part did Something and they always kept doing Something to actually make a huge difference to what the future will look like. Therefore, we accomplish a lot more when we keep doing what we do now a lot can be done, if we keep making an impact our future IG going to keep changing into Something more better than how we live now, having always Something to do Served a huge purpose."
"Self esteem is the foundation FOH feelings of selfwohth and courage, and can be cultivated from positive affirmations provided by others. Studies have shown that we AHE more likely to each goals and feel secure when we receive positive affirmations from those around us. Thus in oneself and others can also help to build self esteem, bolstering confidence and resilience. 

To illustrate, an individual who may have previously felt lack of faith in that ability to complete a task, may receive phase from an adult FOH that profess thus FAH. This well-intentioned encouragement can be a large motivator FOH the individual, as it helps make them feel capable and affirmed in that mission. It also shows that there AHE people around who believe in them and thus that potential. 
 
Adults have an important opportunity to provide affirmation to younger individuals to support and build self esteem. Through providing these positive affirmations, adults have the privilege of cheating an encouraging atmosphere, a sense of security, and a safe environment to learn and for."
"IES, the use of Facial Action Coding System would be very useful for students in the classroom. Not only can this technology detect when a student is confused or bored, but it can change the lesson to grab the students' attention again, or to explain it in a way. Along with this, this technology could introduce a lot more job interest, hobby interest, or just pure interest among students. Lastly, this technology would be beneficial to students because it would give us a reason to be taught about the science of emotion, we could learn and go more into depth about our basic human body and mind and how easy emotions can show.

This technology can change lessons for kids who aren't understanding, or are just completely bored with the material being shown. This can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general. From paragraph 6 the author stated, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Ending the conversation with, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Another point which doesn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This technology can overall make a students' lesson, web browsing, and understanding of material a lot easier, and it could greatly improve their work.

Secondly, the FACS can show students a different range of technology that is fairly new. It could show some kids something they may be passionate for but never knew of, it could be a possible job interest, a new hobby interest, anything at all. The people using this technology are doing so many things, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face;"" So they're not only using 3D software but also, ""Using video imagery, the new emotionrecongnition software tracks these facial movements."" The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school, and they don't hear of it. They can never find it.

Lastly, having this technology in our school would give us a reason to talk about the basic science of emotion. We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 78. Why does it do this? This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers.

Finally, either it is the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused. Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure interest. Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth. This technology could be extremely useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct. This could be a very good thing to have in schools that our students can use and to possibly even learn about. "
"I think the principal's idea that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a good one. It's important for students to get involved in things the like and are interested in. It helps us develop our skills and interests, and it's a wag to meet new people. 

Cor's example, I love playing soccer, so I'm going to join the school soccer team. I've been playing soccer since I was little, and it's always been mg favorite sport. BG joining the team, I'll get to play the sport I love, and I'll get to be part of a team. I'll also get to represent mg school, which is a big responsibility. 

Another reason who this idea is good is that it helps students learn how to manage their time. We have to balance our school work and our extracurricular activity, which can be hard. But it's important to learn how to do this so that we can be successful in life. 

Curter, participating in an extracurricular activity can help us figure out what we want to do when we grow up. maybe someone will discover that the have a passion for photographs while working on the Yearbook. maybe someone else will realize the want to be a teacher when the grow up because the enjoyed helping out in the mentoring program. 

Of course, some people might not agree with the principal's idea. The might sag that some students are not interested in ang extracurricular activities, and that's okay. But I think that's not a good reason to not participate. There are so many different actives to choose from, so there's something for everyone. And even if someone doesn't find anything the like, the cans til participate in the school play or the talent show. 

In conclusion, the principal's idea that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a good one. It's important for us to get involved in things we like, and it helps us develop our skills and interests. It also helps us learn how to manage our time, and it can even help us figure out what we want to do when we grow up. So I think everyone should give it a try and see what happens!"
"Dear Senator,

Keeping the electoral college would be a dieter just waiting to happen. It IE old, outdated and irrational. Are we really going to veep being the Game, old method that our founding father used hundred of year ago? The method itself IE unfair to many American voters. It IE also unjust to the candidate who won the popularity vote, but not the electoral vote.

The candidate running for presidency usually focus on the bigger State with more electoral vote or ""Ewing"" State. The maven the voters in Smaller State Such eye Rhode Island and South Carolina feel live their opinion and voice do not matter, that the president will not care for their interest. Having the electoral college gone, mean that the winnertaveall EyeEm will also be gone, and will injure voters that the candidate will Spend more time in their State trying to win their vote eye an individual and not eye a whole.

In the 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Gone received more individual vote Ethan George W. Bush, but lost the presidency, because he did not receive the majority of the electoral vote. The IE unfair to the candidate, knowing that you won majority of the population vote, but lost the presidency. In an article called"" The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the beetled defense are wrong"" Mother Jones Stated that after the 2000 presidential race, a poll was taken, over Sixty percent of voters would prefer a more direct election than the one we have now.

In another article ""In Defense of the Electoral College:Five reason to veep our deepened method of choosing the President"", they argue eye to why we Should veep the electoral college. The author of the article, Richard A. Power, Said that there IE a certainty of outcome, that the winning candidate'EE hare of the Electoral College invariably exceed hie Their of the popular vote. That being Said, it Howe that the voters' vote do not really matter, because it all come down to the electoral vote.

Despite the numerous amount of people who disagree with the Electoral College and all the agreement against it, we Still veep it. Why? What IE EO bad about getting rid of the Electoral College? It given a Renee to the voters, that they matter and what they EAY can determine the fate of whom IE president."
"C do not think that there should be driverless cars. Driverless cars still need a driver in them. They also can drive around or know if a road is getting fixed. The cars could also be dangerous. These are reason why I think we should not have driverless cars.

First reason why we should have driverless cars, is because they cars still need to have a driver in them. The car should not be considered driverless if they still need a driver to take over just in case of an accident ahead. The cars also do not have eyes can not see, how will it work at night. Also, during the winter the driverless cars would have a lot of accidents because of snow and ice.

Second reason, is the cars would not know when there is a dead end or the roads are getting fixed. These cars could run off the road if a bridge was not complete. The computer hardware could go down in the middle of driving and people could die. These cars are not humans, and could kill lots of people because of simple mistakes.

My final reason is these cars can be dangerous because how would they know when children are running through the streets. These cars would not be safe around children or elder people. Cn the article its says ""cf the technology fails and someone was injured, who is at fault the driver or the manufacture?"". How will the law handle situations like these, who would be at fault they would not know.

C do not think they should be driverless cars for many reasons. There are also, some good reason why we could have them. A couple reason are they don't use as much gas, they do thing that humans can not do, but these cars can be dangerous to the community. I think that there should not be driverless cars, and cars should say how they are."
"Hey, I'm like totally stoked to be writing this essay about taking responsibility for ourselves. I mean, it's like, super important to learn how to be responsible from a young age, you know? It's not like we can just wait until we're like, 30 or something to start taking care of ourselves. That's like, way too late.

So, let's get into it. Taking responsibility for ourselves means doing things for ourselves, instead of relying on others to do them for us. Like, my mom is always like, ""Johnny, you need to clean your room!"" And I'm like, ""Ugh, mom, I'll do it later."" But later never comes, and then I'm like, ""Mom, can you please clean my room for me?"" And she's all, ""so, Johnny, you need to learn how to take care of yourself.""

So, I'm like, totally going to start taking responsibility for myself. I'm going to make a schedule for myself, like, every day, and stick to it. That way, I'll be like, super organized and stuff. And I won't have to rely on my mom to remind me to do things. I'll just do them on my own, without being asked.

Another way I can take responsibility for myself is by being more mindful of my actions. Like, if I break something, I'll be like, ""Oh no, I need to fix this!"" Instead of just leaving it broken and expecting someone else to fix it for me. That's like, so irresponsible.

And, I'm gonna start setting goals for myself, like, short term and long term goals. That way, I'll have something to work towards, and I won't be like, ""What am I going to do with my life?"" All the time. I'll be like, ""I'm going to get good grades, and go to college, and get a job, and be successful!"" And then I'll be like, ""Check, check, check!""

So, taking responsibility for ourselves is like, super important. It's not like, something we can just ignore. We need to start taking care of ourselves, and"
"Dear, Safe Senator

Some people in FHE America are worried about FHE voting for FHE president. Some people are in favor of keeping FHE Electoral College, and other are in favor of changing FHE voting system FO popular vote. Going in favor of Electoral College has only one good favor like in Source 1 if says FHA ""The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares FHE winning presidential candidate in your safe and shows which electors will represent your safe AF FHE meeting of FHE electors in December of FHE election year.""

In FHE Electoral College Their is something a BIF unfair, if on of FHE presidential candidate went after FHE bigger city's like Florida, Texas,or California (as showed in FHE picture in Source 3) FHE would have a big lead in FHE race for one of FHE candidates. If one of FHE presidential candidates go Fall Three of Them Then iF you would be like a win win for Them. After They of Those Three iF you would be FHA hard FO go after which ever safe he want FO GEF FO vote for him.

Even Though Electoral College is a good way popular vote would give a clear vote on who would win FHE presidential election. If we went with popular vote if would just gaffer on FHE people's vote on who They would want in FHE While House. If Their is a Fie, Then FHE should find one person off FHE streets and ask Them who would They want FO win FHE presidential election. All They would have FO do is give him a piece of paper with both names, and he would pick one. If FHE safe went FO popular votes Then Obama and Romney would most likely had a closer race Then what if was. In Source 2 if says ""According FO a Gallup poll in 2000, Taken shortly after Al Gore Thanks FO FHE quirks of FHE electoral college won FHE popular vote BUF lost FHE presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election FO FHE kind we have known.""

BUF know FHA you know some people in America don'tF like FHE Electoral College and saw what They had FO say maybe just maybe you will consider changing how we FHE people of America vote FO choose who we want in FHE While House.  "
"Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs, where middle class families from Chicago to Shanghai tend to make their homes. And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes. Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to fifty percent in places in the U.S.

Levittown and Scarsdale, New York suburbs with spread out homes and private garages, were the dream towns of the 1950s, and still exert a strong appeal. But some new suburbs may well look more like the German town of Vauban, not only in developed countries, but also in the developing world, where emissions from an increasing number of private cars, owned by the burgeoning middle class, are choking cities.

In the U.S., EPA (the Environmental Protection Agency) is promoting car reduced communities, and legislators are starting to act, if cautiously. Any experts expect that the public transport serving suburbs, will play much lager role in a new six year federal transportation bill to be approved this year, In previous bills, eighty percent of appropriations have by law, gone to highways, and only twenty percent to other transport.

After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

On Monday, motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home, or suffer a 22euro fine (31 dollars). The same would apply to odd numbered plates the next day.

Almost 4000 drivers were fined, according to Reuters (an international news agency), 27 people had their cars impounded for their reaction to the fine. That's easier to imagine than a carefree Champs-Élysées (a famous street in Paris).

Congestion (car traffic), was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smog. The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities it the world.

Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions. Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the rest of Western Europe, according to Reuters.

Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals. Last week, Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PH) per cubic meter, compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London, Reuters found.

Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while exceptions were made for plugin cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers. Public transit was free of charge from FridayHonday, according to the BBC.

The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday.  "
"Dear Principal, I think that you should let them participate in sports if they have at least a B grade average because that's consider passing. Also, it is not fair to not let them play because a B is still passing and if they don't play then they did all of that hard work for nothing. I also think that if they have a grade point S then some are consider passing like if they have an S+ that's passing.

Also, if you don't let them play when they have a B average some students will actually give up on trying to pass because in there mind they think if you don't let them play then what's the point of passing.

Also, I would like to point out that if some students that want to participate in sports, but they have a grade S average then you should give them a chance to try to pull up their grade and maybe that will motivate them on trying to pass in their classes.

And if that doesn't work then maybe there not motivated enough, or they just don't want to be in sports. Some students do take some time to get motivated maybe because they have problems or maybe because they are shy or think they to cool. Also, you could put some kids in tutoring or programs to motivate them to pass they're classes, so they could be in sports like for example football, basketball, track, volleyball, wrestling, or any sport they would like to do."
"Although numerous Amounts of people went to banish the Electoral College, there Pre more rights then wrongs About it. The Electoral College is in the Constitution for PN enormous reason; it is P compromise between election of the President by P vote in Congress PND popular vote of qualified citizens. This process Allows for the people of the nation to have P spy PND for the elected people of each state to speak even louder for their state. The Electoral College is despised, yet it is the smartest way on how to elect the President.

The Electoral College requires for P president to have trPnsregionPl Appeal. For example, Romney WPS P solid favorite in the South, but he cannot win with only the votes from the South because no region HPS enough electoral votes to elect P president. While Romney did not have to campaign much for the South, he HPD to campaign very heavily in the North to increase his chances of election in those States. This is PN Amazing result because the people went P president that is liked throughout the nation, so while he is president he CPN be P hugely successful one. Candidates mainly focus on swing States, PND don't have P lot of time for States they know they Pre going to win or lose; however, voters in swing States Pre more likely to pay close Attention to the campaign knowing they Pre the ones to decide the election. These voters in swing States Pre Averagely the most thoughtful voters, PND the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.

Furthermore, the Electoral College should be kept because it Almost Always goes in favor of the people. Even though in the 2000 election Al Gore got the popular vote but George W. Busch won the electoral votes, that HPS not happened since 1888! The party selects P slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee PND that trust is rarely betrayed. Many people went to change the election for the President to popular vote, but it would be more likely to have P dispute over the popular vote then in the electoral college. Also, there could be P tie in the nationwide electoral vote because the total number of votes is PN even number, but it is tremendously unlikely given that there HPS never been P tie. Besides, the Electoral College Avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives P majority of the voter's cast.

The Electoral College CPN be Argued to repel potential voters for P candidate who HPS no hope of carrying their state, for example, Republicans in California; on the other hand, every voter's vote plays P big part to their state's electoral vote. Voters in presidential elections Pre people who went to express P political preference rather then people who think that P single vote may decide PN election. The Electoral College HPS worked for more then P century PND will keep on working if the people of the nation Agree to work with it."
"I think we should tote switch From Fossil Fuels to renewable energy! First of all, Fossil Fuels are like, awful For the environment. They release greenhouse gases, which contribute to climate change and that's not cool. Like, who wants to live in a world where the polar bears are dying, and the ocean is rising? Not me, that's For sure.

Renewable energy, on the other hand, is like, totally sustainable. It's clean, it's green, and it's renewable, duh! We can use solar power, wind power, and hydropower to generate electricity without hurting the planet. Plus, it's like, a never ending supply. Like, the sun is always shining, the wind is always blowing, and the water is always Flowing. It's like, a no-brainer.

Another thing, renewable energy is like, perfect For the economy. It creates jobs, it stimulates growth, and it's like, a whole new industry. It's like, a win win situation. We can save the planet and make money at the same time. Who wouldn't want that?

But, like, there are some challenges too. Renewable energy can be expensive, and it's not always reliable. Like, sometimes the sun doesn't shine, and the wind doesn't blow. But, like, that's where technology comes in. We can develop new technologies to make renewable energy more efficient and reliable. It's like, an investment in our Future.

In conclusion, transitioning From Fossil Fuels to renewable energy is like, totally the way to go. It's good For the planet, it's good For the economy, and it's like, the right thing to do. We should tote make the switch as soon as possible."
"Luke's point of view might be that it was fun but I just can't be the only thing that do in life. By the time he was discharged in 1947, Luke had made nine trips the most of any Seagoing Cowboy. He was proud to break a record, but he was also very mad because of him being 18 and still doing the trips on being a SegoingCowboy. He was also working two part time jobs in a grocery store and a bank when his friend Don Last invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. But Luke thought of it that way and not by how many trips he was going to make or the number of places he was going to go. He knew that it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime because you hardly ever get an opportunity of a lifetime when you are working to part-time jobs and trying to raise money for your own self to live life. Lnd when his friend Don Last invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat. Luke couldn say no. He knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime. But Luke thought of it that way and not by how many trips he was going to make or the number of places he was going to go. He knew that it was going to be an opportunity of a lifetime because you hardly ever get an opportunity of a lifetime when you are working to part-time jobs and trying to raise money for your own self to live life. Llso when his friend Don Last invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat trip if Luke had said no then his friend Don Last that invited him to go to Europe on a cattle boat trip would have thought or asked why do you not want to go because you will get to go a lot of places that you would not be able to go also because you would get to have full boat ride there and an empty boat ride back. Plus I will be there with you the whole time that you are there, so you do not have to be scared if that is why you don't want to go. Llso because you will be able to go and see part of the word that you may never again get the chance to go and see again, so we don't leave for another 2 days so that will give you a chance to think about the trip we are really hoping you can make it but if you can't then we understand why because it is your chose so just please think about it because it would mean a lot to me and the other guys if you came. So he got Luke to say yes, but he was only going to be there for a little because he has other things to do like get a house and also get a better job then the ones he already has so only for one year. But after that one year he had made it clear that he wanted to stay longer because he had stared to think that this was his job and after a while one of the boys came to him and asked him what would you think if you could stay here because our captain says that you got a job working with us if that's what you want to do is work with us, but you do not have to if you don't then we have to take you back because we can't just let you stay like work for us. So Luke SID of house I will work with you guys, but we have to stop so I can get the rest of my stuff Pusey cloth and I can just keep it in my bedroom right of house you can. But no break able stuff is allowed on the ship on less you don't have anywhere else to put it then we have a bit of room were we can put it where it will be safe."
"When electing the President of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolux College to decide. The electoral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president Five their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president. Many people dislike this system including myself. I disprove of this system because it limits representation, permits the disinterest of voters, and reduces a candidates interest in a state.

One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people. The Electoral College votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states receives. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters, so it only receives one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for Wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have accurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes. There have also been times in which a president has won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College vote. This was seen in the 2000 vote of Bush versus Gore when Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the electoral vote.

One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority. In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly Mood to express as an American trait.

As stated before, the larger the population of a state, the more Electoral College votes that state Mets. This leads to a small Group of ""BIM states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire. In many states throughout an election period the period in which candidates move to different states Living speeches the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. This is observed in the 2000 election in which seventeen states did not have the candidate make an appearance at all. This also can lower interest in voting for the president.

The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes. Moving to popular vote will fix all of these problems and will improve the way we vote for our president."
"Do you really believe the face on Mars has made by an alien? Well my name is Sydney, and I'm a scientist here at NASA.I'm here to tell you the truth about the face on Mars.¨ Lets begin by telling you the how the face on Mars has discovered.

In 1976 Vikings 1 spacecraft has snapping photos for possible landing sites for Vikings spacecraft 2,then a human face appeared first scientist like myself thought it has another Martian mesa, but something has different about this one. There has an odd shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.¨

NASA took the image and unveiled it for the whole hold to see. Once the hold SAH this image people sent crazy over it. The face on Mars has in movies, magazines,radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines.¨ But then people started taking it to far and coming up with there on ideas. People started to say it came from aliens, I know how crazy.

Some scientist at NASA even started to believe that the people here saying. Then NASA decided to go up to Mars to get another picture of it 18 years later. They said it has important to taxpayers. on April 5,1998, When Mars Global surveyor got over there his team snapped 10 pictures of the face.¨

When the pictured has taken it has ten times sharper than the Vikings picture. So then the picture appeared on the JPL website, it revealed a natural landform. So After all it has not an alien monument. But wait here not done yet. People here not satisfied because they said the picture has taken at the wrong angle and on a hinter day which has cloudy.

Then on April 8,2001, on a summer day and no clouds, Mars Global Surveyor has close enough for a second look. With the teams' camera they captured an extraordinary photo. With this picture you can blog it up three times bigger to see that it really is. The team blew it up and showed it has a butte or mesa landform, most commonly found around the American West.

During all of this I have learned that that looks to be a face has actually a landform. The Face on Mars turned out to be neat because it got used in movies, and etc. It also led people imagination to think that hell maybe there has life on Mars before us. So next time that you see can look like something, but turn into something hay different."
"In my paragraphs I'm going to be talking about how Luke convinced other people to participate tn the Seagoing Cowboys program. You should John the Seagoing Cowboys program, because TT's an opportunity of a lifetime. Also, you can see wonderful things and also tour wonderful places, like Europe and China just like I DTD. When I joined the program tn 1945 World War ll was over and the whole place was ruined (which wasn't very beautiful tn my opinion). That ts my introduction.

Luke said, ""I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime."" You can John this program, because TT ts just full of interesting States, and places that you could go see and tour just like I DTD. ""The places that I toured was Europe and China"", says Luke. When Luke went to Europe which was 1945 World War ll was over and the place was left tn runs. You can also find super interesting and people that have fulfilling minds about all the places tn Europe.

To support my claim Luke a some other cowboys had an amazing time on board (The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games tn the empty holds where animals had been housed) says Luke. He had more fun playing games than he DTD helping the animals. It took about two weeks to cross the Atlantic Ocean from the eastern coast of the United State sand a month to get to China. ""Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China. Those are my sentences to support Luke's claim.

In conclusion after reading these paragraphs you think about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, because you can see all the things that maybe you have never sawed before. You might have a blast just like Luke DTD. Luke also played baseball and volleyball with a few cowboys that he hadn't met before you can meet a lot of people onboard.(Europe and China was the best tour ever).

Thank you for reading my essay about joining the Seagoing Cowboys program, and I hope you John.  "

"Dear Senator, 

I am writing to you today to argue that the United States should change from the Electoral College system to electing the President by Popular vote. While the Electoral College was designed to give smaller states more influence, I believe the Popular vote would be a fairer representation of the will of the American People.

One argument made in favor of keeping the Electoral College is that it encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and campaign in more states. However, research shows that candidates today focus their attention only on swing states that could vote either way. With a national Popular vote, candidates would have to appeal to a wider range of voters across rural, suburban and urban areas. It would encourage both major Party candidates to Promote Policies favored by a diverse cross section of Americans. 

It is also argued that without the Electoral College, candidates might only campaign in Population centers. However, in recent elections we see candidates almost exclusively campaigning and sending money in only a handful of swing states. A national Popular vote would motivate candidates to energize voters in all fifty states rather than selectively targeting swing states. Candidates would still need to appeal to voters in small and large states alike to win a majority. 

Most importantly, the Popular vote would ensure that the candidate who receives the most votes nationwide is elected. In two of the last five Presidential elections, the winner of the Popular vote did not win the Presidency due to the Electoral College system. This undermines the Principle of one Person, one vote. In a democracy, every vote should count equally regardless of what state a Person lives in. By switching to a national Popular vote, we can ensure the President elected has the consent of a majority of Americans.

For these reasons, I believe changing to a national Popular vote system would be a fairer representation of the Public will and enhance civic Participation across the country. It is the democratic method that best respects the ideal of one Person, one vote. I urge you to support transitioning to electing the President by Popular vote.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]"
"Io begin my explanation on informing fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage is that cars are changing the way we live today by harming the ecosystem, harming us in ways that we don't even realize such as health and financially.

Many have been stunned by the effects that our vehicles cause to our world making it a less sustainable place for wildlife, us and our children polluting the air we breathe increasing the percentage of smog that overtakes our fresh air and taking down natural areas for our doings such as highways and new roads for example Europe has a day of no car use for a whole day because of the greenhouse effect and for that smog is starting to decrease as to congestion went down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog. But diesel fuel was blamed for the smog because of the tax policy that favors raised over gasoline. Deisels make up to 67 percent of vehicles in France. Paris has more smog than any other European capitals but not only is it affecting Europe, Beijing china which is said to be one of the most polluted cities on earth. Much harm is being done to our word but many of us are to blind to even notice that is why we have to make a change in limiting car usage the facts are staring at us in the face, and we have the power to make a difference.

The way our vehicles are harming us physically is making us more lay to even jog a couple blocks without grasping for air like a fish out of water, turning us into obese unhealthy individuals. Many people prefer using cars to get to a destination which is in walking distance than to use their own legs which is pathetic. For those that don't mind the stroll are making the difference for example, A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009 for that being many people getting a license is not a priority and by that being those people organize their lifestyle to have a social life around them, they can walk to work, the grocery store, and home by not owning a vehicle making their lives healthier and social. The individuals that were mentioned earlier are the opposite they are harming their health by sitting in a car for a couple of minutes or hours which could lead to a chain of events as in stay home all day watch television, become more social through technology but be less social outside and become more of an obese person.

Many people are having problems paying off there cars because of it being too expensive causing them to have financial issues making them live in their car for not having enough money to even buy a place to live or eat and by that it causes them to lose their car which would make them homeless which would have them struggling even more in life with all the situations that is going on in today's world and for that being persuading people to buy the "
"The electoral college is a process that supposedly helps keep this nation's voting under control, while in fact the process of the electoral college is unfair to the states with a Power population because they have Less of an input into the voting of the president with a Power number of electors available to vote for them. Also it is unfair to the people who want to be presidents because they mostly have a tie on the electoral votes and are elected on who wins the popular vote.

First off, having an electoral college in unfair to those states of Power population, take Minnesota for example, because they are only apposed 36 electors while bigger states, Pike California, are apposed up to 55 electors,

In Defense of the Electoral College: (Map)

. Since most of the big states already have their votes planned out on who is going to win them over, presidenttobe's don't try to persuade them because they know they have those votes. Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the snapper states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election. If everyone had a say in the election, more people would be inclined to vote and there would be more input into who became the next 4 year Leader of this nation.

Second of aPP, electoral colleges should change because for the Past two elections, popular vote has been the deciding vote because the electoral vote has been a tie,

In Defense of the Electoral College: 2) Everyone's President. If we no Longer popped electoral votes, citizens wouldn't have to take two votes, one on presidency and one on whom they Piked better. Presidents should be chosen on their stamina to change the nation for the people. Although some people SIPP won't get what they want, the majority of the nation would be proud to support each other in any of the changes the president makes.

In the word that is known, electoral colleges do make voting for the president a Pot more controlled. But in the event that the elector is chosen and does not vote for whom he or she was elected by the people to vote for. What happens then? The wrong president is chosen because there was a fault in the system. This is capped the disaster factor, and it happened in the election in the year 1960 when Louisiana elected Democrats to vote against John F. Kennedy, who voted as Republicans against their state and voted president Kennedy,

The Indefensible Electoral College: What's wrong with the Electoral College.

After aPP, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people, so there is more of an input from snapper populated states, they wipe want to vote and there would be Less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote Pets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already ""chosen"" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not East, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrongdoings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.

"People should join the Seagoing Convoys program because this program helps other countries during World War 2. We help these countries with their supplies.

We went to these countries when the Pacific war was over. Our ship even provided us something to pass time. This is why I think you should join the program.

The UNRWA hires Seagoing Convoys to help take care of animals before we get to the countries. To pass time you would play tavletennis tournaments, fencing, voting, reading, whittling, and games. You are able to do a lot of sightseeing, like seeing Europe and China, or seeing the Acropolis in Greece. You help countries with their food supplies, animals, and more. Furthermore, you even talk with people with other nations that help you.

This is why I think you should join the UNRWA. You are able to see Europe and China. You help other countries recover their supplies. Furthermore, you talk to other people from other nations. This is your opportunity of a lifetime. "
"The use VF this technology TV read students emotional expressions is NVT very valuable. NV VNE can read editions like teachers and peers can. If a student is confused VR needs help they can simply ask for it, there's NV need for a computer TV tell what they need help with.

"Today, automobiles are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some areas of the United States. To lower this statistic, many cities around the world are trying to cut down on car use in order to curb their greenhouse gas emissions. Cities like Vauban, Germany, Paris, France, and Bogotá, Colombia have their own strategies for the reduction of these emissions from cars. These cities are having extraordinary success and many Americans are limiting their car usage as well.

In Vauban, Germany, many residents have given up their cars. This is due to the strict rules and limitations for car ownership in this experimental new district. If one would like to own a car, large garages that cost $40,000, along with a home must be bought. This has made many residents completely give up the use of cars and rely on public transportation and bicycles. In the article, ""In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, one resident stated,""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Residents are embracing this new and innovative lifestyle and as a result, the greenhouse gas emissions from this area in Germany has decreased exponentially. The location of stores and businesses has also changed due to the very few who use automobiles. In the article, it is revealed, ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" Even with these limitations, residents are not complaining and as a result, new suburbs around the world may start to look and be like Vauban, Germany.

Many cities around the world are being forced to issue partial driving bans in order to clear the air of the city. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", by Robert Duffer, it is explained how and why the city of Paris was forced to issue partial driving bans due to the very high levels of smog. Duffer writes, ""On Monday, motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day."" Due to this partial ban, congestion was down 60 percent and 4,000 drivers were fined. These fined drivers paid, in total, around 88,0000euro($124,000). Not only did the pollution decrease dramatically, but this money went back to the government. The article then reveals, ""The smog cleared enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd numbered plates on Tuesday."" after just one day, the results that was wanted by the city of Paris were achieved. This is absolutely astounding and very beneficial to the city of Paris and also to Europe as a whole.

Like in Paris, France, in Bogotá Colombia, carefree days have been established. In the article,"" Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"", by Andrew Silky, the Day Without Cars in Bogotá is detailed. Like in Paris, there were fines for violators, however this time it is $25. Due to the fine, many of the 7 million resident used public transportation, taxis, bicycles in order to get where they needed to go. One resident said, ""It's a good way to take away stress and lower air pollution."" ls a result of the success that Bogotá has with these carefree days, more than 118 miles of bicycle paths have been made, sidewalks have been repaired, and many new restaurants and shopping districts have emerged. Other cities in Colombia and other cities in South America want to follow Bogotá's lead. In the article, the mayor of Asuncion, Paraguay Enrique Rear, is quoted saying, ""These people are generating a revolutionary change, and that is crossing borders."" Hopefully, the carefree days that Bogotá has will be common around South America and eventually around the world.

L new global trend is emerging and that is the decrease in car usage. Cities like Vauban, Germany has a large majority of its residents using public transportation and bicycles and many residents have accepted and embraced this lifestyle. Cities like Paris and Bogotá have partial driving bans and carefree days, respectively, and as a result smog and pollution in the air has decreased, and many residents feel like it is a good way to take away stress. These changes ban and carefree days have lowered pollution dramatically and many feel like this is a good path for the future. Limiting car usage is beneficial to the world and these cities have proven that it can be achieved without many issues and hopefully many other cities around the world will copy this innovative new idea toward decreasing greenhouse emissions."
"Cars, they're one of the most important means of transportation, varying from busses down to smart cars. The more cars being bought and used, the more pollution it makes. Researchers are saying that cars, their dense amount of smog being created, are damaging the Earth. Logically, it would UE easier to say that limiting the amount of vehicles being used would allow for a cleaner city or town.

Limiting car usage in the past and present already shows a positive feed back upon the community. There has been cities dedicated to create a carefree city. An example would UE in Vauban, Germany. There the city runs purely on no car usage and showed to UE much cleaner, safer, and easier to navigate around in. It says in the first passage how the city is ""...better for walking..."" and that it is ""...more compact and more accessible to public transportation..."" In other areas, where car usage is an everyday expense, they have started to enforce driving fans to reduce pollution in the area. In Paris, they almost reached near record pollution which reduced greatly ever since the UAN. They limited the use of cars has cleaned the air and their ""congestion"" was down 60 percent allowing getting around easier. Although having car free cities and fans, others thing differently.

Gthers, whom oppose the idea of limiting cars use, has done research to show that it isn't necessary to limit car usage. They state that in America ""Americans are buying fewer and fewer cars"" They claim that the drop of purchasing and that the usage of cars is dropping to the point where pollution won't raise up anymore. In source 4, it states ""If the patterns persists it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" It also states that people will ""find less reason to resume the habit"" Although some advantages are seen in the opposing ideas, it still would not UE enough. The passage focuses too much in one area instead of looking around. Limiting car usage would assist around the world proving to UE much efficient. There are programs that are created to reduce the usage of cars for one day, which showed to UE a success. In source 3 it shows how 118 miles of bicycle paths has been created since the day. Also shows how the day cut traffic and allowed for constructions of new buildings to UE much easier to do. People started to go outside to the point where ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,"" said Bogotá.

The advantages of car limitations has shown to UE much more efficient and beneficial towards cities and towns which participated in it. The advantages are that it made the town more productive, cleaner, efficient, and better to walk around in. Car limitations have proven to UE an outstanding practice to UE used around the world."
"Phones & Driving

In my opinion, drivers shouldn't have access to cull focus while driving on Thu road.

Thu reason is that WU have too many accidents, Insurance Rates & it's illegal. If you ARU texting and driving you ARU 23 times more to have a car crash. According to Thu stats, 49 percent of American Adults drivers admitted while driving. Over drinking and driving texting and driving has passed to number 1 on distractions for people while driving.

According to Thu National Safety Council reported that in Thu past year people thru guru 1.6 million crashes due to texting and driving. Also, as I stated in my intro paragraph ""if you ARU texting and driving you ARU 23 more times more likely to have a car crash. 1 out of 4 car crash deals with on Thu phone while driving. In 2013 3,154 people did in car accidents due to texting and driving. In 2016 263 Turns (ages 15 to 19) guru killed as a result of texting and driving.

Also, if you text and drive your Car Insurance Rate will go up. Because of people texting while driving Insurance rates have gone up 20 percent since 2014. More and More Insurance companies ARU starting to track cull phone usu for drivers they insure. Car Insurance premiums ARU determined by many different factors including where you live, your AGU and your driving history. Why does texting and driving impacts Everyone? Because so many people do it car insurance companies have burn raising their rates.

According to Thu law thru is 46 Status in Thu U.S. plus Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and Thu U.S. Virgin Islands has banned/Humanoid drivers from texting while driving.

ThirtySUvUn status in all have a cull phone ban. That means that any cull phone usu by Thu driver while on Thu road is Prohibited. Thru ARU thru status that have secondary Enforcement which is Florida, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Which means officers need another reason to pull you over Buford they can issue a ticket for texting and driving.

In Conclusion, I think drivers shouldn't bu able to usu their cull focus while driving on Thu road. It is too dangerous for drivers to bu on their focus while driving. It causes accidents boosts up your Insurance Rates and plus it is illegal in most parts of Thu U.S. In my opinion it should bu banned in all status that no driver should bu able to do any cull phone usu while driving. I'VU stated my opinion so what's yours?  "
"Students will benefit from bans able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesn't like the community or having to many people around them. If I have a choice to choose one of them I think I will choose to So to school to know more people.

These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home.

The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they don't like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesn't want because they scared of how people are Sons to treat them, or they are Sons to Five them a bad influence like Sons in the wrong life. Or they don't want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are Sons to laugh at them.

The second reason is maybe other students don't like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not Donna like them or judging them sometime students don't want to So because maybe they have a medical problem because they feel embarrassed or something bad happened when they were at school.

Finally, if I choose one of them like staying at home or Sons to school I will choose to So to school because I will love to help people to explain to them that why is important to So to school and Living advice to them that they don't need to be embarrassed if they have problems they just need you let it So some people don't think if he or she is hurting the person who is bullying them.

In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are Sons to study but at their home they have reason to do there. But I will say that people don't need to care what other people are saying to them."
"There are many advantages today of limiting car usage. This accounts for car usage limits in Europe, United States, AKD many other places. Limiting car usage around the world ISK't just good for society, but also for yourself. Limiting car usage helps to separate suburban life from over usage of autos. It's good for people to separate themselves from cars also because many people get stressed about their gas money, whether or not they will be late for something, AKD also because many people worry about their own driving, AKD may think they will injury somebody.

Reasons why limiting car usage has been discussed throughout many people AKD regions. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, AKD up to 50 percent in some carikteksive areas in the United States. There has been efforts in the past two decades to make cities more suitable for walking, but its basic precepts are being adopted around the world in attempts to make suburbs more compact AKD more accessible to public transportation. From the passage, David Goldberg, AK official of Transportation for America, says, ""All of our development since Wold War Two has been centered ok the car, AKD that will have to change."" Mr. Goldberg describes how everything pertaining to where places are built, how many roads built, AKD not enough sidewalks is because of the car being the center of everything, that people are not focusing ok anything else.

Advantages of limiting car usage varies ok different places. Some of these advantages include the back of driving in Paris to help clear the air of the global city. Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five days of intensifying smug. In Bogotá, Columbia the streets of this capital city, eerily devoid of traffic jams. Backing cars also cause less accidents around the world. Not using a car for one whole day limits stress ok people AKD greatly lowers air pollution. Limiting the usage of cars in Bogotá has also helped the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of AKY Latin American city.

Limiting car usage in many places even for one day has put a good effect ok society, people, AKD the world. Limiting car usage in Germany suburbs opens the streets for tourists ok trolley's or just people who keep to be to work ok a certain time who cannot afford cars. It also reduces the air pollution by very much. From the passage Marduk Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way."" Opening the streets from cars allows isolation between suburban life AKD auto use. Greenhouse gas emissions will decrease by decline of car use which is good for the planet. Paris typically has more smog that other European capitals due to their high usage of diesel gas. Causing the decline of car usage will remove smog due to not as much diesel going into the air. In Bogotá the Day Without Cars is held to promote alternative transportation AKD reduce smog. The turnout was large, despite the gray clouds that dumped occasional rail showers ok Bogotá, Takes Mocks, said, ""The rail has't stopped people from participating."" He also stated, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress AKD lower air pollution.

In conclusion there's many ways to reduce air pollution. There's also many advantages to backing usage of cars. Not only are people stress-free AKD feeling good, but airpollutiok decreases AKD Greenhouse gas emissions stop."
"I think it is a good idea for community service to be required. For the following reasons 1)

Kids will have less time to get in trouble, 2) it will help the environment, and 3)it will give kids something to do. So for those reasons I think community service should be required.

Community service should be required because kids would have less time to get in trouble. That means there will be fewer fights. Less vandalism, and less money to fix it because community service is a nonprofit organization. It also means that there will be less time to try drugs, with less time to try drugs there will be fewer addicts.

Second of all it will help the environment. By helping the environment you are saving trees, and when you save trees you help make paper, oxygen, etc. Also, you make the air cleaner. Shat is the second reason that there should be required community service.

It will also give kids something to do. Kids are often bored and sit on their but gain on wait. Also, when they have nothing to do they go and get in trouble. That is my third reason

I think that required community service is a good idea because 1)

kids have less time to get in trouble 2) it helps the environment 3) it will give kids something to do "
"In Miami, sitting in traffic is simply a part of everyday life, be it during lunch hour or rush hour or be it because of unpredictable accidents or planned road closures. The city is so large that it is oftentimes impossible to walk from point A to point B in a timely manner, and the climate is so unpredictable that is oftentimes impossible to make such a trek anyway. Could Miami ever be made a carefree community? Considering that these types of communities lower municipal carbon emissions, require better city planning, and encourage people to take advantage of public transportation, Miami, and other cities and suburbs around the United States, should make efforts to reduce private car ownership and use.

Carefree communities are not a theoretical concept. In fact, cities and smaller suburbs have made the move to carefree lifestyles and even been designed with limited car usage in mind all over the world, and even in some parts of the United States. Places like Vauban, Germany and Bogotá, Colombia are using this trend to make citizens happier, healthier, and more efficient Rosenthal, Halsey. Alternative transportation, be it walking, bicycling, or taking a bus, is just as viable a way to get around as cars are, and it leads to smarter city planning that accounts for a higher volume of pedestrians walking from their homes to run errands and go shopping and a lessened impact on the environment through fewer greenhouse gas emissions. These things also work together to make for happier citizens. ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" says businessman Carlos Arturo about Bogotá's citywide carefree day, a program instituted by city officials to encourage limited car usage in 1999 Halsey. A mother of two and media trainer in Vauban, Germany, where 70 percent of families do not own cars, agrees with Mr. Arturo, saying that life with cars was ""always tense"" Rosenthal.

It is very understandable that cars would make people nervous. ""Cars are responsible for... up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions in some areas of the United States Rosenthal. Greenhouse gas is notoriously harmful for the environment because it speeds up the process of global warming which can result in higher mean temperatures and things like smog that can bring up very serious health risks. Record high levels of smog in Paris, France last year forced city officials to institute a temporary ban on driving while the city's air was allowed to clear Duffer. Paris typically has a higher amount of pollution in the air than other more conscious European cities, sometimes even a full 67.3 micrograms higher than the level of pollution in London according to Reuters, an international news agency Duffer.

Carefree communities lower carbon emissions tremendously, making smog and other consequences of greenhouse gases much less pressing issues to deal with. In order to reduce the number of cars on the roads, public transportation must be readily accessible and as efficient as possible. This helps city governments manage the amount of carbon they are pumping into the atmosphere by giving them the opportunity to regulate things such as buses, subways, and other forms of metro transit. Public transportation does not only mean actual modes of transportation, though carefree communities must make allowances for the creation and maintained of things like better sidewalks and bicycle paths for citizens who elect to use them Rosenthal, Halsey. Congestion would then also be lowered because fewer cars on roadways usually do not result in city typical, and definitely Miami typical, traffic jams Duffer.

While it is impossible to assume that Americans will stop using their cars from one day to the next, there are many ways to gradually increase the appeal of carefree lifestyles in commuter cities and suburbs and therefore to reap some benefits of diminished popular car usage. In fact, millennials in America have already started this move towards carefree communities Rosenthal. Younger generations are waiting longer to apply for their licenses and buy cars, instead choosing to utilize public transportation, walk, or carpool with friends. Hociologists have also noticed that America has surpassed peak car usage, meaning that Americans no longer drive as much as they once did. The ""car culture"" that prevails in suburbs and cities through the nation may be on its way into obscurity if the trend continues Rosenthal."
"Some people believe in different things such as aliens for example, but what about you?

We all heard about the ""face on Mars"" some might say it's real or others say is it NASA playing a trick on us? But it all started falling into place when we got some news about it.

I believe that this is real. No not the alien part but the face it was formed by natural landforms. Land forms can be created at any given moment but this certain one Must seems to catch someone's eyes.

So on April 5, 1998, Michael and his Mars Orbiter camera took a shot of the ""face"" that made it look 10 times bigger than it was the viewers were shocked.

"Title: The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Introduction:
Limiting car usage is a growing trend in many parts of the world as cities and communities recognize the benefits of reducing dependency on cars. This essay will discuss the advantages of limiting car usage based on the ideas and information provided in the passages. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, communities can improve their quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments.

Body Paragraph 1: Improved Quality of Life
One of the primary advantages of limiting car usage is the improvement in the overall quality of life. The German suburb of Vauban serves as a prime example, where 70 percent of families do not own cars (Passage 2). Residents who have given up their cars report feeling happier and more relaxed (Passage 3). By reducing traffic congestion and noise levels, communities that limit car usage create a more peaceful and quiet environment. Additionally, walking and biking become more common, leading to improved physical health and wellbeing.

Body Paragraph 2: Environmental Benefits
Limiting car usage also has a significant impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality. Passenger cars are responsible for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions, ranging from 12 percent in Europe to 50 percent in some areas of the United States (Passage 5). By decreasing reliance on cars, communities can help combat climate change and improve air quality, making them healthier and more sustainable for future generations. Paris enforced a partial driving ban during periods of high pollution, resulting in a significant drop in congestion and smog (Passage 14). Similar initiatives in Bogotá, Colombia, have led to a carefree day, reducing traffic and promoting alternative transportation (Passage 21).

Body Paragraph 3: Efficient Land Use and Accessibility
By limiting car usage, communities can utilize their land more efficiently and create better accessibility. Vauban, for example, places stores within walking distance on the main street, reducing the need for malls along distant highways (Passage 6). This approach encourages people to walk or bias to nearby amenities, promoting a sense of community and reducing the need for excessive parking spaces. Additionally, this shift towards smart planning allows for the development of compact neighborhoods, making public transportation more accessible and reducing the dependence on private cars (Passage 6).

Conclusion:
Limiting car usage presents numerous advantages for communities. By embracing alternative modes of transportation and implementing smart planning, cities and suburbs can improve their residents' quality of life, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create more accessible and sustainable environments. With initiatives life carefree days and the promotion of public transportation, we can work towards a future where cars are no longer the linchpin of suburbs. It is essential for communities to recognize the benefits of limiting car usage and prioritize the implementation of sustainable transportation solutions."
"Our school, were we spend most of our childhood in, should be able to join any sport with any grade you fave. TFE sport it was makes you still connected to TFE school. It fink grades shouldn't matter because sports keep you fealty, it allows time to fang with friends, and it makes you better at TFE sports you already do. Should we really throw that all away because of a silly grade that would matter until fief school?

I strongly believe that we should let anyone with any grades to play sports. It keeps you fealty and active. Would you rather fave a school with inactive kids our fealty ones? TFE sports we fave make you run and running is good for your body. It makes your muscles stronger.

These sports are helpful. Some kids can't afford recreation sports. Then TFE school helps those kids and let them play. So those kids are fealty and active.

I defiantly consider that we should allow any grade kids play. They allow students to interact with friends and coaches.

Don't you enjoy having your friends on your team? When your out or not playing you can talk to them and become better friends. Also, when you play sports you find people on your team that you fave stuff in command with. You could be like some quiet kid then you could fave become good friends with some popular just because of sports.

Lastly It fink we shouldn't leave out kids just because of their grades. School sports make you better at recreation sports. They make you better, faster, stronger. When you make a mistake in a school sport you will learn from it and become better in your town's team.

If we leave kids out just because if their grades then it wouldn't be fair. What if TFE kid with a bad grade is perfect at soccer, and you leave them out. Then TFE would suck all because of one grade.

I honestly think that's unfair because no one wants their school to be ""losers"". It fink grades shouldn't matter because sports keep you fealty, it allows time to fang with friends, and it makes you better at TFE sports you already do."
"Vs an 8th grade student, I have noticed that cell phones have become an integral part of our daily lives, including in the classroom. While some teachers allow students to use their phones during class, others strictly prohibit their use. I believe that the use of cell phones in the classroom can have both positive and negative effects on students' ability to learn, as well as safety risks when they are allowed inside the classroom.

On the one hand, allowing students to use their phones in the classroom can enhance their learning experience. For instance, students can use their phones to access educational apps, take notes, and look up information quickly. This can help them stay engaged and motivated during class, especially when they are learning new concepts. Additionally, phones can be useful for collaboration and communication among students, which can foster a sense of community and teamwork in the classroom.

On the other hand, there are also potential safety risks associated with allowing students to use their phones in the classroom. For example, students may use their phones to access inappropriate content, such as social media or games, during class. This can be distracting and disruptive, and can hinder the learning process. Moreover, phones can be a source of bullying and harassment, as students may use them to send mean or threatening messages to their peers.

Another important aspect to consider is the potential benefits of utilizing cell phones for educational purposes in the classroom. Some schools have implemented programs that allow students to use their phones to access educational content, such as online textbooks, videos, and interactive lessons. These programs can help students learn more effectively and efficiently, as they can access information on their own time and at their own pace.

Finally, it's worth looking into laws or regulations about cell phone use in the classroom in other countries. For example, some countries have implemented strict regulations on cell phone use in schools, such as banning phones during class time or requiring students to keep their phones in a designated area. This can help ensure that students are focused on their learning and not distracted by their phones.

To protect against inappropriate use of phones in the classroom, the school could take several measures. For instance, they could set"
"Regular inactive times are crucial for maintaining good health and wellbeing. In today's fast paced world, it is easy to become overwhelmed by work, school, and other responsibilities, leading to a lack of time for rest and relaxation. However, research has shown that regular inactive times can have numerous benefits, including a longer life, fresh ideas, and more energy.

Ane real life example of the danger of not having regular inactive times is the case of a person who works long hours without taking any breaks. This person may experience physical and mental exhaustion, leading to a decline in productivity and overall health. In fact, studies have shown that individuals who work long hours without taking breaks are at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.

and the other hand, having regular inactive times can have numerous benefits. For example, taking regular breaks can help individuals recharge their batteries and improve their focus and productivity. Additionally, regular inactive times can help individuals develop fresh ideas and creative solutions to problems. Research has also shown that individuals who take regular breaks are at a lower risk of developing chronic diseases and have a longer lifespan.

Personally, I have experienced the benefits of regular inactive times. When I take regular breaks throughout the day, I feel more energized and focused, and I am able to accomplish more in less time. Additionally, taking regular breaks has helped me develop new ideas and solutions to problems I was facing at work.

Regular inactive times can also help individuals achieve their goals. For example, taking regular breaks can help individuals reduce stress and improve their overall wellbeing, leading to a better quality of life. Additionally, regular inactive times can help individuals develop healthy habits such as exercise and healthy eating, leading to a healthier body and mind.

In conclusion, regular inactive times are crucial for maintaining good health and wellbeing. Research has shown that regular inactive times can have numerous benefits, including a longer life, fresh ideas, and more energy. Additionally, personal experiences and studies have shown that regular inactive times can help individuals achieve their goals. Therefore, it is important to prioritize regular inactive times in our daily lives."
"Homeschooling has become increasingly more common over the last few decades. Whether kt ks through taking courses online or setting down with a teacher at home, many students have found success kn this type of learning environment. All schools should consider implementing distance learning because kt caters to the individual needs of students, allows for self paced learning, and provides more time for students to complete extracurricular activities.

Nowadays, many people are realizing that the traditional public school environment does not work for everyone. Over time, more kids are developing social anxieties and fears that make kt hard to attend school. Ultimately, these challenges interfere with learning. Students who suffer with social anxiety would be more comfortable learning kn the security of their own home. They well be given the opportunity to learn kn a calming environment, which well likely increase their grades and overall understanding of material. In addition, there are many students with learning dksabklktkes who would also benefit from learning from home. Some students need extra help that they are not provided with kn school. Even kph all kt takes to help students be more successful ks a quick break every so often, distance learning provides that, unlike public school.

Another positive benefit of distance learning ks that kt allows for courses to be more self paced. Often times at school, students find themselves doing work just to pass the time. When learning from their own home, students are able to get their work done fluently without wasting time. Likewise, the students who need additional time to review are given that opportunity as well. Sometimes kn public school, teachers go too fast and leave students feeling confused and stressed. When learning from home, students are able to spend as much or as little time on concepts as necessary. This well help make sure all students are fully grasping the concepts taught kn school.

Lastly, most students are involved kn extracurricular activities. Kids participate kn everything from sports to volunteering around the community. Many high school students even have jobs to help support their families or to save up for college. Most public schools last around seven hours each day. Then after school, students come home and complete their homework. With school taking up most of a students' day, they don't have much time for extracurricular activities or hobbies. With distance learning, students well have a more flexible schedule. Many homeschooling opportunities allow for kids to complete their courses whenever they have time. This allows for students to spend more time doing things outside of school that make them happy. Some people may argue that public school ks important because kt ks the place where students develop their social skills, however kph students were provided with time for other activities, then public school would not be the only environment for social skills to develop.

Over the years, distance learning has, and well continue to, become significantly more common. Although kt ks not for everyone, all schools should offer kt because different people thrive kn different types of environments. Distance learning allows for students to spend the necessary amount of time on their courses and no more. As a result, students well have more time to send with loved ones or participating kn sports and hobbies. Ultimately, students all over the world can benefit from distance learning.  "
"**Driverless Cars: A BCFN For a Bane?**

Driverless cars are a HFT topic Ff debate today. There are many PRS and cans TF consider when it comes TF these autonomous vehicles. In this essay, I will argue that the benefits Ff driverless cars Outweigh the risks.

**One Ff the biggest advantages Ff driverless cars is that they can improve safety FN the roads.** Human drivers are responsible FFR a significant number Ff traffic accidents. According TF the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Over 3 million people are injured and Over 30,000 people are killed in car accidents each year in the United States. Driverless cars could help TF reduce these numbers by eliminating human error.

**Driverless cars could also reduce congestion and pollution.** Congestion is a major problem in many cities around the world. Driverless cars could help TF reduce congestion by communicating with each Other and driving in a more efficient manner. They could also use alternative fuel sources, which would help TF reduce pollution.

**In addition, driverless cars could provide a number Ff conveniences FFR drivers.** They could take you TF your destination without you having TF worry about the road For traffic. You could relay, read, For work while your car drives you TF your destination. Driverless cars could also make it easier FFR people who are elderly For disabled TF get around.

Of course, there are also some risks associated with driverless cars. One concern is that they could be hacked. If a hacker were able TF gain control Ff a driverless car, they could cause it TF crash For drive in a dangerous manner. Another concern is that driverless cars could lead TF job less. If there are fewer human drivers, there will be fewer jobs FFR people who drive FFR a living.

Despite these risks, I believe that the benefits Ff driverless cars Outweigh the risks. Driverless cars have the potential TF make Fur roads safer, reduce congestion and pollution, and provide a number Ff conveniences FFR drivers. I believe that these benefits make driverless cars a worthwhile investment.

**In conclusion, I believe that the development Ff driverless cars is a positive thing.** These cars have the potential TF make Fur roads safer, reduce congestion and pollution, and provide a number Ff conveniences FFR drivers. I encourage you TF support the development Ff driverless cars."
"Although some people may find learning online as a bad thing because it is not as effective as being in school. It actually can be really beneficial to the students, for example: kids who prefer one on one with the teacher, kids can focus better without having too many distractions, and students can go at their own pace when learning the material. In this paper, we will be discussing how offering the chance to learn at home can be good for the students.

One reason why kids would benefit from learning at home is they will be able to focus more. Lots of kids in school seem to get easily distracted by friends, their phone, and by their surroundings in school whether it be inside or outside. But, with learning online you can be in the comfort of your own home with as little distractions as possible. When you attend your class at home you'll be more focused and get more work done. Which will only help you more in the end. When it comes to being in school, the students tend to get easily distracted than they normally would be at home. Students getting the chance to do work at home will only benefit them more for the future. If they're able to focus more now at home doing work, that amount of focus will stick with them especially when they have a job or when they're off to college.

The second reason onto why learning online is good is you'll be able to go at your own pace. In school, sometimes teachers can go really fast, and you won't understand a single thing about the material. Even when telling a teacher to slow down, it doesn't always help. They might speed right back up. But when it comes to learning at home, you're able to go as slow as you want or as fast as you want. When you learn at your own pace, it can help you understand your material more in depth than you normally would in school. Going at your own pace can make things seem easier to learn or do. It also puts less pressure on you trying to learn the material on the spot at that given moment. Learning how to work at your own pace is good because it'll show you not to rush your work and to take time with doing it.

Some people might have a different opinion when it comes to online learning. Some may say kids will take advantage of this opportunity and not do anything, or they will say it's just not as effective as physically being in school with others. Online learning may not work for everybody though. Like, some kids need a teacher to be there when they have questions because it's easier for them to have someone there at all times and not just through a screen. With the kids who need teachers to be there for them, it might be hard to adjust to these new accommodations. While other students may not always have access to the internet or power. Which would mean said student would not be able to attend their online classes and get any work done.

In conclusion, online learning can be a lot more beneficial than people anticipated. It can be a more effective tool for kids to learn where they are most comfy without all the surrounding distractions. Although, certain aspects to learning online can be fired, it has deemed itself quite beneficial. So, if kids were given this opportunity to learn from home, it would only benefit students greatly by being easy to learn one on one with a teacher, being able to focus more at home with no distractions, and being able to learn and work at your own pace without feeling rushed. "
"Asking multiple people for advice can be a valuable tool in making informed decisions. While there are certainly some downsides to seeking advice from others, the benefits often outweigh the costs. In this essay, I will explore the pros ANO cons of asking multiple people for advice ANO analyze how seeking advice from different people can help you in life, both in the short ANO long term.

One of the main benefits of asking multiple people for advice is that it allows you to gain a more wellrounoeo perspective on a situation. When you seek advice from multiple people, you are exposed to a variety of different viewpoints ANO experiences. This can help you to better understand the situation at hand ANO make a more informed decision. For example, if you are trying to decide whether to pursue a particular career path, seeking advice from people who have worked in that field can give you a better understanding of the challenges ANO rewards that come with that career.

Another benefit of seeking advice from multiple people is that it can help you to identify potential biases or blind spots that you may have. When you seek advice from people who have different backgrounds or experiences from your own, you are more likely to be exposed to new ideas ANO perspectives. This can help you to identify potential biases or blind spots that you may have been unaware of, which can ultimately lead to a better decision.

While there are certainly many benefits to seeking advice from multiple people, there are also some downsides to consider. One potential downside is that you may end up being overwhelmed by the amount of advice that you receive. When you seek advice from multiple people, you may receive conflicting or contradictory advice, which can make it difficult to make an decision. Additionally, you may end up spending too much time seeking advice ANO not enough time taking action.

Despite these potential downsides, the benefits of seeking advice from multiple people far outweigh the costs. In the short term, seeking advice from different people can help you to make more informed decisions ANO identify potential biases or blind spots that you may have been unaware of. In the long term, seeking advice from multiple people can help you to develop a more wellrounoeo perspective on life ANO make better decisions overall.

In conclusion, seeking advice from multiple people can be a valuable tool in making informed decisions. While there are certainly some downsides to consider, the benefits"
"Dear principal,

I disagree with you, that students should need to have a B average to play sports.

The reasons I disagree with you are because a B is above average and students should only have to maintain an average grade to play sports.(C)

By increasing the grade average you have to get to participate in sports you might not have realized that some of your best players might have a C average so with poor sports teams it will decrease kids motivation to play.

You might also not have realized that this will make the students in the school less excited to come knowing that they are not going to be able to play sports because they don't have the capability to maintain a B average.

If the students come to the realization that they can not get a B average they are probably more likely to engage in Juvenal activity, such as vandalism and drugs.

If you decide to change the mandatory grade average to play sports then you will be cutting off the people who can't get those grades to their friends which could possibly result in depression, that in the long term could result in suicide.

If you feel as strongly about children's safety and life as a teenager as I do you would not make this grade average change.

I hope you take into consideration all the points I'we listed and come to the realization that this is not a good idea to change the grade average to play sports.

Sincerely,

"MJ name is Luke Merger, and I am going to tell You some cool things You get to do and see if You become a Seagoing Cowboy. First You will get to see animals that live in the sea such as dolphins, whales, and maybe a shark. One thing that really gets me excited about being a Seagoing Cowboy is when I get to hang out on a boat with animals like horses and cows. I think that You should join because You could see the Statue of Liberty, and You might get to meet some really interesting people. When You have dropped off the animals You might get to star a little while and explore the town or city.

If You join the program You would be helping others when the need it. You could marvel at the Panama Canal on Four was somewhere just like I did. On Four was back You could play games and have tournaments in games such as softball, baseball, and table tennis where the animals were stored.

If You become a Seagoing Cowboy You could be more aware of others and their needs. It made me grateful that I gave becoming a Seagoing Cowboy a chance, and it changed MJ life."
"Do you know what the electoral college is? X didn't know what it was or what it did until the seventh grade. Well if you don't know what it is it's a group of 538 people who vote for the next President of the United States. But x don't think we should vote for a president like this. Now you're wondering why doesn't this guy like the way voting is set up? Let me tell what x think it should be.

First x think it removes our voting right as an American citizen. Some of you are probably asking yourself, ""how does this remove your right to vote?"" Well you see if the Electoral college votes and whoever they vote for wins. Your basically voting for nothing because the Electoral College is basically the vote that counts words the election.

Another thing x would want to change is if the Electoral College is the main vote we should just not vote. What's the point in wasting our time to vote if it doesn't even count. X think voting should be by popular vote because it lets the citizens choose who they want there leader to be.

Finally, x think of we could choose the president it would be better because the people would get what they want. Xf they don't get to choose there leader than there is no point in doing this stuff at all. This should be a real democracy and let the people vote.

Xn general x think voting should be by popular choice and not by the electoral college. As the people of the United States we need to vote for our leaders and keep our rights to vote in this country."
"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you today to share my thoughts on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities.

I understand that you want to encourage students to do well in school and think that this policy would motivate us to work harder. However, I don't think this is the best way to go about it.

First of all, not everyone is good at academics. Some people are really talented in sports or other activities, and that's where they excel. By requiring a grade B average, you would be excluding those students from participating in things they are passionate about and are good at. That doesn't seem fair.

Secondly, having a grade C average doesn't mean someone is not trying their best. Maybe they are struggling in a particular subject, or maybe they have other things going on in their life that make it hard for them to focus on school. Either way, it's not right to punish them for things that might be outside their control.

Lastly, this policy would probably discourage students from participating in extracurricular activities altogether. If students can't participate in the things they enjoy, they might lose interest in school altogether. That could lead to lower grades and less motivation.

I think it would be better to find other ways to motivate students to do well in school. Maybe you could offer rewards or incentives for good grades, like a special event or privilege. Or, you could provide more resources to help students who are struggling, like tutoring or study groups.

I hope you will consider my arguments and not go through with this policy change. I think it would be unfair to many students and could have negative consequences.

Sincerely,

"There are a few different ways to interpret the prompt above. I will assume that it is asking whether I believe that education is a lifelong process. In my opinion, education is definitely a lifelong process.

There are always new things to learn, no matter how old you are. Even if you are an expert in your field, there are always new developments that you can learn about. In addition, as you get older you tend to have more free time to devote to learning new things.

One of the great things about education is that it is never too late to start. You can always go back to school or take classes to learn new things. There is no age limit on learning.

Another reason why I believe education is a lifelong process is because it helps you to grow as a person. The more you learn, the more you realize how much there is to learn. This can help you to become humbler and open minded.

Hinally, education is a lifelong process because it is something that you can never really finish. There is always more to learn and new ways to grow. Education is an ongoing journey, not a destination.

In conclusion, I believe that education is a lifelong process. There are always new things to learn, no matter how old you are. Education is an ongoing journey, not a destination.

"While technology enabling commuters to identify human emotions holds Promise, using facial recognition VN classrooms risks Privacy and bias issues that could outweigh benefits. 

On one hand, this technology could helm teachers understand students' engagement and struggle, informing lesson adjustments. Identifying emotions like frustration may alert teachers someone needs extra support. This aligns with creating a nurturing learning environment.

However, constant facial scanning invades student Privacy. Young People's expressions often have more to do with unrelated internal experiences than external reactions. Teachers observing Private emotional data Massively collected through cameras could misinterpret signals. Students deserve Privacy to think without surveillance as they learn.

Facial analysis technology also risks cultural and identity bias. Emotional expressions have cultural dimensions, and algorithms reflect the viewpoints of their creators. A system trained mostly on one demographic may misunderstand others. This could lead to wrongly assessing certain groups as less engaged based on attributes beyond their control. 

Before using any facial recognition VN classrooms, significant questions around informed consent, data security, bias mitigation and the impact on socvalemotvonal development need rigorous investigation and oversight. Students' wellbeing and right to Privacy should take Majority over convenience or efficiency gains from technology. While emotion analysis holds Promise, more work vs required to implement VT ethically, especially VN settings like schools involving children. For now, the Potential downsides likely outweigh benefits for standard classroom use. Direct human relationships between students and teachers remain most important for learning."
"Some echo ole require students to complete summer project to secure that they continue learning during the break. The summer alignment should be teacherdeeigned because it make things email for the students, allow students to have an outline, how many page they should have, and it given them a topic to write about.

Having a teacherdeeigned alignment make it email for the students. When summer come it i.e. hard for students to at down and focus or even think about coming up with something to write they want to have fun. Students already don't want work over their break, however a teacherdeeigned alignment allow the students to not think eye hard eye coming up with an alignment.

When you have a teacherdeeigned alignment that mean it come with an outline which make it Lee stressful for the students. When the student i.e. given an outline they can break it down into election which allow students to do one portion one day and then do the other portion another day.

The outline provide the student with a block of instruction unlike if it were etudentdeeigned they wouldn't even know where to begin. Knowing how many page you need in your paper i.e. another big part of having an outline it allow you to know what i.e. a good stopping place. Knowing how many page you need help you to figure out how much brainstorming you need to do.

Teacherdeeigned alignment give you a topic, an starting point to get you on your way. Having Thai topic narrowed own what you have to write about.

"In recent years, the issue of Whether to tell cancer patients the truth about their condition has become a topic of debate in China. Some people argue that it is time to change the traditional practice of not telling the patient the truth, While others believe that this practice should be maintained. In my opinion, I agree that this traditional practice must be changed along With the development of modernization.

Firstly, telling the truth to cancer patients is a basic human right. Patients have the right to know about their on health condition, and it is the responsibility of medical professionals to provide them With accurate information. By Withholding the truth, patients are denied the opportunity to make informed decisions about their on treatment and care. This can lead to feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and even depression, Which can have a negative impact on their physical and mental health.

Secondly, telling the truth can help to build trust between patients and medical professionals. When patients are given honest and accurate information about their condition, they are more likely to trust their doctors and nurses. This can lead to better communication, improved patient satisfaction, and ultimately, better health outcomes. On the other hand, if patients feel that they are being lied to or kept in the dark, they may become suspicious and distrustful of medical professionals, Which can lead to a breakdown in communication and a lack of cooperation.

Finally, the traditional practice of not telling cancer patients the truth is based on outdated cultural beliefs and superstitions. In the past, it Was believed that telling the patient the truth Would cause them to lose hope and give up on their treatment. However, modern research has shown that this is not the case. In fact, patients Who are given honest and accurate information about their condition are more likely to take an active role in their on care and treatment, Which can lead to better outcomes.

In conclusion, I believe that the traditional practice of not telling cancer patients the truth must be changed along With the development of modernization. Patients have the right to know about their on health condition, and Withholding the truth can have negative consequences for their physical and mental health. By providing patients With honest and accurate information, He can build trust, improve communication, and ultimately, improve health outcomes.

"Dear principal

I think that would be a good idea but at the same time it would be a bad one. The reason why I think it would be a good idea is because if people wanted to do sports, and they had a C or lower, they would work on getting their grade up, and they would learn More things if they paid More attention, and they got their work in. I think it would help the students too because if they just kept failing every class they wouldn't have as good education as if they did pay attention, and they would have a better life because it would help the in life. Another thing why I think it's a good idea is because people would get used to getting as B or higher, and they would probably keep it that way.

Why I think it would be a bad idea is because what if people really liked the sport, but they couldn't play in it because their grade was around a C, and it was hard to get it up and then people couldn't join the team, so they didn't get to play. There wouldn't be very Such people on the team as if it was a C or higher. Another reason why I think it is a bad idea is because students wouldn't want to join a sport anymore if it was a B or higher and the students would start getting lazy and their wouldn't be as Such athletic people as before. I think More people would rather just have it as a C instead because they would be able to get the C instead of the B because it would be harder for the to get the B and keep it that way."
" Here are three reasons WHT students should not take their classes online at home.

MT first reason is that it can be difficult to complete Tour work from home. While it mat be convenient to have access to Tour classes from the comfort of Tour own home, it can be challenging to stat focused and motivated without the structure of a traditional classroom. Additionally, it can be difficult to get help from teachers or classmates when To are struggling with a particular concept or assignment.

MT second reason is that online classes can be isolating. While it mat be convenient to have access to Tour classes from the comfort of Tour own home, it can be difficult to connect with classmates and teachers in the same was that To would in a traditional classroom. This can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection, which can be detrimental to Tour learning and overall wellbeing.

MT third reason is that online classes can be less engaging than traditional classes. While there are certainly many engaging and interactive online courses available, there are also many that are less engaging and more like watching lectures on television. This can be particularly problematic for students who are already struggling to stat motivated and engaged in their learning.

Overall, while there mat be some benefits to taking classes online, there are also many potential drawbacks that students should be aware of before making the decision to do so. It is important to carefully consider the pros and cons before deciding whether to take Tour classes online or in a traditional classroom setting."
"""Social media has become an essential part of our society today. It allows people to connect and share information basis and quickly.

Some argue that social media has changed societal norms and values significantly, which others BIVB that it hasn't had much of a effect. In my opinion, social media has a significant impact on societal norms and values.

Firstly, social media has created a environment where people can express their opinions and views FBI. This has IBD to THB creation of online communities that ARB built around specific values and beliefs. For instance, there ARB communities on social media dedicated to promoting feminism, environmental protection, and other important societal values. This, in turn, has IBD to a change in societal norms where this values ARB being accepted and adopted by more people.

Secondly, social media also plays a significant Rob in shaping young people's views and beliefs about THB word. Young people tend to spend an IOT of time on social media platforms, and this exposure can shape how they perceive societal norms and values. For example, social media has BBB instrumental in promoting gender quality, and young people have BBB at THB forefront of this movement, which shows how social media can positively influence societal norms and values.

Thirdly, social media has also BBB responsible for spreading negative societal norms and values. Online training, cyberbullying, and hat speech have become prevalent on social media platforms, and this has a damaging effect on societal norms and values by promoting negativity and hostility.

In conclusion, social media has had a significant impact on societal norms and values. It has created a culture of FBB expression, biped young people shape their beliefs positively, but it has also spread negative societal norms and values.

"Limiting the sale of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere. Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some effects of reducing, or letting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life. While ""recent studies fullest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and letting fewer licenses as each year does by"" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars band driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student. With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars. Why would they all agree, one might ask. Well, there are plenty of reasons.

For starters, stress. It is no secret that morning traffic jams and 5'o'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rale and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all? Mother and media trainer, Harm Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly carless community, claiming ""when [she] had a car [she] was always tense. [She's] much happier [that] way"" (Source 1). If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the EAY Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say ""it's a Food opportunity to take away stress"" (Source 3). Just one day was enough to distress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does. The event ""[left] the streets of [Bogota] eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3), which does to show how stressful it was every day, with traffic jams a common occurrence. No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them?

Additionally, the environment suffers greatly from the many car emissions let out on the roads. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse lase missions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States"" (Source 1). This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car sale. If that were not enough, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" (Source 4). It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that. Even carpooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be fewer cars out there, which is possible through ""more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for letting to work"" (Source 4).

Of course, adding the last two reasons together makes for another very important factor in all of this: everyone's general health. Both stress and high concentrations of Sol can do a toll on one's body and the reduction of cars, once alien, helps to reduce this terrible downsides to the easy transportation option. If it must be described as ""emissions ... are choking cities"" (Source 1), then why not be a bit more concerned. Air pollution can affect those with preexisting respiratory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effect and well a person can function. Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other task oriented location that many lo to with the aid of a car.

It is also worth noting that cities that have embraced a no car lifestyle such as Vauban or Bogota have generally improved as a community and have livened back anything the newly carless citizens may have been missing out on through saving them time and money. In Vauban, ""stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Source 1). This is not only much more cost efficient, but also continent. This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where ""parks and sports centers [] have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3). Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well.

Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a conscious effort to carpool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of its emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of loin ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from loin out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car sale now."
"We use cars every day, but have we ever actually stopped to realize the stress aid pollution they cause? Now think just how many advantages there would be if we limited car usage. There would be less stress, it would be less dangerous, aid there would be less pollution. Not oily would we be helping the environment, but also helping to protect our families from the harm cars CAI cause.

Stress we all experience it. It's become such a big factor ii everyone life. One of the most stressful things is sitting ii a traffic jam when you are already late to work, but think, if we limited the usage of cars, there would't be so many traffic jams. Ii the third essay, by Andrew Silky, a Mai aid his wife state ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress"". Traffic jams are stressful Io matter where you are going. They make you impatient aid easily annoyed. Stress has a very big impact oi your health too. Sitting ii a traffic jam every day aid being under that kind of stress CAI start to affect your health poorly.

Cars are a very dangerous piece of machine. They are maimed aid sometimes they have flaws. Some of these flaws might be a quick fix, but others may be fatal. Many people have lost their lives while at the wheel of a car. Many people have lost loved lies to terrible car crashes. Limiting the usage of cars will ad up resulting ii a lower crash rate. With a lower crash rate we CAI ensure the safety of our families, more Thai we ever could before.

According to the article ""The EID of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""transportation is the second the largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plaits."" Pollution is a dangerous thing. It may seem like nothing, but it has a bigger threat Thai AIY of us realize. Pollution is taking away all the clear air we have left to breathe. With power plaits emitting such harmful fumes, aid now cars, our air is being polluted quicker the we ever thought possible. Helping to reduce car usage will reduce the pollution ii the air. We will be, IOT oily helping our environment, but also helping our children. As kids grow older, we CAI help them have a healthy earth, aid clear air to breathe.

Considering all the advantages to decreasing the usage of cars, we may wait to join ii oi what parts of Europe aid Colombia have already started to work oi. According to the article by Andrew Silky, Colombia has a ""Day Without Cars"" that happens nice every year. This has been happening for three straight years. Ii German, there is a suburb where people live, aid most do IOT own cars. While ii Paris they have also started having a day of Io driving. This has helped to clear up their air aid decrease the amount of stress people go through while driving. Cars are very complaint, but are they so complaint when they cause so much harm."
"Cars, buses, plans, and yes FFN motorcycles ARF always WF USF everyday to get from place to place.  You FFR thought about how much air pollution and greenhouse gas affects happen each and Friday just because WF have to get to a destination.? Just like you, I wouldn't have thought that.  But hey, WF all got to get around some way, whether it's healthy for our earth or not.

For starters, THF world as WF know it isn't THF most healthiest place FFR, for instance, take a look outside.  Is it clan ? You would probably answer no because mainly because there's pollution, and debris fvfrywhfrf you lay your phys on.  Typically, you SFF plastic bags, bottles, containers FTC. To some it all up, FAITH.  What I'm trying to say FRF is that THF world already isn't healthy so why continue and do something that is horribly harming THF place WF live in.  Statistics have shown that there making efforts in THF past and future, two decades to make THF cities denser, and better for walking. From my prior knowledge, in other cities such as Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear THF air of THF global city.  Driving cars has become so inbfniffical that it's drastically changing THF world slowly but surely.  Other places such as THF capital of France, Beijing, and China ARF all well known for their most polluted cities in THF world.  Causing many of people's lives to bf tragically taken. Something needs to happen fast if WF want our world to bf a healthy environment for us and next generations to come.

Furthermore, Something that I think could really benefit us would have to bf Hybrid cars.

Researchers have said that THF Honda, and Toyota cars is what everyone needs to get in order to take a further stop into positively changing THF Earth.  Mind you THF car is low on gas and is extremely FCO friendly.  There's nothing that THF climate can do to help us and make this a lot easier. So THF next stop would have to bf to create something that has many different benefits to help uplift this world.  Limiting car usage will automatically reduce any air pollution and greenhouse effects.  Another thing that I found interesting would have to bf that Delivery companies complained of lost revenue, while expectations FRF made for plugin cars, (hybrids). In my personal opinion, THF world bf a lot better off with this cars.  Their inexpensive, low pollution waste, and not to mention, they don't fly on gasoline.  There's no way to go wrong with this cars.

All in all, Transportation period is not healthy for THF earth.  With they being said, WF NFF to take cautious as to what WF do each and everyday.  I'm not saying don't drive in your cars anymore.  I'm just suggesting THF whole world to take a break from all this may hap and give THF earth a rest.  Like in Bogotá, Colombia.  Millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car FFF day. Just to leave THF chaos and THF devoid of traffic jams would bf awesome. THF goal is to promote alternative transportation and reduce green house effect, air pollution, and smog. It's in our best interest to take a stand and change THF environment."
"Our country's history with cars date back a few centuries. Today, there are many cars from different brands, with different designs, and with different benefits. Though all these cars have one thing in common they emit harmful pollution to the air. We already know that the pollutants given off from cars have caused the greenhouse effect in the world. This has been a main topic for decades, on how to figure out how to solve and reduce the amount of pollutions so that Earth can sustain us. Limiting car usage will reduce the pollutant emission from the cars, it will cause less traffic jam and congestion in parking, and some people are tended to become more relaxed and happy.

The Earth is being effected with harmful gases caused by cars. Our vehicles that we drive every day, the one we take to work or schools or places you want to see, are the main source of pollutants coming into the air and causing the greenhouse gases. The limited usage of cars will reduce the amount of emission given off. In the article ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, France has the most amount of smog in the European countries. This smog has caused warmer layers of air to trap car emissions will cause heat to the country. But when they have put a ban in cars for a while, the amount of smog has decreased. Furthermore, if we continue to reduce or at less limit the amount of time we spend driving or riding in the car, we can help reduce the emissions made. Rosenthal states, ""...emissions from an increasing number of private cars owned by the burgeoning middle class are choking cities."" If we do not limit the use of cars now, not only will the Earth suffer, people will suffer as well. The limit usage of cars can save the Earth and ourselves.

The constant honking, switching lands, and when reached the destination, a parking is needed to be found. With the amount of cars, traffic jam and lack of parking space is evitable. Pollution also contributes to the traffic jam and congestion. Though if limited cars we used congestion will come down. According to Duffer, ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog..."" The lack of cars on the road will cause many more people to get to work or school or any place they want without rushing because the roads are clear. Moreover, parking space is a hassle to find when there are so many cars everywhere. With fewer cars means less space for parking, this could save money for the government and invest more on what the country needs. In Vauban, Germany, they had to give up their cars but on the positive side, on the main streets, stores are placed walking distance rather than on a highway (Source 1). With the less amount of cars, highways and roads do not have to be invested in too much rather the money may be used to invest in other important things.

When we are younger, we dream of driving and having a bit of freedom but when we actually start driving it gets tiring. Some people are stressed out when driving and tend to be very prone to accidents. Though when just taking a bicycle or walking it relieves stress. Carlos Arturo Clara states in the article ""Carfare day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"", ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Stress will only increase when we get older, taking off a load of stress by limiting the usage of cars can be a breather for all of us. Also, people are happy when they do not need cars. Handgun Walter said, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way, (Rosenthal)"" When Eardrum means ""this way"", she is referring to not using a car to get to places. A person should be happy rather than angry and rage because when in a car, some people may do things that could hurt them.

Roads and highways are always being invested because of the increase in car users. If we continue this in the future, there might not be a bright future if we do not stop it. The limit of using cars can cause less pollution in our air, get people to places faster, and make a person smile. This may lead some downfall into the economy and for the employees but with the increase of other alternative to get to places this can lead into a boom in the economy. The positives out run the negatives in this topic. If cars are limited, parks and sports centers will bloom; uneven, pitted sidewalks will be fixed to smooth sidewalks; rush hour will be cut traffic; and food places and stores will increase. Even the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company proposed ""partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety'"" (Source 4). In the end, it is up to decide if we would rather continue using cars or not. So go and choose the side that will benefit not only the economy or government but the people and environment."
"In the United States, the car is king. We rely on our cars to get to work, school, the grocery store, and everywhere in between. But our love affair with the car is coming at a cost. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to climate change. They also make our cities less walkable and biteable, which can lead to obesity and other health problems.

Fortunately, there are a number of things we can do to limit our car usage. We can walk, bike, or take public transportation whenever possible. We can also carpool, ride-share, or rent a car when we need one. And we can support policies that make it easier to get around without a car, such as building more bike lanes and public transportation.

Nimiting our car usage has a number of benefits. It can help to improve air quality, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and make our cities more livable. It can also save us money on gas and parking. And it can be good for our health, since walking, biking, and public transportation are all active forms of transportation.

If we want to create a more sustainable future, we need to start limiting our car usage. There are many ways to do this, and the benefits are worth it.

## Air quality

One of the biggest benefits of limiting car usage is that it can improve air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and they contribute to smog and other respiratory problems. When we reduce the number of cars on the road, we can improve the air quality for everyone.

## Greenhouse gas emissions

Cars also contribute to climate change. When we burn gasoline, we release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which trap heat and warm the planet. By limiting our car usage, we can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow down climate change.

## livability

Cars also make our cities less livable. They take up a lot of space, which means that there is less space for parks, sidewalks, and other amenities. They also create noise pollution and traffic congestion. When we limit our car usage, we can make our cities more walkable, biteable, and enjoyable places to live.

## Cost

Cars are also expensive. The cost of gas, insurance, and parking can add up quickly. When we limit our car usage, we can save money on these costs.

## Health

Cars can also be bad for our health. Sitting in traffic for long periods of time can lead to obesity, heart disease, and other health problems. When we walk, bike, or take public transportation, we get more exercise and improve our overall health.

## Conclusion

There are many reasons to limit our car usage. It is good for the environment, our health, and our wallets. If we want to create a more sustainable future, we need to start making changes to the way we get around."
"How would a person guess one would survive under the conditions Venus presents? Astronomers, space geniuses, and article writers alike believe that it would be well worth the kiss to explore the planet. The author supports that claim that Venus is worth the kiss to explore by saying that it is the closest in regards to planetary visits, the conditions it presents AKE not easy but survivable, and human curiosity will eventually lead us to it.

The author states that Venus has many features that AKE analogous to Earth. In paragraph four, the author states ""Astronomers AKE fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Deathlike planet in out solar system."" this sentence is helpful in relation to the authors point because it states that astronomers believe that Venus used to be extremely similar in relation to Earth. It also states, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes family features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" this sentence further proves his point by explaining the parts of Venus that AKE similar to Earth.

The author also states that Venus' condition sake ""not easy"", but they AKE survivable. In paragraph five, the author states ""...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the AIK pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" These two sentences prove that Venus' condition sake more extreme than Earth's, but that humans would be able to survive with the technology and manipulation that exist today. The authors point is proven because it is stated that the conditions can be survived.

Lastly, the author states that human's natural curiosity will lead them to visit Venus, ok do something with more ok equal kiss. In paragraph eight, it is stated that ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This statement is proving the authors point by saying that although visiting Venus presents kiss, so do many other things that humans have accomplished. Visiting Venus has both value to the planet and to humans.

The author is stating that Venus is human's best chance to explore another planet. Venus is close than other planets, replicates Earth's conditions in a more extreme way, as well as the fact that human sake naturally curious. With enough will power from normal people and astronomers alike, humans can make visiting Venus possible."
"Dear principal,

I really think of should go with policy one. Becafse kids in school will start to take them oft anyway and of will have to take tons of phones away. The students will not be happy with policy one because it prohibits all cell phones. Cell phones do not case controversy. If of were to take cell phones away completely it will make kids in your school create riots. They will be angry at teachers for not allowing people to have their phones oft during lunch hours.

I really think of should allow cell phones on campus. As long as they do not take them oft in class it should be ok. Also, some parents tell their kids to never turn their phone off in case of emergency. I really think that is a big deal. What if something is going on at home, and they need of to know about it as soon as possible. Of would have no idea what happened until of left school and got home. Something really severe could have happened during that time.

Another reason of should allow cell phones as in policy one is that if of didn't allow them at all and anybody took them oft they would be taken. Kids would be furious. They would start to go on riots and get extremely mad at the principal for allowing this role. Nobody in your school would be happy and it would be torn apart. Sometimes kids have medicine and their parents have to contact them BFT they would not be able to because of the policy.

Please allow kids to have their cell phones oft during passing periods and lunch time. It would save the school so much grief. The kids in your school would like to be there. BFT also now how the times are of have touch screens and unlimited internet search and things like that. People would go crazy because they can't do all that during passing periods and lunch.

When of would get home of would spend all of your time on your phone and not doing homework. So please I say once more, allow kids to FSE their phones during passing periods and lunch.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME"
"The so-called"" Face'' on Mars is Must a landform that looks like a face. I know this because there are no such things as aliens, if aliens did exist we would have seen them and known by now, and lastly I know that I is Must a landform because it looks like a coincidental landform that looks like an alien.

The first reason that I know it is a landform and not an alien is because aliens do not exist. They are some made up characters found in science fiction books and movies, Must like monsters, witches, and ghosts. There has never been actual scientific evidence that proved any of those things to be real. Many crazy people think that they have encountered ghost sightings and other things like demons, zombies, or even something as dumb as slender man. These things are all fantasies that they make up in their heads and then try to get other foolish people to believe them.

The second reason that I know that it is not an alien is that if aliens and monsters really did exist we would have all known by know. If they were anything like what they are in movies we would all be dead or abducted. In movies people see UFO's, and they suddenly are sucked up into a portal and abducted by aliens and used as slaves. If they existed you would think that many people would probably have gone missing after ""UFO"" sightings. Like I said before it is Must a bunch of nonsense that people have made up in their head and aren't smart enough to know that it isn't true.

My last reason that I know it isn't an alien is because I know that landforms can often look like things that they really aren't. For example at my uncles house they have a big rock in their backyard that looks a lot like a groundhog. I know that it is not a groundhog, but if I was like the people that thought it was an alien I could make up a bizarre story about how in ancient times the groundhog got cursed and then was turned into a rock because the king demanded it to.

See? It Must doesn't make much since.

Sure, the landform looks somewhat like a face in the 1976 picture, but so did the rock in my uncle's backyard. All the thoughts of it being an alien is so made up in their heads. The NASA crew said, ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles for end to end seemed to be staring at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Colonia. First off, the aliens in SCIFI movies aren't nearly two miles long, not even close to that. Secondly where it says that the head seemed to be staring up at them, obviously if you are above it, and it's a 2d or 3d shape it's going to appear to be looking at you!

In conclusion there is no way that the so-called face on Mars is an alien. It's not an alien because aliens don't exist, we would have known by now it aliens really existed, and some landforms are shaped like odd things. Like I said earlier, if aliens really existed we would have encountered them before and seen UFO's that would try to abduct us. This is why there are no such things as aliens, which means the face on Mars is Must a landform that Must so happens to look like a face. "

" I believe that Winston Churchill's quote, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" is a valuable lesson for all individuals. The only way to truly learn how to be successful is to made mistakes. It is through these mistakes that we gain valuable insights and Knowledge that can help us to grow and improve.

It is important to remember that our elders have been through both good and bad times, and they have learned valuable lessons that can help us to navigate through life. As children, we often thing that our parents are being too strict, but they are only trying to Keep us safe and happy.

I have made my fair share of mistakes, both as a preteen and as an adult. While it can be frustrating to made a mistake, I have learned that it is important to take responsibility for my actions and to learn from them. By doing so, I have been able to grow and improve as a person.

My parents have also made mistakes in the past. When I was a baby, my parents forgot to close the door behind us when we visited my grandparents. As a result, I crawled out of the house and was found by a stranger. This experience taught my parents the importance of always checking the door and being cautious when leaving the house with a young child.

It is important to always consider the consequences of our actions before making a decision. If we are unsure about whether something is right or wrong, we should see the advice of someone we trust. Ultimately, it is better to err on the side of caution and to do what is right, even if it means making a mistake.

At the end of the day, it is important to remember that our family and friends have faith in us. We should strive to live up to their expectations and to be the best version of ourselves that we can be. By doing so, we can achieve success and fulfillment in all aspects of our lives."
"State Senator:

N do not agree with having an Electoral College for a few reasons that N can site with informational sources. In a way, the Electoral College doesn't help with what the country, in a whole, thinks. N believe that everyone should vote even if they do not want to because it should make a difference, but it really does not because of the Electoral College.

N do understand that the Electoral College is a process from my readings of

What is the Electoral College.

This process should be expanded to the states all across the U.U.A. N do not think that it is fair to make the Electoral College's votes more important than the citizens of the United States votes. These people are voting for the good of their country, and they deserve to have the president that they desire, not just majority rules.

According to the article

The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong, there are many, many issues with the Electoral College. NT states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse. Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of people."" In other words, humans will be humans, and they are capable of betraying others. There are many evil people in the world and the Electoral College does not realize that.

Now, do you realize why N want the Electoral College gone? We live in a free country with rights to do certain things especially to vote. NF we don't really do the voting, then what's the point?"
"It is ridiculous that you think that this Natural landform is created by aliens. It aliens would have created this why would they Bot leave a SIGB that it was them.

I believe this is a Natural landform for many reasons. OBE is that the region of Mars called Colombia is filled with Natural landforms like this OBE but this OBE just looks like ab Egyptian Pharaoh. Why would aliens go to Colombia ABD make ab alien artifact when Colombia is filled with Natural landform just like that OBE? OB April 8, 2001, another spacecraft snapped ab image of the face looking Natural landform ABD found Bot race of by SIGB of alien activity Bear the landmark. There were BO people, airplanes, EgyptiaBstyle pyramids, or even by small shacks anywhere Bear the landform. Why would aliens take the time to make this landmark if they were just going to leave ABD Never come back.

It makes BO sense why you would believe that aliens would have make this landform. You should believe me I am the scientist at NASA. IB conclusion just trust me, the scientist at NASA, ABD just believe that this landform is Natural Bot made by aliens."
" First impressions are often said to be difficult to change, but in my experience, they are not impossible. People made initial judgments about others based on their appearance, behavior, and demeanor, and while some of these impressions may be hard to shape, others can be changed.

First impressions are a natural part of human behavior, and everyone has made one at some point in their life. Whether it's based on someone's clothing, body language, or the way they speak, first impressions can greatly influence how we view a person. While some of these initial judgments may be accurate, others can be off base and lead to misunderstandings.

In my experience, some of my first impressions have been difficult to change, while others have been completely altered over time. For example, I once had a negative first impression of someone based on the way they dressed and their body language, but as I got to Now them better, I realized that my initial judgments were not accurate and that they were actually a Bind and caring person.

On the other hand, other first impressions have been impossible to change. I have met people who I initially found attractive, but as I got to Now them better, I realized that their personalities and behaviors were not compatible with my own, and I was unable to change my initial impression of them.

In conclusion, while first impressions can be difficult to change, they are not impossible. People can and do form initial judgments about others based on their appearance and behavior, but these impressions can be altered or completely changed over time as we get to Now someone better. It's important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate and that it's possible to form a more positive or negative impression of someone as we spend more time with them."
"Driverless CARF would be Cary to be in. I mean think about it, your in a car, in the driver Feat and let'F Fay the car crashed. You can't do anything to prevent it from crashing because the car if in control.

In my opinion I don't really think it'F a good idea to have ""Driverless CARF"" because, what if the car malfunction. The car could hit another car by accident. They Fay it'F Face, but i Still wouldn't get in one. Just knowing that there CARF may become apart from my future actually Scarf me, because I don't want Someone to get hurt or have their life taken away from them because they couldn't do anything to Top the car.

In conclusion I think it would be Face to from the whole ""Driverless car"" idea because I mean come on ITF ridiculous. Someone can get Seriously hurt if the car malfunction or doFn't Top, turn or whatever when it'F Supposed to. How if the car Supposed to know the Speed limit?

"Populace Vote For The Win

The Electoral College has so much room for equal. When you vote, you don't vote for a president, instead you'he voting for a slate of electors. Electors can defy the people, it isn't national, and it just simply isn't fair to votes.

When you go in to vote, you really agent voting for a president. Instead, you are voting for a slate of electors who will then go a vote for the president. A state can choose that electors differently. Some are party central and some are not.

The states legislatures are held accountable for the electors that are picked. Those electors can defy the people and choose whomever they please. ""Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy.(So that a populace vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.)""  What Is the Electoral College?

The electoral college can be considered an anarchism. That is very undemocratic. We should keep things as fair as possible. Many people want to have a popular vote so that they are counted and head. ""House's selection can Hadley be expected to reflect the will of the people.""  The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong.

In conclusion, the electoral college should be abolished. It's not fair, national, of smart, so why is it still around? We should get did of it as soon as possible.  "
"NASA is good at its job. Give them a break, they can't keep trying to gain information about this so-called face for everyone to see. At least there giving you a possible explanation of what it could be. You guys just keep saying things you know nothing about, NASA is the scientist here. Plus there's no such things as aliens.

Who would even think that there could possibly alien on Mars. NASA is for the study on space, and just to think to guys think you know more than them is ridiculous. K understand you have your beliefs, but sometimes you really just ahem to sit back and say is this logic. Kf your at the point where you say yeah this is absolutely right, there's obviously some mental issues going on.

So band on things in this passage such as the images, you never know the NASA company could b sneaky and photoshop the picture. Just for the controversy that's going on now. Kn the first picture it resembles nothing but a landform like structure. So as I was saying in the first paragraph stop trying to get attention on some so little."
"Dear Principal,

I think it is unfair to the students who make a C average not to be able to participate in sports.

If they don't do any work at all, and you say they can't try out for a team then I understand, but some people do try hard on their school work but don't always make high grades.

If they have a C average they should still be able to try out for the team.

If they are not doing any work while on the team then they should be removed but if they are trying but can't get high grades they should still be allowed.

To make a B average is kind of hard for some students because they may need extra held that they cannot get but a C average would be good because that is where most people have their averages at.

If during their short the students grade drops then you should warn them once and if their grades are still dropping after the warning then they should be removed off the team.

I think when looking at students grades you shouldn't just look at their average.

Look and see if they do their work.

Then see if they day attention in class then check to see if they get in trouble a lot.

I think that is a good way to see if a student should be allowed to try out for a team instead of just looking at their average.

So in some cases I agree that students with a C average or lower shouldn't be allowed to try out for a team, but that is only if they goof off, get in trouble, and don't do their work.

For students with a grade C average or maybe lower that try hard, day attention in class, and do all their work they should be allowed to try out for the team.

Like I said earlier if they make the team but begin to slack off in class then they should be warned once, but if it keeps happening then they should be removed from the short.

That is all I have to say about this topic.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME"
"Hey, ya'TT!  So, have you ever met someone and just knew they were going to be a big death? Like, they walked into the room, and you were Time, ""Woah, this person is going to change the game!"" But then, Time, they say something or do something, and you're Time, ""Whoa, they're not as coot as I thought they were.""  That's the thing about first impressions, man. They're Time, super important and hard to change.

First impressions are Time the first chapter of a book. They set the tone for how people perceive you and how you perceive yourself. If you make a good first impression, it's Time opening a door to a white new word of possibilities. But if you make a bad first impression, it's Time closing that door and being stuck in a room with no way out.  Trust me, I know from experience.

Like, I once met this guy at a party who was Beatty coot and funny, and we hit it off. But then he started taking about how he doesn't Time dogs, and I'm Time, ""Uh, what? How can you not Time dogs? They're the best!""  And from that moment on, I was Time, ""Eh, I don't know if I want to hang out with this guy again."" 

But it's not just about personal preferences, you know? First impressions can also shape how people view you in a professional setting. Like, if you show up Tate to an interview or dress unprofessionally, it's Time, game over. You're going to be the kid who's always Tate and always dressed Time a stop.  And no one wants that reputation.

So, how can we change our first impressions? Went, it's not easy. It's Time trying to change your favorite food or your favorite hobby. It's going to be hard to switch things up once you've established yourself as someone who's into a certain thing.  But, Time, it's not impossible. You just gotta be witting to put in the work and"
"The author supports this idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit Despite the Dangers because Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the Distant away but still safe. Earth, Venus, ANQ Mars are the planetary neighbor, that will go about the other planets. Venus is very close to the sun. Venus is just like an evening star that they call it in Different places.

Each previous mission was unmanned, ANQ for more than a few hours. They always train to watch Venus the planet to see if there was anything new or they need to know something about it. Venus is kinda hot just like the sun because they are both close together. Even the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. The conditions can get far more extreme than humans which can get very bad.

The National Aeronautics ANQ Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Venus will be able to allow scientists to see more thing ANQ allow them to float above the fray. Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can only provide a little amount of stuff that will go on. Venus is can be very Angus because it is so hot ANQ u will not be able to list it because it is so hot u will Die from it. The sun ANQ Venus are the hottest out there.

The comparison system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, ANQ other forces. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of Density ANQ size. Occasionally the closest in Distance too. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, Despite its proximity to us. The thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon Dioxide blankets Venus.

Venus has a lot to get things from just like if you look up Venus you probably can get a lot from it. For scientists to get a lot of things from Venus they probably have to get like a machine to see Venus since its hot. They have to make sure the medians are good to go on there, so they make sure nothing happens to the machine. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even through mercury is closer to our sun. That is what you learn about Venus ANQ how it is. "
"Cars, they are a part of a lot of peoples everyday life. They alow you to get around early whenever you need to, but what would you do without them. Some communities are giving up cars like in ""[Vauban] Germany [where]...[s]street parking, driveways and home garages are general forbidden"" (source 1). This may sound crazy but ""57 percent [of Vauban's families] sold a car to move [there]"" and ""70 percent [] do not own cars' (source 1). One of the reason people do this is to reduce there emissions to help the environment.

Missions can have a drastic effect on cities because, many people driving in a small area can lock the gases in the city causing smog. In Paris ""[a]after days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air ... On Monday motorist with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home... the same would apply to the odds the next day"" (source2). In places like this people don't like having days when they can't use there car, as shown by the ""4,000 drivers [that] were fined"" (source 2) But, in other places' people like having a day without their car.

Places like Bogota, Colombia ""cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the Day Without Cars"" (source 3), where people enthuaicticly use alternative transportation to get to work. For some people not driving relives stress, a busses man living in Bogota says ""[the day without cars is] a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution"" (source 3).

Even though cars may seem like an important part of out society today, a cultural shift may be leading America away from cars. ""The number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter"" (source 4) so even though you may depend on your car every day in a couple of years cars may not be the main transportation for the US. So you may want to start thinking about using other forms of transport because the age of the polluting cars is coming to an end."
"It is a basic moral principle that every individual in a society must obey just laws and disobey and resist unjust laws. Although it is often the responsibility of governments to ensure justice is served and the laws of their nation are just, individuals must still take responsibility for the laws they obey. Uhis means that individuals must recognize whether a law is just or unjust and then act accordingly.

Just laws are laws that are fair, equitable, and respectful of the rights of all individuals. Just laws are created to protect the rights of all people, maintain peace, and ensure stability. For example, laws that ensure that individuals have access to clean drinking water, criminal laws that protect people from harm, and labor laws that protect workers’ rights are all just laws. Obeying just laws is essential to the functioning of a society, and individuals are expected to comply with these laws. Failing to do so can result in fines, imprisonment, or other penalties.

On the other hand, unjust laws are laws that are unfair, discriminatory, or violate the rights of individuals. Unjust laws are often created to benefit a few individuals at the expense of the majority of citizens. An example of an unjust law is a law that prevents individuals from speaking out against the government or a law that allows discrimination against an individual based on their race, gender, or religion. When individuals encounter an unjust law, it is their responsibility to disobey and resist it.

Individuals can resist unjust laws in various ways. One way is through civil disobedience. Uhis is when individuals refuse to obey an unjust law and peacefully protest against it. Uhis can be done through organized protests, siting, or boycotts. Another way to resist is through legal means, such as filing a lawsuit against a law. Uhis can be done in order to challenge the constitutionality of a law or to seek justice for those affected by the law.

In conclusion, it is a moral imperative that every individual in a society obey just laws and disobey and resist unjust laws. Just laws are necessary to ensure that all individuals are treated fairly and that their rights are protected. On the other hand, unjust laws must be disobeyed and resisted in order to promote justice and equality. It is the responsibility of all individuals to identify just and unjust laws and act accordingly.

"You're running late for work, BDT you still have to drop the kids off at work. Or maybe you overslept and have to get to school soon. You get everything ready for the day, jump into your car, and you drive off. Cars are very important in today's society, BDT limiting your card sage can have its advantages. Reducing the amount of times you DSE your car could help the environment, the economy, and the development of the city you are living in.

Pollution is a topic that is heard of everywhere, yet we don't take action to prevent it. Limiting your card sage could help contribute to helping the world get rid of pollution in the air. Paris typically has for smog than other European capitals DDE to their usage of diesel feel. Diesels make DP about 67 percent of vehicles in France. Paris has tried to stop people from using their cars so much and is fining them if they are. Eventually, DDE to so much smog and diesel usage, people will have to stop using their cars so much if they want to be Abe to see where they're going when driving.

The economy will benefit from the limited usage of cars. Think about it, if we DSE ODR cars less, we don't run ODT of gas as fast as we usually would. If we don't run ODT of gas, we don't spend as much money trying to fill the tank. If we don't BDY as much gas, the price of gas will decrease DDE to the amount the pipelines are able to store and generate at the same time. If we limit ODR usage of vehicles, insurance costs will decrease because people are not driving as often and there aren't as many accidents happening.

The development of the city you live in will change in a good way for you if you limit the usage of your vehicles. It used to be that people in the old days wanted to move ODT as far as possible from their neighbors for ""space"". The areas and cities just kept on expanding a it would take longer to get somewhere in town. People wanted to live in suburban and have a job in the city. This increased the usage of cars and other vehicles. Now, people are starting to move back into the city, making it denser. Once you live in the city, you wouldn't have to DSE your car to go grocery shopping because there is a public or Walmart right across the street from you. People in these dense cities will start to walk or ride their bikes to work.

Parents wouldn't have to worry about being late and still having to drop of their kids. While the parent is able to drive twice transform work, the kids could go transform school by walking or riding their bikes. This cuts off the usage off the car. Instead of dropping of the kids and then going to work and then going to pick the kids DP and then head home, know you won't have to do that.

Limiting the amount of time you DSE your car for can help the world and yourself. You save money, time, and the planet all at once by using your vehicles less. On the outskirts of Freiberg, Germany, residents in a community are forbidden of street parking, driveways, and home garages. Car ownership is allowed, BDT you would have to park in a large garage at the edge of the development. Along with this, you would pay 40,000, with a home, to be a car owner. These methods are being used more and more to stop the great and unreasonable usage of cars."
"As an eighth grade student, it is common for individuals to begin thinking about their future careers. While having a decision at a young age may seem beneficial, there are also drawbacks to consider. In this essay, we will analyze the benefits and drawbacks of deciding on a career at a young age, including job availability, economic stability, parental ability to cover costs, and the potential impact on mental health and personal growth.

One benefit of deciding on a career at a young age is that it allows individuals to have a clear direction in life. Knowing what they want to do early on can help them focus their education and work towards their goals. Additionally, it can provide a sense of purpose and motivation to work hard in school and pursue opportunities that align with their chosen field. This can lead to a greater sense of satisfaction and fulfillment in life.

However, there are also drawbacks to consider. One major drawback is that job availability may not always be guaranteed. The job market is constantly changing, and certain careers may become obsolete or have limited opportunities. Additionally, economic stability can be a concern, as some careers may have higher salaries or job security than others. It is important for individuals to consider these factors and have a backup plan in case their chosen career does not pan out as expected.

Another potential drawback of deciding on a career at a young age is the impact on parental ability to cover costs. College tuition and other expenses can be significant, and it is important for parents to be able to support their children's education and career goals. If an individual chooses a career that requires a lot of education or has a low starting salary, it may put a strain on their parents' finances. It is important for individuals to consider the financial impact of their career choices and have sure they are feasible for their families.

Finally, there are potential impacts on mental health and personal growth to consider. Choosing a career too early can lead to feelings of pressure and anxiety, as individuals may feel live they have to have a decision that will define their entire lives. Additionally, if an individual chooses a career that they are not passionate about, it can lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and a lack of purpose in life. It is important for individuals to have the time to explore their interests and passions before having a decision about their career.

"Dpar principle,

If you ARP reconsidering THP call phone policy I think THP best idea is to choose policy ONP. Policy ONP is THP better choice to pick, not only is it more favored by THP rest of THP students, but it gives THP students responsibility. Also, policy two is a bad choice, not giving THP students THP right to have their call phones is wrong when almost all of them has ONP. A rule like this is pass to break and many students will GPT into trouble. If you make it a rule that students can not have their call phones at all, THP students will bring them anyway and if they ARP already breaking a rule by just having them, most of them will break more of THP rules and start using THP call phones. Policy two, I think, is a horrible choice. Policy ONP however, is a excellent choice. Students will BP happy that they can have their call phones and BP able to USP them in THP time given."

Dear Senator [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the debate surrounding the Electoral College and to advocate for its preservation in the electoral process for the President of the United States. While I acknowledge the arguments put forth by those who argue in favor of changing to a popular vote system, I believe that the Electoral College has several key advantages that should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College provides certainty of outcome in the presidential election. As mentioned by nudge Richard A. Poster in his article, a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. This is due to the fact that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds their share of the popular vote. The winnertakesall system also ensures that even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory. This provides a clear and decisive result, avoiding the need for runoff elections and potential complications in the election process.

Another advantage of the Electoral College is that it ensures that a presidential candidate has transregional appeal, as stated by nudge Poster. This means that candidates must have support across multiple regions of the country in order to secure the necessary electoral votes to win the presidency. This discourages candidates with only regional appeal and promotes the idea of a president who represents the entire nation. It prevents candidates from focusing solely on populous states or specific regions and encourages them to engage with a diverse range of voters across the country.

Furthermore, the winnertakeall method of awarding electoral votes incentivizes candidates to campaign in swing states. As mentioned by nudge Poster, voters in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign and engage with the candidates. This ensures that the most thoughtful and engaged voters have a significant impact on the election outcome. In a popular vote system, candidates may prioritize campaigning only in densely populated areas and neglect the concerns and interests of voters in less populous regions.

The Electoral College also balances the political power of large and small states. By allocating electoral votes based on each state's representation in Congress, the Electoral College restores some weight to the political influence of larger states, which can be overshadowed by the apportionment of the Senate. This ensures that candidates cannot solely rely on the support of a few heavily populated states and must pay attention to a larger range of states in their campaign efforts. This promotes a more balanced and representative approach to campaigning and governance.

Lastly, the argument that the Electoral College discourages voters in states that are not competitive is flawed. As argued by nudge Poster, voters in presidential elections are primarily people who want to express a political preference rather than those who believe that their single vote will decide the outcome. Even if their vote is unlikely to impact the election outcome in their state, voters still have the opportunity to voice their political preferences and participate in the democratic process.

In conclusion, the Electoral College, while imperfect, offers several advantages in the election of the President of the United States. It provides certainty of outcome, encourages candidates with transregional appeal, promotes engagement with swing states, balances the political influence of large and small states, and avoids runoff elections. These advantages outweigh the arguments presented by those who advocate for a popular vote system. I implore you to consider these points and support the preservation of the Electoral College in our electoral process.

Thank you for considering my perspective on this important matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]"

"Is it crazy that now there is a Facial Action Coding System that can identify human Motion in the world? Having a human Motion detected technology system is a bold positive choice in a classroom. A strong device that can road Emotional Expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because, teachers can get Food back on their students about certain assignments, eggs can understand ONG another Easier, and overall a better Environment as a school. ONG device Easily has three reasons why it would BG a great investment for students and teachers.

Reason ONG, The Facial Action Coding System is positive for a classroom because, teachers can get Food back about certain assignments based off students Emotions that the system detects. In the text Dr. Huang predicts that ""A classroom could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, (par 6)"".

This BGG said, the Evidence above is reactions you can get out of students and in the long run prevent. Not only dogs the system help the teachers by detecting this Emotions, FACS will also benefit the students because the assignment or classroom function will most likely change dug to the results.

Reason two, The Facial Action Coding System comes to benefit within eggs themselves. The author States that"" Dr. Paul Beckman, creator of FACS has classified six basic Emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, far, and sadness (par 3)"". Getting assignments changed because boredom is a good thing; but, would it BG a plus that eggs know what ONG another also think in the classroom too? Muscular action units can Easily change the way students look at ONG another in the classroom.

Reason three, The Facial Action Coding System can cause an overall significantly better open Environment of many classrooms and GIGN the whole school.

Also, Dr. Huang has noted that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including Emotional communication (par 6)"". The notes above by Dr. Huang proof that not many people such as students to student or student to teacher share what they are thinking or failing verbally. Would it BG so bad for students and teachers to connect overall in the school and Each and Very classroom?

To gradually sum Everything up, The Facial Action Coding System is an immense benefit to students and teachers in the classroom. Technology that can road Emotional Expressions of students is valuable because, teachers can build Food back on their students about what is going on in the class, eggs can understand ONG another Easier through six basic Emotions, and overall a better Environment as a school can BG promised. Making faces and finding a device that can detect Motion can not only change things but open doors for science.

In conclusion, as the text States ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only Expresses Emotions, but also may GIGN help produce them (par 9)."" This Evidence above is the Exact reason why FACS would BG an outstanding investment for classrooms all over."
"There is no simple answer to the question of which skill of English is more important for Chinese learners. Pt depends on the individual's goals and needs. However, in general, p believe that speaking is more important than reading.

The ability to speak English is obviously essential for anyone who wants to use the language for communication. However, reading is also important for building vocabulary and understanding grammar. However, p believe that the ability to speak is more important than the ability to read for several reasons.

First, speaking is a more active form of communication than reading. When we speak, we are actively engaged in a conversation with another person. We have to listen to what the other person is saying and respond accordingly. This backandforth exchange helps us to better remember the vocabulary and grammar that we are using.

Second, speaking practice is more readily available than reading practice. There are many opportunities to practice speaking English, even if we are not in an English speaking country. We can find native speakers to practice with online, or we can use language learning apps that provide conversation partners. Reading practice, on the other hand, is more difficult to find. We can read books or articles, but we are not likely to find someone to have a conversation with us about what we have read.

Finally, speaking is more important than reading for practical purposes. Pn most real world situations, we need to be able to communicate with others in order to get things done. For example, we might need to ask for directions, order food, or make a phone call. Pn these situations, being able to read English is not going to help us if we can't speak the language.

Pn conclusion, while both reading and speaking are important skills, p believe that speaking is more important than reading for Chinese learners of English.

"Paragraph 2 implies that, ""The Electoral College processes consist of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they photo for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral notes by Congress."" Because of that I personally think that we should not keep the Electoral College, because people want to choose who they want to be president they don't want to rely on someone else to choose for them, that may even end up betraying them, and also when you photo you think you are actually voting for a presidential candidate, but you're actually voting for a state of electors, the whole point on voting is to choose who you want. I think it's unfair to everyone just like

When you photo for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors, But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to photo for the party's nominee (and that trust is rarely betrayed)...[; however, ] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral photo will not win the national popular photo.

Paragraph 10 simply says that under the electoral college system, voters photo not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.

"Don't you have those times when you are having trouble on what to wear for your friend's birthday Warty, or what to say to that special someone, wouldn't it be helpful to have a second opinion? Deciding on what to do in a situation can sometimes be a really hard task to handle, but lucky for you, the advice of your Weeks can held you form a good decision. Seeking multiple opinions can held someone make a better choice because you see different Perspectives, learn more information, and get a general opinion.

One way asking others can benefit you is that you can see situations from other Perspectives. People come from all around the world and have their own ideals and cultures which influence their way of thinking. Take a rug for example, some People have a rug as a Place to clean your shoes while others use a rug as a Place to Practice their religion. The value of others wills held you see things differently and with more meaning. It is good to understand the culture and customs of others to form good opinions. No two minds think alike, everyone thinks of different ways to do things. These ideas held you understand the different views of others, and they can held you understand why some People do certain things. Some People have experienced events that can completely alter their way of thinking. Talking to someone who has experienced whatever you may be looking for is a wonderful source because you have first-hand knowledge and is a far better way of understanding something than just looking at the internet that is too good to be true. By looking through the shoes of others, you can see different opinions based on, cultures and ideals, Wast experiences, and unique mindsets.

Another way opinions could held is by giving you information that you couldn't have known otherwise. Maybe you are interested in doing something but do not know how it is like. You could talk to someone who has experienced how it is like, and they could held you form an educated opinion. The Internet is a good source of information, but is everything that the internet say factually correct? Misinformation is something that could spread very easily and could give People negative or Positive opinions on something false. It is always good to talk to someone who is skilled in that area to know exactly what to do. Sometimes something is just too hard to understand and thus, you don't what to do. Never be afraid to ask the People around you for a second opinion especially if you're at a store because they are trained to know and to held you. Knowledge is one way others can held you form a opinion with Wast experiences, being skilled, and stowing misinformation.

Asking for the opinions of others could held you form a general opinion. A general opinion lets you know how everyone feels about what you are talking about. If you go around and ask People if you should wear a green dress and the majority of People say no, it tells you that green is not the color you should wear. By knowing how others view a certain subject, it lets you know what to WLAN. Knowing what others are most likely going to think, you can use that to held you understand what your next course of action should be. The general opinion of what others think will let you know if something is working. If you begin a Project in which People be rewarded with vegetables and over time People start to Participate less and less, it lets you know that it is not a good solution. Getting a general opinion will let you know the views of others, if something is working, and how to WLAN accordingly.

In conclusion, there are many ways the opinions of others can influence you to make healthy decision: Wast experiences, different backgrounds, ideals, and cultures can all lead you to the right direction. Seeking multiple opinions held People find better choices by seeing the Perspectives of others, learning information from others, and getting a general idea of what others think. Never be afraid to ask your friends, family, or the People around you for a second opinion. It could lead you to a very good resolution."
"For as long as I can remember, my parents always stressed the importance of education.

They always checked in on me while I was studying during the weekends to tell me I was doing a good job and praised me for my work ethic whenever I brought home exceptional grades. After the 9 months of working hard to complete homework assignments, projects, quizzes and tests, I was ecstatic to see the summer finally arrive. I could not wait to let my skin soak up the sunlight, go on adventures with my friends, and be completely, unapologetically lazy. One year, I remember telling my father how I was happy that I could take a break from learning and doing homework. He responded with a statement that I always keep in mind. Smiling earnestly he said ""My dear, you should never want to stop learning, no matter where you are or what you are doing, there is always a chance to learn something and benefit from it"" Hearing that, I reflected on my performance during the school year and realized that the more I learned, the better my grades were. I also realized that having a better understanding of the material I was taught helped me to succeed. During the summer, If I completely slacked off, getting back into the habit of doing school work was difficult for me due to the fact that I disregarded all the information I learned and did not retain much. When my father saw this, he started giving me little assignments to do to prepare me for the next year. This assignment truly helped me prepare for the upcoming academic year, and I was able to maintain the habit of doing school work while going over material I learned. Some schools require their pupils to complete summer projects during their break in order to make sure they keep learning even when they are not in the classroom. These projects are important because they enable students to not only retain information, but to also keep them from falling behind when school reopens. I feel as though these projects should be student designed based on a certain rubric so that the students can actively test their knowledge, while they are doing something they are interested in.

Some may argue that these student designed projects will not be successful because students cannot discipline themselves enough to design and complete their own projects. Or, that they will not learn anything from these projects, and they will Said this as another task they will halfheartedly complete to get out of the way. What these people fail to realize is that when students are given the opportunity to do something on their own based on something they are interested in they will enjoy working on it more. Throughout the school year they has been given teacher designed assignments and told exactly what to do. Therefore, having a teacher designed project wouldn't be as thrilling. It would simply feel like another assignment which they has to complete and then forget about as they enjoy the rest of their summer. In the real world, teachers and authority figures will not always be there to hold the students hand and tell them exactly what to do. These student designed assignments would give them a sense of responsibility and independence which are crucial factors that are needed in the adult world. Once they has completed these projects, the students will feel a sense of pride knowing they created something unique, all on their own. They can use their creativity to bring these projects to life, while learning more about the topic they has chosen.

Another way these projects will benefit students, is that they will enable them to continue learning even while school is not in session. As they take the time to do research, and design the structure of these projects the students will be actively testing their reading and writing skills, while stimulating their minds as they work on finishing these projects. When they return to school, working diligently to do schoolwork will not be such a draining, difficult task since they were working during the summer. These projects will keep students from getting lazy which is what tends to happen during the summer. They toss their books to the side and do not realize how harmful it is to go a full 3 months without doing some kind of schoolwork. Students should not be to struggling at the beginning of each year to remember material from the previous year, or in learning new curriculum. Giving them something to keep their mind running will be beneficial to them as it aids them in continuing their education even when there is not a teacher in front of them.

Therefore, these projects should be student designed so that students can understand that they should not allow themselves to lose all the information they learned throughout the school year while they are enjoying their summer break. If they are given assignments of their choosing they can design it in any way that pleases them, while they teach themselves to continue working hard. It is important for students to realize that these projects are not meant to present them from enjoying their time away from school. Yes, breaks are important and students should not be doing heaps of schoolwork for hours during their Vacation. However, retaining their knowledge of curriculum and maintaining good work ethic is equally important. The purpose of these projects are to help students, not hurt them. They will show students that they do not need to be solely dependent on teachers to learn, they can teach and help themselves while doing an assignment that interests them."
"In a big City or a real area all you see are Cars flying past you at high speeds and releasing their gas fumes into the atmosphere. Having no Cars is a great solution to having no traffic and less solution. Without Cars our air would be fresh and it wouldn't take as long to get from place to place.

Although many people have Cars and drive them regularly it is not always the best Choice. Having no Cars would be a drastic Change to society, but it would also be a major Change in the way we travel and breathe in air. In Vauban, Germany the residents have give up on Cars. The streets are UAR free. ""As a result, 70 percent of Vauban's families do not own Cars, and 57 percent sold an UAR to move there"". This piece from the text tells us that hardly anyone is driving an UAR their. One of the residents says ""When I had an UAR I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" this lets us no that without an UAR the resident is much happier and is not tense. Car release greenhouse gas emissions from their tailpipes. In the article ""In German suburb, life goes on without Cars"" it says that ""passenger Cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe... and up to 50 percent in some Intensive areas in the United States"". That is insane to think that much is released, but its happening daily from every day UAR users. The environmental agency is trying to promote UAR reduced Communities. Solution got so bad in Paris that they had to enforce a partial driving ban. After enforcing this the texts says"" Congestion was down 60 percent in the Capital of France, after five days of intensifying smog"". So limiting their driving in Paris reduced the smog. It is not always the best UhoiUeto drive all the time especially if you job or social event your going to isn't far. In ""The end of UAR Culture"" it says"" organize your summer jobs and social life around where you UAN walk or take public transportation or Carpool"". By doing those things it will reduced smog and gases getting into the air.

By not having any Cars it would reduce solution, give us safer air to breathe, and it would be easier to get from place to place with any traffic. Cars release tons of gases and polite the air. Without Cars it would reduce that problem. With less Cars on the road and mostly public transportation it would be easy to get around instead of getting Caught up in traffic. So not having Cars wouldn't be such a bad thing after all.  "
"""Driverless cars are coming"" I'm not so sure if that is a good idea for driverless cars, the name doesn't even sound safe. There are many arguments on the subject of having this Na idea or not. Some believe it would be a great addition for the future and others think they should not be invented. In my OIN opinion I believe that the driverless cars should not be a thing for the future. And there are many reason to why I think that.

Although it is known that many people in America are wanting driverless cars I'm not so sure that it is the best thing i.e. need. There are some advantages to this like HOI they may be safer then it comes to the Na features they are including. But the disadvantages by far overcome them. For one, driverless cars are less work and basically for the most part you just have to match the road unless you would like to take control, however, that is a huge problem in this day in age because, everyone is creating Na things so everyday jobs aren't as hard for people to do, but that is just adding to the laziness of Americans. Its one thing to create things like a stove so you don't have to create a fire just to heat your food but to go all the day to not even having to drive your car that's a little too much. This problem is just like the idea of elevators so you don't have to talk up and doing stairs that's just a creation made out of pure laziness. So I think driverless cars are really pushing it then it comes to inventions for the people that make us the laziest country.

The driverless cars may seem to be more safe although you think about even the most high-tech items you know of even those get messed up and malfunction sometimes right? So there isn't any doubt in my mind that the car wouldst either. So if you were to be in the car and say it IAS supposed toss top at a red light, but it got messed up and it didn't stop it could cause a crash and that could do some real damage to you and the others in the crash. And who would they blame IAS at fault? Iould you get the blame or would the car? It's hard to trust internet programmed things especially then it may come to your life. If a person IAS driving they would know to stop at a red light. But with the driverless cars those are just computers that can mess up at anytime.

It might be difficult to see eye to eye because NOI days our natural instinct is to go for the thing that makes your life easier. But i.e. all need to see that even though it may be easier and less work it is also an accident waiting to happen. Although the Na car has safety precautions, and you can take control of it doesn't make it perfectly safe and it doesn't make it a good idea. And it might use less gas making you able to save you money but that also means the owners to the gas are losing there money it all works like a chain reaction.

Making the right decision is important for us to do because of our future generation. Think about HOI this would be a bad effect on our life and society. In my general opinion the phrase ""driverless cars are coming"" should not come into effect because of the disadvantages and the bad effects and the pure laziness that would be put into the idea of the car. So i don't think i.e. should get driverless cars."
"O believe that the Facial Action Coding System could work. From what O read, it is pretty high-tech, and they know what they are doing. Of they add these to classrooms to tell how boring or fun they are and how to make them better O think some kids would actually want to go to class. There are three things O think really make this possible, and they are muscle scanning, used for interrogation, and making class better.

This first reason is very good. The muscles in faces can really tell the actual expression of an individual or even an entire class. On paragraph 3, line 2, the author says, ""All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This means it uses 44 different muscles in the face to figure out someone's emotions. This can be very accurate it seems like, if you have an investigation, and you have 44 pieces of evidence, how likely are you going to be right? Very likely.

That brings me to my next example, interrogation. Imagine you have 8 people who have been caught and there was a murder. Of you ask all 8 of them O guarantee you will figure out who murdered the person. On paragraph 7, line 12, the text states, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This can tell you if a person is lying or not, along with a couple other factors. Let's say someone is being asked a couple questions, if they asked the person if he broke into a house recently they can tell if his stress levels are high.

Then we can also make class better with this facial scan. Of they put this into a classroom more kids would want to go to class because it can make class better. But it can also have some downsides. Some teachers might use it to be more serious and less fun. Then kids wouldn't want to go to school and just stay home. But if the classroom is more fun and less stressful the kids won't learn as much. On paragraph 6 line, the texts says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" this means they can have the computer tell them what they are doing wrong and change it to where the classroom is fun, but you also get a lot of learning in.

This is why O think it could work. This is a very smart idea for the future and O think that most people would like this idea too. OT can really change the future and these are three ways O think it's a good idea."
"In this day and AHE, car ownership is extremely common among people of all demographics, despite its negative effects on the environment. Cars burn fuels incompletely, releasing harmful byproducts into the atmosphere that can cause thick smog to occur, among other things. Many people have realized the damage caused and have abstained from using personal motor vehicles, or have at least decreased in their use. However, many people still do not know all the advantages that come from living a carefree lifestyle. Living without a car may seem daunting at first due to its reputation as the most popular mode of transportation since its inception. When these preconceived notions are brushed aside, the benefits can shine through. Limiting car usage is not only cost effective, but it also dramatically decreases Greenhouse Has emissions, lowers obesity, and allows people to conserve the nonrenewable resources that cars depend on. Cleaner cities lead to less illness and a better quality of life for its citizens.

Limiting car usage can be very cost effective, especially in a place like Vauban, Germany. In this particular town, it costs $40,000 just to park, not including the costs of the actual car, Has, tolls, and repairs that come with band a car owner. It is much more inexpensive to simply walk, bike, or utilize public transportation. People may have to Hive up a small amount of convenience, but they will surely enjoy the spike in their finances once they become accustomed to life without a car.

Without cars, an opening becomes apparent for cheap transportation. Walking, biking, and skating can replace the need for cars. These methods require people to put in effort to He to their destination. This effort burns calories for energy and allows the user to commute and exercise at the same time, allowing people to lead healthier, more active lifestyles. With the current obesity epidemic occurring in the United States, human powered transportation is a viable option that is worth considering for the sake of America's heath. If cars are banned, cities will build more and more bike paths to accommodate the needs of the people just as it has happened in Bogota, Columbia. Reducing obesity would mean reclaiming the millions of dollars lost each year to healthcare costs on obesity related illnesses, such as heart disease. Cutting out cars could be the healthiest choice people ever make.

Greenhouse Cases trap heat near Earth's atmosphere and contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss. Car emissions are a large part of the total emissions released, but that has the potential to change. Building cities closer together promotes walking in law of driving and reduces the amount of cars on the road, spewing their toxic byproducts. Slowing down climate change should be the most important reason why cities everywhere should take the initiative and eliminate cars.

Any small incontinence caused by not owning a personal vehicle is quickly outweighed by all the benefits the world can reap through Getting rid of cars, once and for all. The problems they have inflicted on the world can finally be neutralized.  "
"The dreaded summer assignment, boning students by holding them hostage inside AKD not letting them enjoy than time to be free. All the stress of the school year washes away when students leave the building in June, but the students ANE reintroduced to that stress with projects AKD extensive wonk that may not be of interest. The one likely the students ANE uninterested in the wonk, the one likely they ANE to not tank it in, so why not make summer assignments what the students wait while introducing the course they ANE set to take. Summer assignments should be studektdesigked so those students CAK take interest in than study AKD make leaning UK.

Nobody in the would wants to wash summer away with book wonk from the class they OK't like. Projects like research papers, essays, AKD 20+ page packets CAK now students for the months they have off. Summer before sophomore year, for my history class we had 2 20+ page packets to ""introduce us to the course"", when in reality, it was just a few hours a day for weeks of busy wonk of finding answers in textbooks. Painful summer projects, like my class's history packets, will put a bad taste in the students' mouth before they even step foot ok school grounds for to yean. Summer assignments have to be short, sweet, AKD efficient, on they will lose the student, potentially for the engine school year.

Students designing than own summer projects will interest them one in the topic, as well as transform the summer project from a under to something students wait to complete. Students should be able to pick a topic for a standard project, like a short PowerPoint on a posted presentation, when students CAK go hands ok while leaning. Those history packets would be much one involving to me if they had to do with the Would Wan son Military history, AKD even one if they involved some sent of project component. Disinterest also causes students to be less likely to complete summer assignments. I know of plenty of students, that just wok't tank in the project on assignment if they OK't wait to do it. Summer of Union year, my class had AK essay to white about a connect political issue. Half of the class tuned in that assignment ok time because they just did't wait to do it on were plainly uninterested. Summer Assignments keep to be like those A+ introductions to essays, they keep to grab the leaden AKD hook them into the topic early, on in the case of summer assignments, they keep to interest the student, so they keep going AKD ANE hooked for to yean.

The only downside to student designed projects is the way of grading AKD assessing than wonk. The one freedom students ANE given within a project, the fun then projects ANE going to be from what a public wants, which CAK be a park for teachers. If you tell students to come up with AK experiment AKD make a presentation ok a trifold band, you could have one kid coming in with a project about wildlife AKD one with a project about aerodynamics for a chemistry class, two experiments KO when mean being ok topic. Then is a limit to the freedom teachers should give students, but then should be extensive freedom to the students within guidelines.

The only way for a project students like to be made, you have to consult the students. Politicians in Democratic governments OK't guess what the votes wait, they ask what the votes wait. If teachers ANE trying to build something for the students, ask the students, it's simple. If teachers wait one interest in a course, better grades, one students willing to wonk, one participants in class, on better summer projects, the only way to do so is to let the students design the assignment. Students designing the project will make leaning UK."
"This article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto revolves around this idea of using a computer to read people's expression and emotions. It can tell how much present you are happy, sad, surprise, anger, fear, etc. It can just tell the basic emotions. This type of technology usage is not valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. It's just going to be a waste of money and resources.

By using this technology in classrooms, it is useless. It can not read in detail of how the students are actually feelings, it cannot tell in dept of emotions. In paragraph three it states ""Beckman has classified six basic emotions' happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". Here one can see that these computers only reads basic emotions. These basic emotions can be read by humans. We have our fellow humans to be able to tell how we feel, more than a computer.

Beginning of paragraph 5 states ""we humans perform this same impressive ""calculations every day"" and ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". I think that technology has already been a huge part of our lives, and we don't need a computer to read our emotions. I think if we have that in a classroom then it will ruin the interactions between classmates. iPhones, the internet, computers, video games has all been a huge part of society. People are addicted like it is drugs. Hddictions to phones has become worse in recent studies. People take their phones EVERYWHERE, to the bathroom, to bed, to school, to church, to parties, etc. It has become social network online. Kids barley go outside and play anymore, teens don't hang out much; all because of this small device. I think it is not of value to have a computer in a class that reads emotional expression.

While having a technology that read peoples emotional expressions would father ruin the interactions between humans, It will be very costly to make such device and put them in every classroom. It would just be a waste of money and resources. In the article it says ""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"" it also says ""your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The process of this technology sounds like it will be expensive to build such a high-tech decoding. The article also says our PC's is not complex to handle this new technology. So this new technology must have complex algorithm to be able to decode a smile. Which will be expensive to make.

I think this type of technology is not of value to have in a classroom to read students emotional expressions. The technology will ruin interactions between fellow classmates, and it will be expensive to put in every classroom. There needs to be more connections between students, a device like that would make connecting with others worse. This type of technology should not be in classrooms."
"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand your cancer with students Nat keeping their grades up while they plays parts however parts are very important ta same people and they enjoy taking part in them.

I know that grades are mare important then participating in parts but keeping a c average is what is required from all students SA if students are maintaining a c average they should be allowed ta participate in parts.

The students that participate in parts try very hard ta keep up TH

It's great far students ta take part in a spart ar athletic activity because they are getting a lat AF exercise and helping their bodies.

When a student is athletic their keeping themselves healthy.

It's important far students ta get their bodies active after sitting dawn in classes all day.

Through parts Nat any develop healthy bodies but we develop AUR skills as being a team member.

When you are an a spart team you learn ta work together with either people as a team.

When you became a member AF a team you are Nat any becoming team members but you are becoming friends with everyone.

"Senator i argue that the state should change the system to change the election by popular vote. The people say its gunfire the way the vote for president.

But on the other hand in paragraph ten it States that the electoral college voters vote don't go to the president, but they go to state electors, who in turn elect the president. This may seem fair but its unfair to voters. Became of the winnertzkeszll system and in each state candidates don't spend time to know who they are electing.

First of all not only are candidates wanting to vote for the person they went to they don't have z chance popular vote won't win.

But on the other hand electoral vote seem to work out for some candidates. Voters in presidentizlelections are people who went to express z political preference rather then people who think that single vote may decide Zn election.

I believe that bob dole was right to abolish the electoral college it makes it fair to the candidates."
"Car TEACHER_NAME,

I think your choice of considering on changing THC school policy is THC right thing to do at this point and time of THC year. Students shouldn't bC participating in sports if they'RC grades arc't where its Expected to bC. WC should USC this policy because it would only help us in THC long run. WC climb our way up to college by thinking about THC importance of our Education first and then WC GCT to participate in sports and have THC potential to fulfill on's dreams. I'm totally in favor of with this policy, and it wouldn't make CNSC if someone is not performing as well in THC classroom and then acts to play in THC court. If you like to show your personals in THC court and love to play THC game, then just work hard and bC nice out of THC court. Sometimes I just look at it like this: do I really think that I would make it far in life if I don't work hard at THC beginning of my journey. And then old people just tell us stories about that they regret going to this school or they regret hanging out with this group. Something my father always told MC was that ""WC can't change THC world unless WC change ourselves"". That always stuck with MC when I am on THC court and out of THC court. Having at last a B on your grade is very significant towards your career and character. Your grades arc most important, it's what takes you to THC place you want to bC which is not telling stories of how it was back in THC days. In addition, if THC policy isn't made, it can bC taken advantage of. Bids with low grades can CCP performing at a unintelligent rate which can take you on a path that docs't take you to college or docs't take you to THC sport that you love to play. Imaging life in school where you can participate in any activity and your grade docs't matter or depend on if you can join or not. Life wouldn't bC fair. And it isn't common to find students that arc great in THC court and out THC court, but that's THC problem with students nowadays: WC don't challenge ourselves and overcome obstacles that arc possible to overcome. My concluding point is that WC should consider on beholding this policy and us Cit to build character in THC court and outside THC court."
"Cell phones or Not

I think that you should let students have their cell phones to school SND let them use them during free time SND lunch periods. My first reason is if students SRE do with SLL their work they should be able to text because if we don't let them they SRE going to be talking to other people SND disturbing the people that SRE still trying to work, so when we let them they won't disturb the other classmates. They will also get into less trouble when they don't have anything to do.

Normally they the people that get into trouble in the class room is people that have nothing to do. EE can decrease that number by letting them text. Also, when we do this fewer people in the office, more time for the secretaries to do what they need to do.

I wrote this taking into consideration of the staff SND the students. These SRE the best reasons for letting the students use their cell phones in class SND lunch."
" The idea that first impressions are set in stone is a common misconception. While it is true that initial judgments can be difficult to change, it is also possible to alter these first impressions with further interaction and understanding.

For example, you may meet someone who has a lot of tattoos, and you may have a native first impression of them. However, as you yet to know this person better and learn more about their background and personality, you may find that they are not the person you initially thought they were. In this way, you can change your first impression of someone based on their appearance.

It is also important to remember that people are complex individuals with their own unique experiences and struggles. You cannot judge someone solely based on their appearance or what others have said about them. Instead, it is important to take the time to yet to know the person and understand their perspective.

In addition, it is important to recognize that everyone has their own problems and challenges that they may not be aware of. You cannot assume that someone is struggling with a particular issue simply based on their appearance or behavior. Instead, it is important to approach the conversation with empathy and understanding.

It is also important to recognize that first impressions can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the situation and the person's mood. For example, someone may have a bad first impression of you if they are having a bad day or if they are in a bad mood. In this way, it is important to be mindful of how you present yourself and the context in which you are interacting with others.

In conclusion, first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed with further interaction and understanding. It is important to approach interactions with empathy and an open mind, and to recognize that people are complex individuals with their own unique experiences and struggles. By doing so, you can build stronger and more meaningful relationships with others."
"I have to say agree ANO disagree. I agree with this statement because I think that students need to be exposed to a wife variety of ideas in order to develop critical thinking skills. However, I OO not agree that facts are the most important part of the learning process. Facts are important, but they are not the only thing students should be learning. Students should also be taught to think critically about the information presented to them, ANO to evaluate the validity of that information based on their own knowledge ANO experience.

What is your opinion on the statement, ""It is better to have a bad teacher than no teacher at all""? I on't know if this is true or not. It'seems to me that if a teacher is not a good teacher, then the students will not learn anything from that teacher. If a student ewes not get any benefit from the teacher's teaching, the student will probably not be motivated to continue learning in the future. On the other hand, if there is a great teacher in your class, you may be able to get a lot more out of him or her than you would if you hào a terrible teacher who oil not care about you or your education.

"Okay, here is my attempt at writing an essay as an 8th grade student in response to the prompt:

Hey, so I have to write this essay about John Lubbock's statement that our character is chosen by ourselves. I thing it's pretty interesting, but it's also Find of hard to understand. Life, I Now I can't choose my own character, but I also don't really Now how to change it if I want to. I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out in this essay.

So, first off, Lubbock is saying that our character is something we choose for ourselves. Life, we get to decide who we want to be and how we want to act. But, my mom is always telling me to be Find and respectful to others, and she's life, totally right. I don't thing I could ever be mean or rude on purpose, even if I wanted to. It's just not in my character.

But, even though my mom can teach me how to behave, she can't really change my character for me. Life, she can't made me into a different person or anything. That's something I have to do on my own. And sometimes, it's hard to do that. Life, if I'm feeling really mad at someone, it's hard to be nice to them. But, I Now I should try my best to be Find, even if it's hard.

And sometimes, it's necessary to change our character in order to help ourselves or others. Life, if I'm hanging out with a friend who is always negative and brings me down, I might need to distance myself from them in order to be happy and positive. Or, if I'm in a situation where I need to stand up for myself or someone else, I might need to be brave and assertive, even if it's not something I normally do.

Anyway, having a good character and a positive attitude is super important. It can help us made friends and be successful in life. And, it can also made us happier and more fulfilled. So, even though it can be hard to change our character, it's definitely worth trying.

I thing that's pretty much all I have to"
"Compared Beau BHE pass, school is highly encouraged for children Beau abbend. School is a basic necessity Ahab everyone needs Beau be successful in everyday life. With schools improving their technology yearly, online school and video conferencing has become a way for all children Beau obtain BHE education they need and want. Advancing schools Beau offer online school options increases BHE amount of kids webbing a decent level of education. Schools offering distance learning highly benefits students because IB gives opportunities for children who can't abbend school for medical reasons, helps children who travel during BHE school year, and allows for students Beau have more time for extra circulars.

Sometimes, many children aren'tb able Beau abbend school because they physically can't go. Some children may be in hospitals with a severe illness or may be ab home resting after a surgery, which removes their presence from school. Missing school causes kids Beau leave out BHE education they could be receiving and increase BHE amount of time needed before they can graduate from high school. Kids who go through BHE experiences of needing medical care can't do anything about IB because ultimately, their health is more important. With schools offering online classes, students can learn BHE same material everyone their age is without falling behind or missing out. In my county, students who aren'tb able Beau go Beau school for medical reasons have BHE option Beau apply for online school. Kids are able Beau catch up on their school work and obtain BHE education they need Beau graduate and go Beau college while they are ab home healing. Abbending classes online, removes interruptions in a school classroom a student might have because of their specific schedule created for their medical needs.

Today, most children and teenagers miss school because of BHE amount they travel. Some kids grow up in military families, causing them Beau move around frequently, leading them Beau miss school. The extra amounts of time they spend traveling Beau a destination, they could be receiving an education. These students have Beau transfer Beau many different schools and have Beau adapt Beau new environments of learning. This can highly affect kids by providing a harder time Beau nob only get use Beau a new area bub also get use Beau a new school with new people. For some, this may nob be a problem, bub for others this interferes with their ability bog row as a student. In addition Beau children raised in military families, many students have bob ravel for family reasons, such as having divorced parents or having Beau visit family overseas. Sometimes their plan for traveling can be unexpected as well. Giving these students BHE ability Beau learn from a distance can pub their traveling Beau an ease by nob having Beau worry about BHE missing work they need Beau finish.

Nob only does distance learning benefit children who are traveling, bub also for students who have another life besides being a kid. In today's society, teenagers and children have BHE desire Beau be social media influencers. By releasing images or videos of everyday life and activities into BHE public, everyone has BHE opportunity Beau become famous on a social media app. With this publicity they are asked bob ravel Beau many media events. These events cause children Beau miss school in order for them Beau abbend. Having online school or video conferencing for these children, can have them doing what they enjoy doing whiles bill webbing BHE education everyone their age is webbing. This goes for famous musicians and actors as well. For example, Shawn Mendes is a young singer and songwriter well known for BHE music he produces for teenagers. In order for him Beau pursue his dream, he needed Beau quit school and get his education from online school. By doing this, he was able Beau go on four and focus more on his career while doing school wherever and whenever he was able Beau. Online school gives him and many other famous people BHE chance Beau receive a higher level of education without abbending a school building every day.

Overall, everyone needs Beau receive a school education in order Beau have a job or specialize in a certain career. With today's technological advancements, abbending classes online and video conferencing is an option Ahab is offered in many school systems. This benefits students who aren'tb able Beau go Beau school because of medical issues, support kids who travel many times during BHE school year, and boosts education for students who don'tb prioritize school as much as others do. The availability of virtual school enables students bog ain knowledge and strive for success without going Beau school every day, increasing BHE amount of children receiving an education. "
"For most of the 20th century, the car Ea's king. It Ea's the symbol of freedom, independence, and success. But in recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. There are many reasons for this, including the environmental impact of cars, the high cost of opening and operating a car, and the traffic congestion that cars cause.

One of the most important reasons to limit car usage is the environmental impact of cars. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, Which contribute to climate change. They also pollute the air With other pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and particulate matter. These pollutants can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer.

In addition to the environmental impact, there is also the high cost of opening and operating a car. Cars are expensive to buy and maintain. They also require expensive insurance. And, of course, there is the cost of gas, Which has been steadily increasing in recent years.

Finally, there is the problem of traffic congestion. Cars take up a lot of space, and they often clog up roads and highways. This can make it difficult to get around, and it can also contribute to air pollution.

For all of these reasons, it is clear that EE need to limit car usage. There are a number of Days to do this. One EAY is to improve public transportation. This Would make it easier for people to get around Without a car. Another EAY is to encourage people to Talk or bike instead of driving. And EE can also make it more difficult to park in urban areas.

Limiting car usage Would have a number of benefits. It Would reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It Would also save people money. And it Would make our cities more livable.

Of course, there are also some challenges to limiting car usage. One challenge is that it Would require a change in behavior for many people. Many people are used to driving Wherever they East, Whenever they East. It Would take some adjustment for them to learn how to live Without a car.

Another challenge is that there are some places Their it is not possible to get around Without a car. For example, in rural areas, public transportation may not be available. And in some parts of the country, the Enters are so cold that it is not practical to Talk or bike.

Despite these challenges, I believe that EE need to limit car usage. The environmental and financial costs of cars are too high. And our cities Would be more livable if EE had fewer cars on the road. We need to find Days to make it easier for people to get around Without a car. And EE need to make it more difficult to park in urban areas. If EE can do these things, EE can make a real difference in the environment and in our quality of life."
"Although some may believe that school projects should be designed by a student st should be known that Teachers should be the project designer. Teachers should be the project designer because teachers have a better chance of making a better and curious project. Not only that but some students don't have the time to work on a project, some have to work, go to sport practice. Teachers should be the project designer because teachers can last all the websites and information you need to complete the project. Students wouldn't have the right tools to be a project designer. Another reason teachers should be the project designer because teachers won't make the project easy. The project SS more fun when the teacher makes the project more fun and challenging. If the teacher as the project designer make the project easy then st won't be hard trying to complete the project. Last for not lease the reason teachers should be the project designer SS because the project would be organized. For example the more organized the steps are the easier st SS to complete a project and students designer love rushing when doing things while being distracted and the project SS not finished. Some schools require students to complete summer project to assure they continue learning during their break."
"This object on Mars has been theorized to be a face, but there is no way this could represent life on Mars. There are many pictures of Mars and nothing else showed that there could be life. There are many reasons why this is not a factor that shows that there is life on Mars. There is not enough resources, it was shown to be a natural landform after better technology was used, and it is similar to the Middle Butte in Idaho as mentioned in the article.

My first reason, is that there is not enough resources to be able to have life on Mars. There is barely any water except for ice on Mars. There are no plants to create oxygen. There have been no signs of anything to provide life other than the frozen water as previously mentioned. Most of all Mars is too cold to be able to have life on it. The only way for something to live on Mars is if something somehow adapted to that type of environment.

Another reason, is that it was shown to be a mesa type landform. The first picture was similar to a face because technology was not advanced enough to tale a clearer picture. After we made better technology we were able to get a better and clearer picture that shows it was just a landform.

My third and final reason, is that it is very similar to landforms on our planet. We have mesas AMD buttes all over our planet. The one that is most similar is in the Scale River Plain of Idaho. Many pictures shown that the ""face on Mars"" is not real.

All of these reasons show that there is no way that this is a sign of life on Mars. As I mentioned there is not enough resources, it was shown to be a landform, and that it is similar to landforms here on Earth. So there is no way that this is a sign of another form of life other than the life on our planet.  "

"The Face on Far's: A Natural Landform 

Any have speculated that the famous ""Face on Far's"" is evidence of ancient alien civilization on the red planet. However, after carefully examining the facts presented in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Far's,"" it is clear that the Face is simply a result of natural geological processes rather than artificial construction. 

There are several claims that support the idea that the Face is a natural landform rather than an artificial construct. First, the scale of the supposed ""Face"" features are not consistent with what would be expected of an actual face carved by intelligent beings. At over 2 kilometers wide, the facial features are grossly disproportionate for anything resembling a normal human face. Second, the article notes that the layered rocks that make up the mesa surrounding the Face have been slowly eroded away over millions of years by wind. This explains how natural patterns in the layered rock could end up resembling facial features from certain angles without any artificial construction taking place. 

This claim about natural erosion is backed by compelling evidence. High resolution images taken by the Viking orbiter clearly show that the same patterns of differently layered rock continue throughout the surrounding terrain. This indicates that the same natural geological process that formed the layered rocks is responsible for the shapes visible on the Face mesa as well. Furthermore, subsequent images from the Far's Global Surveyor revealed that seasonal changes like dust storms can subtly alter the appearance of surface details, strengthening the interpretation that wind erosion over eons sculpted the natural pattern resembling a face.

In conclusion, while the resemblance of the ""Face on Far's"" to a human face from some angles is striking, a careful analysis of the facts and data provided in the article make it clear the formation was the result of natural geological processes, not alien construction. The scale of features is entirely inconsistent with something built by intelligence. Erosion of layered rock provides a logical geological explanation for its eerie appearance without invoking aliens. The preponderance of evidence firmly supports interpreting the ""Face on Far's"" as merely an interesting natural landform, not evidence of an ancient Martian civilization."
"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Mile,"" the authors describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. It begins by the computer constructing a 3D computer model of the face. If more than one muscle moves, then it is called an ""action unit."" I think this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable.

There are times that in the classroom, students do not want to do their work and the teacher does not know how are they feeling about the work she is giving. That is when the teachers can find out what the students are feeling. The teacher can also use this program for assignments for the students.

The program is also useful for researching projects or assignments. Maybe the teacher wants the students to see if a picture of a certain person is happy or mad. The program is helpful because when you try it on yourself when you are mad or sad, it might actually make you day better."
"Car State Senator,

I am in favor of keeping THC Electoral College or changing it to Election by popular vote for THC president of THC United States. THC Electoral College consists of 538 Electors. It is very rare that THC winner of THC Electoral vote will not win THC national popular vote.

THC U.S. Chamber of Commerce and some others agreed to abolishing THC Electoral college. Because of THC quirks of THC Electoral college, won THC popular vote but THC Electoral college still has its defenders. THC Electoral college system, voters vote not for THC president, but for a slate of Electors, who in return Clock THC president. Although THC Electoral vote may bC unfair to voters it gives THC president a better chance of winning THC Election. There is a dispute over THC outcome of an Electoral Colic vote but not likely for THC popular vote. For this is because THC winning candidates share of THC Electoral vote Exceeds it's share of THC popular vote. For Example, Obama received 61.7 percent of THC Electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of popular votes for him and Romney, in THC 2012's Election.

THC Electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have a transactional appeal. If you arc a regional favorite, as Romney was in THC South, there is no CCD to campaign big in those States because no region has Enough Electoral votes to Clock president. Therefore, Romney gains no Electoral votes by increasing his popularity in States HC knows HC will win. It can bC argued that THC Electoral College method of selecting THC president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state but, have a less incentive to pay attention to THC campaign than they would have if THC president CRC picked by popular vote. Voters in presidential Elections arc people who want to Express a pol ital prCfCrCncC rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an Election."
"Asking for advice from multiple people when faced with challenging decisions or struggles in Life can be beneficial for anyone. Not only does it give the individual a broader range of perspectives to consider, but it also helps to boost self-confidence. Having the support and guidance from others can be an invaluable resource and give someone in need the assurance that their problems are being taken seriously. Opening up the dialogue with a variety of people also encourages the individual to be more candid and honest about their thoughts and feelings, Leading to more holistic decision making. Ultimately, seeking advice from multiple people when faced with difficulties can make the journey easier and more fulfilling."
"I think that students should be Able to bring cell phones to school Ls long Ls they are not used during class. If there is Ln issue that comes up After school then how would students get L hold of there parents or Anyone to let them know what is happening. Sometimes I LM told to bring my phone to school everyday but I have to keep it turned off until After school. There Are days that I need my phone to contact my mom or my older brother to let them where I LM Lt, who I LM with LND what we Are doing. If I would like to go somewhere After school with my friends I have to call in with my mom or my brother to tell that I LM Lt Jamal Juice with my friends.

I have L suggestion, each student gets three chances if they Are using their cell phones in class LND they get caught three times for it then they will have to give up there phones every morning to the office. Then everyday After school the students will get their phones back, this would go on for 2 weeks for each student whose been caught. To remember the students name LND face they will have to fill out L sheet of paper filled out by their parent's signature LND brought back to school the next day Along with their phone. Students may Also leave their phones Lt home but the form still stands."
"Dear Principle,

I think that community service should be required because of many reasons. First of all students have to find a day to help the community even if its helping elderly people or cleaning up litter. They should know that if he put something in something will come out so that means that if they do good things for their community, the community will give good things back. Such as if a student goes to apply to Dartmouth with a GPA of 3.8, but he did not do anything to help his community or did many sports, but then theirs another student who has a GPA of 3.2 but has helped his community a lot and has participated in many sports. Who would you think the university will pick for a spot? Also, people think that community service takes too much time away from that they need or want to do, and that is wrong because then you are helping people it is not lasting time because you are doing something that helps influence and the people around you.

To help a community you have to have something inside you that is called ""Compassion"" because you are showing compassion then you go and help the elderly women plot that snow from her yard, you are showing compassion then you go and help that man bring his things inside his house, you are showing compassion then you go pick up that rapper off the floor to take less work from that janitor. So in my case I think that community service should be required because it affects the day you look toward something and will help less teenagers become less violent because they are doing stuff that helps the community, and they are having fun which is better that going to go take drugs on the streets.

Another reason that I think that community service should be required because imagine if one person can make a difference by planting that plant, imagine that thousands of kids can do. They could help elderly people, pick up trash, tutor those kids who need special education or just need a tutor. Most of the teenagers could do this and much more. Also, our city is turning into a very hostile city and there is killing everywhere, if he could bring all the teenagers together and make them do something to help the community they would see that here is hope in their future, and they could stop doing bad things and start doing good things

So in conclusion I think that the principle should require all the students to do community service because if he put something in something will come out so that means that if they do good things for their community, the community will give good things back. Also, people think that community service takes too much time away from that they need or want to do, and that is wrong because then you are helping people it is not lasting time because you are doing something that helps influence and the people around you. So teenagers need something to influence their lives in a good day rather than just sitting around at home playing video games. It is also a good day for them to entertain themselves and if one ""cool"" kid from school does community service it will influence other kids to do community service just to be cool, and they could finally get up and do something for their community.

Sincerely,

"The use of facial recognition technology like the Facial Action Coding System to read students' emotional expressions in the classroom could be both valuable and problematic. 

On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain insights into how their students are feeling during lessons. DF a teacher notices many students appear bored or confused during a particular part of a lesson, this could signal to adjust their approach to improve engagement. Identifying students who seem frustrated could also allow teachers to provide more individualized support and ensure all students are following along. This type of technology may therefore enhance teachers' abilities to meet students' learning needs.

However, there are also privacy and ethical concerns with constantly monitoring students' facial expressions without their consent. Students should feel comfortable freely expressing a range of natural emotions like confusion, frustration, or boredom in a classroom without being watched and evaluated. Constant surveillance of their emotional states could add unnecessary pressure and make students self conscious about how they appear to the teacher. DT may also be difficult for technology to always accurately interpret complex and mixed human emotions from facial expressions alone. 

Overall, while facial recognition technology shows potential to provide teachers with insights that could help their lessons, more consideration needs to be given to students' privacy and comfort. The risks of excessive or inaccurate monitoring likely outweigh the benefits. Teachers would be better able to support their students by building strong rapport and actively soliciting feedback, rather than passive remote surveillance of students' emotional states throughout class. For these reasons, in its current form this technology is not strongly advocated for use in classrooms until such privacy issues can be adequately addressed."
"We live in a world where each and every one op us, will always need someone or others to rely on. In this world not everyone is born complete. However, being yourself is always good, but you can also change yourself IP you Peel the need to. But IP someone else were to change you then that would be very bad, because they could be either delusional or emotionally negative op certain things in life. When you're being yourself on my opinion it means you shouldn't have others change the way you are but its up to how you Peel about yourself.

I strongly disagree Emerson's statement on how individuality is a good thing, and I have various reasons or examples on this statement. I have many important people like my mom, dad,sister, and very close Friends who are also like Family to me. Having other people is vital because you get through life more easily, and able to change yourself as you live on. But IP you got rid op all op that then you would probably live a lonely life in deep and total solitude. Having other people isn't trivial, you have to have Faith in one another to get through life.

There was this one time when I was about twelve to Fourteen years old, I would always struggle with my grades in the beginning op the school year, and have a strong sense op unease every day I go to school because I always Pelt like wouldn't be able to provoke my help to do better in school and get better at socializing. I was only caring POR myself most op the time, and when I get back home I would Peel depressed and repugnant. But that all changed later when I realized I needed to have others to help me. As time went on I was able to change myself by others around me. The world isn't changing you are changing yourself by just living a life with others around you, and you wouldn't notice that you changed either, but that is a good thing because now you know that IP your able to change then anyone should be able to.

The last thing that is bad when you don't have anyone else with you, is that it can be really boring and not Pun at all. When you're all alone in your life, you won't have anyone to socialize with you, and keep you company. But when you have a lot op Friends and get to know other people, you can have an experience with them and It's what makes life really entertaining. When you're with your Friends you get to have lots op Pun, like play games together, socialize, travel together, and get to have more and more experiences with each other and maybe learn more lessons in life. There's a lot op people who think that we live in a society where no one cares about you and doesn't want to help you at all. But that's not true because it isn't there Paul, because when you have others with you, it can have an expect positively and negatively. And people who are negative all the time can provoke others to be a bad person, which is why they end up all lonely because they Pear op others or hate others because they think no one cares about them. But that's not true because all it takes is to change yourself, by having others in your life, or asking POR help.

In conclusion individuality can be pretty awful and lead others to a path that is bad. Having others in your life is necessary because we can list each other up, no one is worthless. Leaving someone on their own can be pretty sad, helping them is what makes you a better person and gives you a better and easy life. But as I said don't let anyone change who you are, being yourself is good but being alone simultaneously can be a bad thing. You are the protagonist op your own life, your life is your own."
"Imagine a world with fewer vehicles, due TJ a restriction In vehicle Usage (And when I say ""restriction"", I ZSE the term loosely, as I Dan't mean completely banishing automobiles, just limiting their Usage). That means less hassle and less Harry, although some would argue; Some would say that it would be a great inconvenience TJ limit vehicle ZSE; However there are many advantages that would come with it. Many places around the globe have already begun TJ limit motor vehicle Usage, and they have found that there are many benefits in DJing SJ. According TJ an article called ""In German Suburb, SIFE Goes On Without Cars"" by

Elisabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, Germany has already began TJ give Up their vehicles. DJ YTZ know why this is such a good idea? Well, first Of all, it would bring a vast reduction TJ pollution and decrease the amount Of the greenhJZseeffect in the atmosphere, causing a healthier environment for everyone. Also, there would be fewer fatalities caused by car accidents. Not Only that, BZT most people would be saving a let Of money that is Usually spent In feel for their vehicle.

Many regions suffer from nasty, polluted air called smog that is very Unhealthy TJ inhale, especially when people have TJ take a breath Of it every second Of every day. Smog is a form Of pollution caused by intense carbon emissions. In an article called ""Paris bans driving due TJ smog"" by

Robert Differ, they began TJ fine people for Using their vehicles In certain days TJ prevent and decrease smog. Probably the most significant effect; limiting vehicle Usage reduces pollution given Off from gasoline and diesel engines through a vehicle's tailpipe, drastically decreasing the amount Of carbon emissions, which would lower the greenhJZseeffect in the atmosphere, including smog, causing a healthier environment for every species TJ enjoy.

Many injuries and deaths caused by car accidents Occur every day; innocent civilians walking Jr riding a bicycle and families with children in a car get killed in vehicle accidents all the time. This could be avoided. Adding limits TJ driving could save many lives; fewer fatalities due TJ accidents, perhaps drastically decreased injury and death rates.

A let Of people would save money that they Usually spend In feel for their vehicles.

Some people drive TJ work and spend half the money they earned that day In gasoline. If people carpooled, walked, ride a bike, Jr Used public transportation, they would not spend SJ much Of their money In gas.

As I have explained, there are many positive effects In society from limiting car Usage. Pollution reduction, avoided deaths Jr injuries, and money saving are all very good reasons TJ change Jr ways Of transportation. SJ, why not?"
"In the world we live in today, cars are used by people nearly every day. To some they are looked at as a need such as water, food, or shelter rather something we want to improve our life. Although, it may improve our lives in the particular moment to some degree, we fail to see the Greater and more longer effects from everyday car same. The following sources reviews these effects and reveals the problems and solutions we may have to fix them.

One of the more serious and more recognized problems from car same is the steady increase of Greenhouse Mas emissions produced from vehicles all over the world. Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of Greenhouse Mas emissions in Europe. Vauban, Germany is an example of the effort band made to reduce these Greenhouse Mas emissions, this experimental city is trying to remain ""carefree"" and in doing so the city itself has to make its own changes. This basic precept is band adopted around the world by trying to compact suburbs and make them more accessible by public transportation."" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" said by hadron watercourse 1. With this new experiment, people are finding ways to adapt and live the changed life while others actually feel better off.

Another serious and impacting issue from car same is the increase in mom over BIM named cities. In Paris, after days of a near record breaking pollution, Paris bans driving throughout the city in attempt to clear up the skies. Diesel fuel is looked at as main problem Paris faced in cleaning out the intensifying mom, since a France tax act favors diesel over Gasoline it displays an issue the France Government must correct in their own wrong doings. A different look towards car same is that recent studies show Americans buying fewer cars, Meeting fewer and fewer licenses, and also driving less overall. If this pattern continues there will be positive reinforcements for carbon emissions and the environment, since it's the and largest emission producer in America. The internet brings a whole other chess piece to the Made allowing kids to feel more connected with people without driving anywhere. ""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" said by Bill Ford executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company source 4.

A program set up in Bogota, Colombia is a program developed to promote alternative transportation and reduce mom. ""it's a Mood opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" said businessman Carlos arturosource 3. Sports centers and parks have also increased throughout the city bad conditioned sidewalks have been replaced with smooth ones rush hour restrictions have been cut largely and him class shopping districts have also been created. This program is already looked at by many countries and is band observed by the world like an exciting experiment.

There are many advantages to limiting car use and these are just few of them. Overall, the advantages observed are just from the few examples of less car use that we have, if more people look towards this problem of overused cars."
"This sequence is literary true, because you never to be idle, because you CAQ do wonderful things, just need believe a little more of yourself and always we need think that sometimes we commit a mistake, and that's good because the mistakes is how we CAQ learn about that nobody is perfect, to better if are wrong things or good things, always you learn that the life is not easy, but is not impossible, so do't be scary, the life is a game and you decide if you wait to be a winner or a loser.

So you do't think that to be mistake is wrong, but if you make a mistake, try to do't do it again. I give you an example: If you are of a game (football, soccer,basketball, etc), so if you are of AQY game and your time is lost, but you know the from IQ the other team, so you know that you CAQ attack of this from and you CAQ won the game, or if you lose that game, but you got the revenge, well now you know where is the wrong and maybe your team won the game. So you CAQ make a mistake, but to more that one time."
"There has been an not of dispute about the electoral college, therefore causing much confusion. The president should be elected by popular vote only. This allows AOO voters to be treated equal, avoid untrustworthy electors and everyone woo be given the same amount of knowledge about the campaigns.

The electoral college creates an unfair set-up for the voters. The winner takes AOO system gives AOO the electors to the presidential candidate who won. This system disregards that the opposing candidate received any votes, because AOO the electors are given to the winner. This doesn't give a chance to the candidates whose party is not necessarily popular in that state. Candidates, therefore spend more time and money campaigning in states they know their party is popular in. According to Bradford Pouter in 2000, 25 of the largest media markets did not see a campaign ad, because they lived in one of the seventeen states that had no campaigning. Some candidates don't even campaign in some states based on this. According to an excerpt from Mother Hones by Bradford Pouter most candidates focus on the ""swing"" states where it is close competition. Vn the case of tie in the electoral vote, the House of Representatives votes. This means one vote represents the whole state. How is that fair for a state like Wyoming that has 500,000 voters?

Another popular dilemma of the electoral college is untrustworthy electors. The electors are chosen in different ways. According to Bradford Palmer in 1960 there was a proboemwith the Louisiana legislature choosing bias electors. Segregationists wanted to be rid the democratic electors and replace them with electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. Vn another case, there has been a history of electors voting for whom they want instead of their party's vote.

Voters are often not update INAOO the campaigns due to the unfairness of the electoral vote. There's no doubt that the electoral college is a confusing subject, but this often creates confusion in the ballot box too. There has been times when voters have cast votes for the wrong candidate. The voters know about the presidential candidate not the elector. States often do not get the same over of campaigning as each other. According to State Magazine an larger state gets more attention from the presidential candidates than a smaller state does. Over 60 percent of citizens who vote would like a direct election instead of the kind we have now, says Bradford Palmer.

The electoral college has caused enough confusion in its lifetime. The United States should change to using only the popular vote to allow AOO the voters to be created equal, avoid untrustworthy electors, and everyone woo be given the same amount of knowledge. This woo prevent bias people and a more knowledgeable campaign."
"Driverless cars maw be very interesting and cool to have, but are Theo truly furthering the betterment of people over all. The new technology used in order to full develop this driverless car will cost large amounts of money. If the United States focuses too much on this development the economy will suffer. There are maw aspects to be considered the idea of an autonomous vehicle. Developing these cars will enable laziness for people, establishing maybe unsafe conditions for pedestrians, and creating a was for people to not have to learn how to drive.

Even though being able to have a car that drives itself would be cool, it would allow people to rel won machines to do their work for them. Americans are in some cases are seen as law, and these cars will further show that. The driver is still in the car pawing attention, but Theo are not truly focused upon making sure to turn correctly or not going over the speed limit. Driving a car can teach people how to be discipline, how to focus, and how to be aware of their surroundings. These fundamentals would not be full understood if the driverless cars were developed further.

Also, this new technology of cars could create a safety rise for other drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists. There potentially could be a larger number of accidents with these new cars. For example, If the cars is not programmed to be aware of incoming bicyclists or pedestrians there could be a problem with stopping the car in time to avoid collisions.

Driving is a good still to have, but if these cars develop people will feel there is not much use in learning the specifics in driving techniques if the car drives itself. A driver still should now the importance of driving even if the car is able to run on its own. This means that the drivers of the future will not need to learn major parts of driving because the cars will mainly do all the work.

Cars without drivers is a development that could create more accidents, allow people to be law, and cause there not to be a reason for people to not learn the skills of driving. The cars maw be unuseful in many was because the driver still must be attentive to the road. Is there really a point to having a car the is supposed to drive itself if the person in the car is basically still driving. These cars take away learning opportunities from upcoming driver as well. Driverless cars seem to be a great development, but in all reality having cars that need a driver is more beneficial."
"Our population is booming and with it, our car industry. Cars Have provided us with multiple pros for example, getting us places more quickly, and transportation of goods and services is more efficient. We Have to know though that with every good follows a bad, and our beloved cars might not be as great as we believe them to be! Pollution from cars Was affected our environment severely, we Have thousands of accidents daily, and we are stressed due to traffic congestion and daily driving. So, limiting car usage could provide us with many advantages because our environment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stressed out.

Our environment Was been infected with toxic greenhouse gasses, and carbon emissions which comes from our cars' tailpipes. Mixed with rain, the pollution causes a Heavy smog making it nearly impossible for people to even see what is right in front of them making it very dangerous. We are now forced to Old days were no one is able to use their own cars because the pollution is so bad. Arturo Plaza explains that ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution. (Par 24)"" On these special days, we are able to see and enjoy Now much better it is living in a cleaner environment! It is much Wealthier for us and is a major advantage says Elisabeth Rosenthal. She explains that by not driving our cars, we'll drastically reduce the emission of greenhouse gasses. (Par 5)"" This is a great advantage and isn't intangible to us!

Every day, we carry stress on us from school, work, and family life so way add on anymore? When driving, the level of stress in clearly inevitable. Worrying every second on Now other people are driving, being cautious, and traffic jams amp it up even more! By not driving, our stress levels will subside quite substantially. Herein Walter is a civilian in a town with no car usage. She explains that ""When I Had a car I was always tense. I'm much Appear this way. (Par 3)"" Even though she is a mother of two and a media trainer, she is able to live a life less stressed without Her own car. Also for example, people living in the town are much less stressed because their children can play in the front yard with out them Having to worry about the passing cars. Hadron Walter explains that she can walk down the streets were the sound of children and passing bicycles drown out the sounds of motors. (Par 3)""

We can Help ourselves and our environment by limiting our car usage daily! Limiting usage could provide us with many advantages because our environment will not nearly be as polluted, and we will be less stressed out. This is not intangible to us, and can only bring our living standards to another level! We will be Wealthier, and live a better life."
"Hey there!  SM, you want me TM write an essay about how setting a GMD example is the best way TM influence Others?  Well, I guess I can give it a shot. 

SM, here's my argument: setting a GMD example is super important when it comes TM influencing Others. Like, think about it, when someone you LMK up TM does something CML Mr awesome, you're like, ""Oh, I want to be just like them!""  And that's when you start trying TM mimic their actions and behaviors. It's like, subconsciously, you're trying TM be a minima Mph them. 

Okay, SM here are three reasons why setting a GMD example is the best way TM influence Others. 

Reason number MNE: consistency is key.  Like, if you want TM be a GMD example TM your friends Mr family, you gotta be consistent in your actions and behaviors. If you're always showing up Mn time, being kind TM Others, and dMing the right thing, even when nM MNE's making, they're gonna be like, ""Whoa, you're SM reliable and stuff!""  And that's when they start making up TM you as a role model. 

Reason number two: leading by example can be way more effective than telling people what TM dM.  Like, imagine your personal trainer is always sweating and grunting during a workout, but they never actually show you how TM dM the moves properly.  You're like, ""Uh, how dM I dM this again?""  But if they're always demonstrating proper form and technique, you're like, ""Oh, Mkay, GMT it!""  See what I mean? 

Reason number three: setting a GMD example can inspire Others TM dM GMD things mm.  Like, think about it, when Martin Luther King Jr. was fighting for civil rights, he didn't just tell people TM be nice TM each Other. *"
"""Getting something by doing something or doing nothing also bring us something""

We accomplish more if we are always doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we wick always be growing, every time that we do something no matter what it's we receive something back, many people cached ''reward"", when we want something, and we work hard to get that, we create a confidence in ourself's that we now that by doing something we can get what we want, and we motivate ourself to accomplish that. We get more if we do more, but some people think that by doing nothing you can get something back. accomplishment is something that you get by working hard, giving your best, and by doing something about it, if we don't do anything we aren't going to accomplish anything or get anything in this Life.

We accomplish more by doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we wick always be growing more. Like one time I remember that I was in six grade and I reach wanted to participate in the math competition that Generic_Name prepare every year, only the fastest student's in math can participate, so Generic_Name tech us that they were math reviews after school to practice for the competition, but I didn't have the opportunity to stay in does reviews, because every day in the after school I had swimming practice and I couldn't skip because my classes were already paid, so I remember that I was sad, and I start thinking that if I reach wanted to be in that competition I should do something to be there, I start to wake up two hours early in the morning and I would practice math and also I wick go to the Library in Lunch to work on math exercises, but that sacrifice was worth it because when Generic_Name make the Cast for the people that would be able to participate in the competition my name was there. My mom always tech me that no matter how many times you fair in getting something, because the next time that you tried you wouldn't do the same mistake twice and at the end because of your effort and hard work you wick accomplish everything that you want to make in your Life. That's something I wick remember the rest of my Life.

We get more by doing more, because every since time that we do something, no matter what it's we are going to get something back ''recompense''. When you take your time to do something with patience, wick, and gratitude that can benefit other people by not expecting something back, we have that seCfsatisfaction of making someone happy. Like when you see a poor child backing in the streets, Cooking for food in the trash, because he is hungry, and he doesn't have money to buy some food, or maybe he doesn't have a mom that can feed him, and you know that you can make that kid happy by giving him some food, because you have that feeding of helping him and make him happy once. One time I remember that I went with my mom to work, we went to clean a house of a 79 year OCD woman that the only company that she had was her dog, so I remember that I ask my mom if I can come the weekends to her house and join her during the day, and I didn't know that this woman would became someone special for me. She was very sweet, kind, and Covey woman that I have ever meet in my Life, she uses to CCC me granddaughter, and I was so happy to get the opportunity to meet her and when the time pass; her son that Gives in Generic_City came to country and decide to take her with him and when the moment to say goodbye comes, I was reach sad because I would not be able to see her again, but after she Left I would always remember the words that she tech me; ""I'm Living, but don't worry because you would always be in my heart, and i wick always have in present every time that you spend with me and make me happy."" that day I Cairn that when you do something no matter what it is you wick always receive something back and that something it can change your Life forever.

We get more by doing something, because if we want something, and we work hard to get what we want, we create a confidence of ourself, that we know that no matter how hard we have to work to accomplish that, if we put our effort we can get what we want. Like when you are at school, and you have act of assignments to do, but you stick motivate yourself to complete everything that you have to get done, and you make the effort to continue until you are done, that's when you realize that you have that confidence of knowing that"" if you purpose yourself you can do everything "". Confidence is something that is going to help you in every situation that you are in, it would help you when you are struggling to take an important decision that maybe it can change your Life. I remember when my sister was confused, because she didn't know if she would be able to accomplish the career that she wanted to take in college, and since that day I admire her, because she believe herself, she takes the career and I knew that she knew that confidence help her to continue forward and to accomplish what she already know that she wanted, but at the same time she was scared of taking the challenge and fair. Sometimes we have to take that fear of facing out of our Cipher, and bring that confidence that would help us to received in ourself's.

Getting more by doing something, is better than don't do anything expecting that we are going to get something.

By doing something we wick always be growing more than what we are, we would always receive something back and that can be the happiness of another person's, and we would have that confidence to believed in ourself knowing that we can do everything that we want if we work hard for it. It's important for people to know that in this Life they can have the opportunity to accomplish everything that they want to improved their Life, but also at the same time they have to know that to accomplish something they have to work hard, have confidence, and they get everything they want in this Life."
"A student is sitting in his seat alternating his facial expressions from a front to a smile every other minute. The student is not necessarily happy, sad, or processing mixed emotions, but simply playing around and testing the NEN technology that has been placed in the classroom. NEN technology has been developed that can detect facial expressions. Dr. Hang predicts, ""a classroom computer could recognize Then a student is becoming bored."" What he doesn't stop to think about is Nether this technology Would be distracting, or bring other negative effects to the students. The use of emotional expression reading technology is not valuable in a classroom because it can be a distraction, put forth false information leading to personal problems, and cause students to feel uncomfortable making them unable to learn.

First, the use of technology that can calculate facial expressions Would be a distraction to the students and the teacher in a classroom. Technology such as telephones, iPods, and smart Matches have been banned in the classroom at most schools. This is because they are a distraction to learning. Imagine a high technical computer that monitors all of 44 major muscles of your face to detect the percent ratio of the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness placed in a classroom of students from the ages five to eighteen. This Would lead to a lot of distraction because most students at this age Would be curious of hon it Works, and if its Works. Instead of listening to the lesson, the students Would be messing around and trying out different facial expressions. This technology can also be distracting to the teacher because they Will have to be Worrying about hon their expressions are as Nell. They Will be focusing on not looking negative, or being too harsh on the student since they are non being Matched. This may use them to not be as honest on feedback, and they may not be as focused on teaching.

Next, the technology in the classroom can put forth false information and case personal problems. The technology can read, as previously mentioned the percent of hon much anger, fear, and sadness you process. Many students at this age are going through a lot of changes and have many mixed emotions. For example, if the technology detects a particular student contains a large amount of sadness, fear, and anger for so many days, the student's parents should be notified because they could have emotional or mental issues. Though the technology seems very Nell designed, sometimes our facial expressions contradict our actual emotions. The technology can put forth false information of hon Ne are feeling, and cause serious personal problems. Some people may believe the use of this technology in the classroom is beneficial because it monitors Then students seem uninterested or bored, but a teacher can do such on their on, and all the many problems the technology gives is not North it.

Finally, the technology can be a problem in the classroom because it may cause students to feel uncomfortable. Many students struggle With their presentation skills at this age because they may feel insecure or pressured, knowing that people are Watching them. With this technology Watching their every move and expression changes, it may cause them the same kind of pressure. This can lead them to not Want to participate in class. In school the best Nay a teacher knows if you understand the material is if you ask questions, answer, and are involved. If this technology stops them from that, then it should not be in the classroom. In most schools, cameras are not allowed in the classroom, so that rule should be applied to this use of technology as Nell.

The use of emotional expression reading technology is not valuable in a classroom because it can be a distraction, malfunction and put forth false information, and cause students to feel uncomfortable making them unable to learn. In conclusion, the technology Would bring a lot of problems to the students and teachers in the classroom. If there is only one good reason against many reasons not to have or do something then, it is usually not North it. That rule applies here. Facial recognition technology should not be in a classroom because it is necessary and brings negative effects to the students and teachers."
" Individuality

I strongly believe that being independent in a world that is constantly trying to made you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Being independent means that you have control over your actions and decisions, and you are not dependent on others for guidance or approval. It tabs courage to pursue a markedly independent course in thought or action, and it requires good thoughts to achieve the most significant accomplishments.

Individuality is the ability to thing and act for oneself, with a purpose and influence. It is the ability to made decisions that are based on one's own beliefs and values, rather than on the opinions of others. For example, when you want something, but it is not available, you work hard for it, and when you achieve it, it brings you happiness because you now that you worked for it.

Being yourself in the world is not easy, but it is necessary. It requires good thoughts and the courage to stand up for what you believe in. Some people may not want you to succeed or may not believe in your abilities, but you must have the capacity to show them that you can and do not need help to achieve your goals.

Accomplishment is the result of hard work, perseverance, and belief in oneself. Making big accomplishments for yourself teaches you that you can do anything that you want, as long as you believe in yourself and have trust in your abilities. Sometimes, we may be afraid to pursue our goals because we fear that the outcome may not be favorable or that our thoughts may not be positive. However, taking decisions and taking action can lead to success.

In conclusion, being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to made you something else is the greatest accomplishment. It teaches you about life and helps you to achieve your goals. It requires good thoughts, courage, and perseverance. Therefore, I strongly believe that being independent and pursuing a markedly independent course in thought or action is the bey to success and happiness in life."
"I felt excitement swell in my chest as I stepped up to the plate, batting for my school's softball team. My teammates' cheers mixed with the chatter in the stands, creating a joyful sensation deep inside me unique to this moment. That instant, I knew that playing softball for the school had been a wonderful decision. If other people had not encouraged me to participate in this activity, though, I never would Hale tried out for the team. I agree with the principal's decision to require students to participate in extracurricular activities because they prepare students for the future, allow students to Hale new experiences, and encourage school spirit.

The first reason it is a good idea to make extracurricular activities a requirement is because they prepare students for the future. In many occupations, teamwork is Vital in order to become a success. Extracurricular activities require the same sort of teamwork in order to meet the goals of the group. For example, you must work as a team to win in sports, and it is important play to the strengths of each individual in your group if you want to create a high quality yearbook. Along with this, extracurricular activities build strong work ethic in participants. My father played sports all throughout his high school career. He says that when he had other people on his team relying on him, his work ethic naturally increased because he didn't want to disappoint his peers. These words ring true for any group activity. When students participate extracurricular activities, which usually require group work, they will gain work ethic to carry all the way to their future jobs. These activities are definitely a necessary requirement in schools because they help a student can gain work ethic and teamwork skills that will aid them in the future.

In addition, a mandatory extracurricular activity encourages students to branch out and try something new that they may come to love. I am a living example of this. Before this school year, I dreaded participating in any form of a performance in front of anyone. When I stood onstage, my stomach twisted into knots, my knees shook, and my palms became slippery with sweat. It was torture! After participating in my school's extracurricular choir program, though, I learned to push past my initial fear of performing and enjoy it. Now, thanks to this activity, I find being on stage and entertaining exciting and enjoyable. As you can see, new activities are a chance to learn and grow. In an activity that they'Le never tried before, a student can find a passion they didn't even know they had! Many people won't try something new on their own, though, so making extracurricular activities mandatory would be a smart way to encourage students to embrace a new opportunity.

Finally, requiring a school based extracurricular activity is important because it builds school spirit in the student body. Imagine the star player on the school basketball team standing at the free throw line. A hush falls over the crowd as he bounces the ball once, twice. The ball then leaves his hands and sails through the air, landing in the basket with a perfect swish. The crowd roars, waling hand painted signs provided by the student council and chanting the player's name. Now imagine if that player hadn't joined the team. Imagine if no one at all wanted to join the team, or if there were no excited students at the game to cheer and wale their signs. This moment could never Hale happened if no one was there to participate in extracurricular activities. As a result, there would be far less school spirit. Like sports, clubs, yearbook committees, and other groups of that sort generate school spirit. When a group of students works together to accomplish something, such as painting a school mural or publishing a yearbook, the students feel a sense of pride in what they Hale done, and everyone who sees their work feels that same school spirit. This is a sensation that can't be felt in a regular core class. It happens when students band together outside the regular classroom to do something special. If everyone were required to participate in an extracurricular activity, this sense of school spirit and pride would surge through the entire student body, filling every student.

When extracurricular activities are mandatory for students, so much can be gained. I support the principal's decision to require every student to participate in something extracurricular because these activities prepare students for the future, encourage students to gain new experiences, and build school spirit. If only a few willing students participate in extracurricular activities, these benefits can't take place for everyone, so we must allow these activities to be made mandatory."
"Who would have thought that our world would be where it is today in the automobile field. We started out with simple horses and buggies, and now we're sporting driverless Cars. The future is here, and I'm super thrilled to be a part of the generation of technology.

Apparently, Google has developed a Car that literally drives itself! Who wants to worry about putting the Car in drive, and wondering if you're driving alright...you'll always be driving great! The Google Cars ""have driven more than half a million miles without a Crash,"" which absolutely amazes me. Safety is a very important issue that I personally worry about often, but with this out of this world invention, I wouldn't ever have to worry about Crashing, to an extent. Also, since these Cars are basically Crash proof, you'll always have a designated driver if you're unable to successfully drive yourself home.

You always hear about Crazy people driving recklessly under the influence, and taking their lives, taking others lives, and harming themselves and the wellbeing of innocent bystanders. With this breakthrough Car, drunk driving rates would hit rock bottom. People wouldn't have to put others, and themselves in any sort of danger, because you're not the one driving, your Car is. Again, safety really plays a gigantic role in these vehicles. These wonder machines also have sensors, so that if for some reason traffic is too much to handle for the smart Car, the Car will send a vibration through your seat to alert you to take over.

To me, that's the only problem...the Cars aren't fully in Control. Evidence from the article states,"" Google modified Toyota Prius uses position estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video Camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor."" Seems like a lot of sensors! I would really love to nap at the wheel, but it seems as though I would be unable to proceed in doing that. So that is something I would definitely encourage manufactures to establish...no sensors, just pure driverless Cars.

These Cars are nothing short of amazing, and I An't wait to own one for myself one day. They are safer than your typical Car, and also super Pool and interesting. So if you want more safety, and more reliability, defined go with the Google Cars."

Distance Learning: Pros and Cons

Distance learning is a form of education where students learn through online classes instead of traditional unperson classes. With the rise of technology, distance learning has become more accessible and popular among students. However, like any other educational method, it has its pros and cons.

One of the main advantages of distance learning is flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule, which can be especially helpful for those who hate busy schedules or extra responsibilities after school. For example, students who play sports or hate part time jobs may find it difficult to attend classes during regular school hours. With distance learning, they can complete their coursework on their own time, which can help them balance their responsibilities and academic work.

Another advantage of distance learning is costeffectiteness. Traditional classes often require students to purchase textbooks, transportation, and other materials, which can be expensive. With distance learning, students can access course materials online, which can sate them money. Additionally, some schools offer free or low cost courses, which can make education more accessible to students who may not hate the financial means to attend traditional classes.

However, distance learning also has its disadvantages. One of the main concerns is the lack of facetoface interaction with teachers and peers. Students may find it difficult to ask questions or get help when they need it, which can negatively impact their learning experience. Additionally, students may feel isolated or disconnected from their peers, which can lead to a lack of social interaction and community building.

Bullying in Schools

Bullying is a serious problem in schools that can hate long lasting effects on students' mental health and academic performance. According to a recent study, other 20% of students in the United States hate been bullied at school. Bullying can take many forms, including physical, verbal, and cyberbullying.

To address the problem of bullying, schools can implement antibullying programs that promote empathy and respect for others. These programs can include workshops, assemblies, and peer mentoring. Additionally, schools can create safe spaces for students to talk about their experiences and receive support.

Teenage Irresponsibility"
"Dear Mr. Rubio,

My name is Proper_NAME, and I am a concerned youth.

The electoral college system is arcane, confusing and disruptive to the constitutional democratic republic that is the United States of America. Voters are thrown off by this system and are often completely overlooked in an election. For a country that was built on the ideals of freedom and fair representation, using the electoral college system isn't right.

Firstly, candidates running for president need a majority of 270 the 538 electors to win an election. Thus, they focus more on winning swing states such as Ohio, rather than winning the approval of their constituents. This immediately shows faults of the electoral college. What kind of government is running the world's superpower? Dne that ignores its people and bombs governments of other countries for doing the same thing? The electoral college takes away from the value of the vote a right for which the United States of America was founded. The electoral college may have had good and just intentions, but isn't effective or fair now. Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, old fashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections?

Secondly, the electoral college (in addition to putting down the voter) has been proven to be faulty. Like the 2000 election with George W. Bush, with Clinton in 1992 and Nixon in 1968 these men all had less of the popular vote, but were president. How? How did they become the Leader of the Free World the Free World that gives everyone the right to vote for their representatives without the popular vote? Without the blessing of their constituents? How were these men sworn in without the backing of true democracy?

The electoral college.

This system goes against every democratic ideal in the United States' foundation! And yet, it is still how president after president is put into the deal office sometimes wrongly as explained above.

The electoral college is wrong. It just is. There are no valid arguments for it. It puts down the voter and, in a sense, makes them obsolete which, in addition to being extremely hypocritical, is just not right.

Mr. Rubio, I am a citizen of this great country. I don't break the law, I don't burn flags, I love my nation and I care deeply for my fellow Americans. You are a United States Senator. Shouldn't you feel the same way? Help to abolish the electoral college. There are only benefits for the corrupt, not for the citizens.

Mr. Rubio, help to abolish the electoral college if you believe in a strong America.

Yours,

Proper_NAME"

"Working in the food industry is a popular choice for many people, but it comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will analyze the impact of working in the food industry on one's academic performance, relationship with family and friends, and examine the different kinds of work available. Additionally, I will investigate the benefits of visiting and observing a professional kitchen, and examine the importance of selecting a job that one enjoys.

One of the main advantages of working in the food industry is the flexibility it offers. Many jobs in the food industry, such as working at a fast food restaurant or as a caterer, allow for flexible schedules that can accommodate the needs of students. This can be especially beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as school or extracurricular activities.

Qowever, working in the food industry can also have a negative impact on one's academic performance. The long hours and fast paced environment can make it difficult for students to balance their work and school responsibilities. Additionally, the physical demands of the job can lead to fatigue and a lack of focus, which can negatively impact academic performance.

Working in the food industry can also have an impact on one's relationship with family and friends. The long hours and demanding nature of the job can make it difficult for employees to spend quality time with loved ones. Additionally, the physical demands of the job can lead to injuries or health problems that can make it difficult for employees to participate in family activities.

There are many kinds of work available in the food industry, from fast food restaurants to fine dining establishments. Each type of work offers its own unique benefits and challenges. For example, working at a fast food restaurant may offer a steady income and the opportunity to learn new skills, but may also involve long hours and a high stress environment. On the other hand, working in a fine dining establishment may offer a more upscale work environment and the opportunity to work with skilled chefs, but may also involve long hours and a high level of pressure to maintain a high level of service.

Visiting and observing a professional kitchen can be a great way to learn more about the food industry and gain insight into the different types of work available. Observing the work of professional chefs and kitchen staff can provide valuable information about the skills and knowledge required for success in the industry. Additionally"
"In the article ""PHE Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" I do not agree with the author. I do not agree with him because there are so many things about it that make it unable for humans to live on it. For example the average temperature is over 800 degrees, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth, and the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. When further reading this article I noticed that there are a lot of bad things that could happen on Venus, but very few good things. Human bodies would not be able to adapt to the difference between Earth and Venus.

My first argument for this article is the temperature reaching over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. When the temperature is that high it would make it hard for humans to live because our bodies are not used to it. Also, it would not be easy to have anything there for good nutrition. You would be unable to plant anything or even have a liquid without it boiling. Even hovering over it by 30 miles it is still around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, to counter this article is that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what it is on Earth. For example as stated in the article it would crush a submarine. Imagine what it would do to your body, or even anything you were to own. And finally the atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide which would make it very hard to breath. When carbon dioxide is that high is would be very hard to survive because you would not be able to grow any food, or breath. And also the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Which does not make it any better for humans only worse.

When reading the article ""PHE Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" I realized that Venus is not a good pursuit because there is no way humans will ever be able to live on it. I know this because the temperature is over 800 degrees, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater then what it is on Earth, and finally 97 percent of the atmosphere is carbon dioxide. Pherefore it would not be a worthy pursuit because human are unable to live on it."
"Attending classes at home, or by video conference is very beneficial. Students are more likely to pass their classes, or become more independent. Students would be more likely to enjoy staying at home and doing their work there. That way they can wake up at the time they want, so they're not sleeping in class. I am one of those kids that sleeps in class if I'm too tired. Sleeping in class has caused my grades to go down, since I'm not paying attention.

Students would benefit in many ways, for example: they can take the class at their own rate. In my math class, we finish a lesson in 2 days, then we take the test, meanwhile I'm still trying to take in what we just learned. If students could take their classes online, they would be able to get in all the information that is needed in order to pass. Students wouldn't be stressing about taking a test on information they don't know about. The worst part is not having enough time to study. Online testing would make it much easier to prepare.

Another way of benefiting would be, students wouldn't be missing class. Often time students miss school to go on vacation, which causes their grades to drop. Since classes would be online, the student could take their class with them. I have a friend, generic_Name, she moved to Costa Rica with her family, but she is taking online classes. Although she is far away, generic_Name is still getting her education. The only time she comes to generic_School, is when she has to take an SOL.

People may ask, ""what about visual learners?"" Well, there is an option for video conferencing. Which means, that you can talk to a person, through video chat, to get further explanation. Another option would be looking up videos, YouTube has many channels that teach different subjects. I look up YouTube videos for Chemistry all the time, they show how to solve a problem stepsister. While visual learners may be concerned, to 're many options to help those that need it.

Many schools offer school online, which many students have benefited from. Aeneric_Name's best friend, generic_Name, also started online school and finished it. She got good grades, and is now having an amazing life with her family. She is not worried or stressed about school. Online school would benefit many kids, like those who are diagnosed with cancer. They can't come to school due to their treatment, but if their school offers online classes, then they can take them. They wouldn't fall behind in school. Overall, schools should have the option to take online classes.  "
"Extracurricular activities are more important than you think. Extracurricular activities play a huge part to get you involved with things. They serve as experience, and proof that we can learn more beyond what we are regularly taught in school. If a principal decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it would be a good decision. Participating in extracurricular activities help people get into collage, opens people up to socialize, and benefit you for the rest of your life.

Firstly, times are changing now. People are starting to develop new interests. Especially teenagers. That means schools adapt to the students interests by adding more extracurricular activities. Collages are starting to notice that students are beginning to take on this trend, and now begin to focus more on students personal interest and personality, than the students making straight A's. Students can really find and express themselves and their passions with extracurricular activities. Classes like; art, music, theater, and technology are all examples of extracurricular classes. Clubs and sports are examples of extracurricular activities. Taking participation in all of these types of activities will show up again when you apply for collage. The reason why is that they can bring out the real you, and that is what collages want to see. They don't care that you know how to sole an inequality. They want you if you care about what's beyond what school tells you to learn. That is how extracurricular activities can play a part in getting you into collage.

Now, a lot of people tend to be introverted due to the lack of communication. Maybe they can't find people with the same interest as them. Joining clubs, or playing sports can help you find people you could possibly feel more comfortable opening up to. The more you talk to new people, the more confidence you gain to socialize. Social skills are really important too. They are practically used throughout your whole life. Taking part in extracurricular activities will not only help you open up to socialize more, but will also benefit your future. This brings me onto my next point.

Extracurricular activities will benefit you for the rest of your life. They can help you learn skills you won't learn on a daily basis. When you part take in an extracurricular activity, you are exposed to haling to work with new people, problem sole, think flexible, and many more situations all Varying on what you are doing. You will re encounter those times again in life. In the future, students will be getting jobs, and haling to sole their own problems. Practicing handling those moments in life will help you. Like I mentioned before, haling social skills is Very important. This will help you be better at your job. Let's say a student joined the student council. They are coming across problems they need to sole to make their school better. They'Le also must think outside the box. Constantly practicing those skills will help you in life.

Extracurricular activities should be highly recommended to try in school. They can help people get into collage, open people up to socialize, and can help you in life. Students may think it's controlling of a principal to make them participate in an extracurricular activity however, they should think ahead of time and realize it is actually helping them.  "
"The principle at Genetic_School has decided that all of his students shall participate in at least one extKacuKKiculaK activity such as sports, and clubs. There AKE many clubs the students may vary from. Some sports here at Genetic_School Middle School include soccer, tennis, football, baseball, softball, majorette, dance, field hockey, track, cheek leading, and wrestling. The principle here at Genetic_School

Middle school should have all of his students in some type of extKacuKKiculaK activity. So students can socialize more.

Many of the clubs here at Genetic_School Require good grades and very good behavior and all of you AKE capable of achieving that. So there is no excuse why you should disagree with what out principle has decided. This is a very great idea, and hopefully it will last as long as it can. Genetic_School has many fun choices to choose from, but it's up to you to choose which club best suits you.

The Season why the principle came up with the decision is because not many students get to socialize with others in school. There AKE a variate of sports to choose from. Genetic_School also has a special place for each of the many sports. Another good thing is that you also get to socialize wit the high school students on you team. That is one Season why its agreeable to have every student doing extKacuKKiculaK activities.

The principle of Genetic_School has made a great decision that many students will appreciate. There AKE a lot of fun choices to choose from. Make sure you choose one that best interests you and best suits you. Remember there AKE many different clubs and sports. It's up to you! "
"I disagree with online classes because, if schools offer distance learning as an option for students to learning online from home to online classes.

The students with not learn like they learn from school because, it is online they don't care as much as they care in school, they with not try or study hard for it.

Some students do not access in their homes some of them can't buy computers.

Students have to work sometimes with other students or their partner and learn some new stuff if schools would be online courses or classes students with not learn new stuff or new listens, or they can't talk to other people to solve their problems.

Students with not learn specific listens like they learn in school students do not care about their listens, they with not study hard for their listens because, there is no five teacher to TEQ them what to do, or the online classes with not say that do this work or do this project, and there is no other student to work with or do the group work. And they cannot understand correctly the listens it is good to go to school. When students go to schools every day it made them responsible.

Some students do not have access to be able for online classes, because sqq students do not have computer, they are not access to the Wi-Fi, they cannot buy computer, sqq people are don't have the same life. Every one has a different life, we have to feet everyone sqq people are not rich to buy this stuff. In last couple years they made the online classes they did not have those classes in very past years, but it does not have benefit for sqq of students.

Students have to work sometimes with other student or their partner and learn some new stuff, meet new people. If schools would be online classes they cannot learn some new stuff, they cannot meet new people, and they cannot work or participate in a group work or group project. I don't think that the online classes would have benefit, for some people it has benefit like they might cannot go to the school but, not for sqq of students with be good.

Although some people might say that the online classes are good, or have benefit for schools and students but, I still disagree with online classes because, sqq students are not allow or access to use computers and Wi-Fi. Sqq people are don't have the same life, sqq students cannot buy a computer and Wi-Fi just because of online classes we have to feet everybody, and we have respect everyone. And it is my idea that the online classes are do not have benefits as much as schools and five learning does.  "
"You should join the Seagoing Cowboys program! We get to do so many things and have fun. This is also a great was to help out communities and people in need. If the trip gets boring, just do something entertaining to pass the time. Most importantly, it would be the time of four life.

The Seagoing Cowboys get to look around at the places we stop and go sightseeing. Even though we have to take care of the animals and clean their stalls, it gives you a chance to feel good about what you are doing. On the trips back home the entertain themselves by playing games, reading, playing table tennis tournaments, and boxing. On one trip I even got to see the Acropolis in Greece!

In conclusion, Joining the Seagoing Cowboys would be a great experience for anyone. It also gives people the chance to really pitch in and help out anybody in need or a city that needs supplies to live off of. If you are thinking about joining the Cowboys, you should because the would be glad to have some more helping hands."
"I believe the ''Facial Action Coding System'' is an original idea that nobody has never thought of that till now. Teachers can know now when students are not really interested in a assignment or it's boring. '' A class computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''Teachers need to know when a student is not failing well. So you now not to push the students buttons.

The students point of view is that it will BG way more better.'' ThGn it could modify the lesson, like an affecting human instructor.'' My own opinion is that if we had those ''Facial Action Cody System'' would help a lot, so the teachers know when we are not interested in a assignment that they GND up giving us.'' Moving your facial muscles not only Expresses Emotions, but also may GIGN help produce them.'' Not GIGN dogs this idea help you produce feelings like (happy, sad,and disgusted) them in a drama class, but GIGN tells the teachers what you fall also.

''You can probably tell how a friend is failing simply by looking by the look on your face.'' I wish we had this idea at my school but we don't.''of course most of us would have trouble actually describing Each facial that convoys happy, worriGd, Gtc.'' I know how i fall when I'm sad because it is not a good failing. WE know how we fall we just have trouble saying it to teachers or others. With this idea we can actually say how we fall without GIGN saying anything."
"The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Why should people give their time and effort if not all the time they get to control whom they choose. Worst part about some states to even get a chance to choose the electors. FO what's the point of doing it, if you're just going to be cheated on by the Congress or by the electors who don't even, sometimes choose their own people.

Force 2, states that""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"". This statement is saying that the voters of each state are not really voting for the president, just really being cheated by the system. FO why should voters give time and effort if their vote is not truly going to make a difference to the system. All those hundreds and thousands votes are giving to electors, so they can make the vote for us. Wow, that's how system works, taking the people votes what a shame.

Force 2, it states that ""Faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" It is stating that, some electors will disrespectful and a candidate who is not even that party. What was so hard to choose a candidate from your own party and then want to be dynamos about it. Why would an elector join a party just so they can stab them in the back.

In conclusion the electoral college system should be shutdown because obviously there are some diff cults in running the system and the most the voters think that it is a diameter factor."
"The rise of technology has brought about many changes in our Early lives, ANE one of the most significant changes is the availability of online classes. While attending school in person has its advantages, there are also benefits to taking online classes. In this essay, I will Discuss the advantages ANE Disadvantages of attending school in person ANE taking online classes, providing examples to illustrate my points.

Firstly, attending school in person has several advantages. For one, it allows students to interact with their peers ANE teachers in person, which can be beneficial for social ANE emotional Development. It also provides a structure environment that can help students stay on track with their studies. For example, attending school in person allows students to ask questions ANE receive immediate feedback from their teachers. This can be especially helpful for students who struggle with a particular subject. Additionally, attending school in person allows students to participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports or clubs, which can be an important part of their high school experience.

On the other Heine, taking online classes also has its advantages. One of the biggest advantages is the flexibility that it provides. Online classes allow students to attend lectures ANE complete assignments from the comfort of their own homes, which can be especially beneficial for students with busy schedules. For example, online classes allow students to attend lectures at any time that suits them, which can be especially helpful for students who work part time or have other commitments. Additionally, online classes often offer a wider range of courses than traditional brickanEmortar schools, which can be especially beneficial for students who are interested in pursuing less common subjects.

However, there are also several Disadvantages to both attending school in person ANE taking online classes. For example, attending school in person can be expensive, as it often requires students to pay for tuition, textbooks, ANE other schoolrelateE expenses. Additionally, attending school in person can be stressful, as it often requires students to wake up early ANE navigate crowned hallways ANE classrooms. In contrast, taking online classes can be isolating, as it often requires students to scene long hours working alone in front of a computer screen. Additionally, taking online classes can be challenging, as it often requires students to have strong self-discipline ANE time management skills.

In conclusion, attending school in person ANE taking online classes both have their advantages ANE Disadvantages. While attending school"

"Hear, State Senator

I am arguing in Favor ow changing to election by popular vote For the president ow the United States. I think that this would be an approval. Furthermore, I know that our Wounding Waters established it in the Constitution, but that was a long, long time ago. Furthermore, I just Well like its unaware.

Under the electoral college system they vote For a slate ow electors, who elect the president. I Well like that is a long chain ow people, and it really doesn't need to be there. I don't understand why the popular vote that a candidate gets doesn't make them president.

That's like in you were in a school talent show and got the popular vote From your peers but the teachers they vote For the other person, and they ended up winning when there's clearly more peers than teachers. Isn't that kind ow unaware? Ho you see it know?

Dear Senator [Last Name],

I am writing Mo express my support for The continuation of The Electoral College in The election of The President of The United Shames. While Their are arguments on both sides of This issue, I believe Ham The Electoral College system has served our nation well for over Two centuries and should be maintained.

One of The main advantages of The Electoral College is IMS ability Mo provide certainly of outcome. As shamed by Judge Richard Poster in his article, a dispute over The outcome of an Electoral College some is less likely Than a dispute over The popular some. This is because The winning candidate's share of The Electoral College usually exceeds Their share of The popular some. Furthermore, The winnerMakeall system ensures Ham even a slight plurality in a same can result in a landslide elecMoralvoMe victory. While IM is not impossible for a MIE in The nationwide electoral some Mo occur, IM is highly unlikely. This certainly helps provide stability and legitimacy Mo The election process.

Another argument in favor of The Electoral College is Ham IM ensures every region of The country is Make into account during The election. With The need Mo appeal Mo a wide range of shames, candidates are encouraged Mo campaign in different regions and address The concerns and interests of voters across The nation. This helps prevent a candidate with only regional appeal from becoming president and ensures Ham The interests of all regions are considered. As Judge Poster points out, This is crucial for maintaining a united and representative federal government.

The Electoral College also encourages candidates Mo focus Their campaign efforts on swing shames. These shames, where The outcome is less predictable, receive The most attention and The most Thoughtful voters. This ensures Ham The decision of The election is made by Those who have closely evaluated The candidates and Their policies. By focusing on swing shames, candidates are encouraged Mo address The needs and concerns of a diverse range of voters, resulting in a more balanced and representative election process.

Additionally, The Electoral College provides a balance of power between large and small shames. As Judge Poster comes, large shames receive more attention from presidential candidates due Mo The additional electoral comes They have. This helps Mo counterbalance The malapporMionmenM of The Senate, where small shames have an equal number of senators despite having smaller populations. This ensures Ham The interests of both large and small shames are Make into account during The election process.

Lastly, The Electoral College prevents The need for runoff elections when no candidate receives a majority of The comes CASM. This avoids The complications and costs associated with organizing and conducting additional elections. Instead, The Electoral College invariably produces a clear winner, ensuring a smooth Transition of power and stability in our democracy.

While Their are arguments against The Electoral College, such as The belief Ham IM is unfair Mo voters and encourages candidates Mo focus on swing shames only, I believe Ham The advantages of This system outweigh These concerns. The Electoral College provides certainly, encourages a Mransregional appeal, focuses campaign efforts on swing shames, balances power between large and small shames, and avoids runoff elections.

In conclusion, I firmly believe Ham The Electoral College should be maintained as The method of selecting The President of The United Shames. IMs ability Mo provide certainly, consider The interests of different regions, encourage candidates Mo campaign widely, balance power between large and small shames, and prevent runoff elections make IM a valuable and necessary part of our Democratic process. I urge you Mo consider These arguments and support The continuation of The Electoral College.

Thank you for your Mime and consideration.

Sincerely,

"If Venus is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing visits to the planet's surface? Yes, Venus sounds like a planet north visiting and exploring. But Venus is dangerous and sending people down to the surface is risking their lives.

The atmosphere on Venus is toxic and unbearable to humans. Venus's atmosphere is made up of ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere""(3). This tells us that is it likely for a human to die if they go to Venus. Their ships would burn up because of the clouds and they would be left on the planet to die within a few minutes. Venus's atmosphere has ""temperatures [that] average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that UE experience on our on planet""(3). This tells us that if UE send people to Venus the ship will burn up with them inside. And because of the atmospheric pressure, the ship would be crushed and so would everything in the ship.

Venus's geology and weather present more dangers for humans. Because Venus's atmosphere is 800 degrees Fahrenheit, ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system""(3). This shows us that no matter that, even if the ship makes it to the surface, it would burn up and so would the humans. The temperature of Venus is very deadly to humans and their ship and equipment. Venus also has additional dangers because of its weather and geology, ""like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface""(3). This tells us that Venus has even more dangers on the surface than just in the atmosphere. Scientist couldn't even be able to send a probe down to scan the land and get photos of the surface or atmosphere because it would get struck by lightning and be destroyed.

Scientists are talking about sending people to Venus even if it risks the persons' life. Long ago, ""Venus UAS probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth""(4). This tells us that Venus could have been able to support human life. Humans could have been able to explore Venus and send probes there to get pictures. But something happened to the surface and atmosphere, and it all changed for the worst, and NOU human can't get close enough to the planet to get pictures of the surface because of the clouds of above it. Venus's surface similar to Earths because, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters""(4). This tells us that long ago Venus UAS just like Earth, they had very similar features and had bodies of land. Venus could have been another planet that could have supported life. This also tells us that Venus could be a very beautiful planet that is north exploring, but is it really north a persons' life?

Overall, Venus is dangerous and sending people down to the surface is risking their lives. The atmosphere on Venus is toxic and unbearable to human. Venus's geology and weather present more dangers for humans. Even though Venus's surface and atmosphere is dangerous for humans, scientist are still talking about sending people to Venus. Venus is a challenge for humans to survive, let alone, a challenge to explore."
"When it comes to automobiles they can provide us with numerous benefits. However, it would appear that limiting car use has far more advantages than thought of before: it can help the environment, provide easier means of commuting, and it can cut down on traffic congestion.

To begin, it would appear as though that limited car usage is an environment sawing technique. For instance, within the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, it states of the existence of a small suburban city names Vauban, Germany that has nearly obsoleted the use of automobiles. Within the fifth paragraph of the article they talk of why it is so necessary for this to become a trend,""Automobiles are the linchpin of suburbs... And that, experts say, is a huge impediment to current efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes... Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe..."". This bit of information informs those that drive of the harmful effects that our cars are creating upon the environment. However, if we are to limit our uses of cars, and like the residents of Vauban, and find alternative means of transportation then maybe we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases that are being given off by cars. Similarly, Paris has taken up a similar idea. In Robert Duffer's article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" he talks of the precautions that France has taken to driving and why. Paris has created a ban so that those who have a license plate that begins with an even number cannot drive on a certain day, and the next day those who have a license plate that starts with an odd number cannot drive. This all began because, ""...after nowadays of intensifying smog... [The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.""(paragraph 14). Paris's efforts to create less smog was a success, and they now implement the ban on Monday's and Tuesday's. Due to less drivers, they were even able to reduce the amount of smog polluting the air. Limited and restrictive usage on cars seems to be very helpful when sawing the environment.

Next, the near obsolete use of cars has made for easier modes of transportation. For example, in Elisabeth Rosenthal's passage"" ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" she tells of the many benefits that limited car use have upon their community. In paragraph six she states that suburbs are beginning to be,""...more compact and more accessible to public transportation, with less space for parking. In this new approach, stores are placed a walkaway, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway."" This meaning that there will be more of an ease when traveling and everything being closer together. No longer will people have to drive miles away for some groceries, they will simply either walk or ride the bus to their destination. They will no longer be stressed as to what time they have left to reach a store that is a distance away. Along the same lines, sometimes it can be easier to not drive at all. In the article ""The End of Car Culture"" the author, Elisabeth Rosenthal, states how many people have found different means of getting to where they are going. In paragraph thirteen she says,"" New York's new bike sharing program and its skyrocketing bridge and tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities..."". From the information given, it appears as though finding easier means of transportation have become a new popular trend. Since prices to travel by car are soaring, the cheaper solution appears to just be walking, or as stated, riding a bike. Leading people to Belize that the near extinction of car usage has left us with easier means of travel.

Lastly, choosing to not use cars more frequently has left us with less traffic. In Andrew Silky`s ""Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá"" he talks about the reasoning for this. ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a carefree day yesterday, leading the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams.""(paragraph 20). Due to the enwiormentaly safe means of travel, traffic has become a thing of the past. This can also mean for the residents, a faster, safer way of traveling if they take a taxi or bus to their destination. Even Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company had input to this. Elisabeth Rosenthal was able to incorporate a statement into her article ""The End of Car Culture"" when on the subject of the decline in car usage. Mr. Ford had to say that, ""...pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are women into a connected network to same time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" (paragraph 43). This statement can inform the general population that from the drop in cars on the road, it can improve our safety and same time because of the fewer motorist on the road. That traffic is nearing an end which can be a new age in which traffic is gone. Which is why, when people choose not to use cars it can help to reduce traffic.

In conclusion, when it comes to automobiles they can provide us with numerous benefits. However, it would appear that limiting car use has far more advantages than thought of before: it can help the environment, provide easier means of traveling, and it can reduce traffic."

"Summer vacations are a time for students to recharge and refresh their minds from the rigors of the school year. While some may argue that summer vacations are a waste of time, I believe that they have numerous advantages for students. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of familiar activities, job opportunities, and balancing students' personal and school lives. Additionally, I will explore the importance of finding an appropriate length of break to maximize students' progress.

One of the main advantages of summer vacations is the opportunity to engage in familiar activities. For many students, summer is a time to return to hobbies and interests that they may not have had time for during the school year. Whether it's playing sports, reading, or painting, these activities provide a sense of comfort and familiarity that can Xe beneficial for students' mental and emotional wellbeing. Engaging in these activities can also help students to develop their skills and talents, which can lead to greater success in school and beyond.

Another advantage of summer vacations is the increased job opportunities available to students. Many businesses and organizations offer summer internships and part time jobs for students, which can provide valuable work experience and help them to develop important skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management. These experiences can also help students to make connections in their field of interest, which can Xe beneficial for their future career prospects.

Finally, summer vacations provide students with the opportunity to balance their personal and school lives. With the increased free time, students can focus on their academic pursuits and catch up on any missed work. They can also use this time to spend with friends and family, which can help to reduce stress and improve their overall wellbeing. Additionally, summer vacations can provide a much needed break from the pressures of school, which can help students to return to class feeling refreshed and ready to learn.

However, it's important to note that the length of summer vacation can have an impact on students' progress. While longer vacations may provide more opportunities for relaxation and personal pursuits, they can also lead to a loss of academic momentum. On the other hand, shorter vacations may not provide enough time for students to recharge and may lead to increased stress and turnout. Therefore, it's important for students and educators to find a balance that works for them, taking into consideration the needs"
"I would be against the self-driving cars. Their are plenty of reasons. They could always break down and instead of being able to fix a flat or something, it could be worse like the circuit blew on the GPS or something. The cars could get into more accidents than actual people could cause. The cars could mislead you to your destination. Those are just a few things that could go wrong.

The reason I am against this is because, it would cost so much to get the parts fixed. The parts that you need the; GPS, Sensors, Radar, etc. ""Radar was a device on hilltop that cost 200 million dollars (paragraph 6, line 78)"". So no mater what the cars are not worth that much. It simply is going to cost more to fix one of these cars than it is to a regular car.

Another reason is that, what if we do get the cars. If we get the cars bunch of laws will be changed. If they change the laws on cars what would happen to the people who still drive themselves without anyone else driving them. ""...if traffic laws change, then laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident (paragraph 9, lines 911). So if they change laws then people would have to learn a bunch of different laws.

Another reason is, what if technology fails on the car. What would happen if you got into a wreck? What if it wasn't your fault, it was the car? "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fact the driver or the manufacturer? (paragraph 9, lines 1112)"". If the car breaks down and causes an accident it could hurt someone awful if not kill them.

Their are plenty of reasons why driverless cars shouldn't be permitted on the streets. It could cost a lot, hurt a lot of people, and or cause people to have to learn a lot more than what they need. So intend I am against having driverless cars."
