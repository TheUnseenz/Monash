    "# Chapter 7: Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preview\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SQL (Structured Query Language):** Pronounced S-Q-L or sequel. Used to create database/table structures, manipulate data, administer databases, and query for information. \n",
    "* **Supported by Relational DBMS:** All relational database management systems (RDBMS) support SQL, though vendors might add extensions. \n",
    "* **Focus:** Primarily on data definition (creating tables/indexes) and data manipulation (adding, modifying, deleting, retrieving data). \n",
    "* **Common Task:** Data retrieval is a critical skill for database professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 7-1 SQL Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ideal Database Language:** Should allow creating structures, managing data (add, delete, modify), and complex querying with minimal effort and easy-to-learn syntax. \n",
    "* **Portability:** SQL aims for portability through standards (ANSI/ISO), but vendor-specific dialects exist, requiring minor changes when moving between RDBMS. \n",
    "* **SQL Categories:** \n",
    "    * **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** Commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT` for data operations. \n",
    "    * **DDL (Data Definition Language):** Commands like `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX` for defining database objects. \n",
    "    * **TCL (Transaction Control Language):** Commands like `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` to manage transactions (logical units of work). \n",
    "    * **DCL (Data Control Language):** Commands like `GRANT`, `REVOKE` to control access rights. \n",
    "* **Nonprocedural Language:** You specify *what* to do, not *how* to do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-1a Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Definition:** Specifies the kind of data an attribute (column) can store. \n",
    "* **Importance:** Affects query syntax and behavior. \n",
    "* **Fundamental Types:** \n",
    "    * **Character Data (String):** Any printable characters (letters, digits, symbols). \n",
    "    * **Numeric Data:** Digits with a specific numeric value. \n",
    "    * **Date Data:** Date and sometimes time values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-1b SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Query:** In SQL, covers both questions (data retrieval) and actions (data modification, object creation). \n",
    "* **`SELECT` Query:** The primary tool for data retrieval. Returns a set of rows similar to a relational table. \n",
    "* **Set-Oriented:** SQL commands typically operate over entire sets of rows and columns. \n",
    "* **`SELECT` Clauses (Building Blocks):** Specify *what* data, *how* to filter, aggregate, and display it. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-1c The Database Model\n",
    "\n",
    "* This chapter uses a sample database model (CUSTOMER, INVOICE, LINE, PRODUCT, VENDOR) to illustrate SQL commands. (See Figure 7.1 in the text). \n",
    "* **Business Rules (Examples):** \n",
    "    * A customer can have many invoices; each invoice belongs to one customer.\n",
    "    * An invoice contains one or more lines; each line belongs to one invoice.\n",
    "    * Each line references one product; a product can be on many lines.\n",
    "    * A vendor can supply many products; a product is supplied by only one vendor (or none).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7-2 Basic SELECT Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Core Clauses:** A `SELECT` query needs at least `SELECT` (columns) and `FROM` (table). \n",
    "* **`SELECT` Clause:** Specifies the attributes (columns) to return (Projection). Determines *which* columns and their *order*. \n",
    "* **`FROM` Clause:** Specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from. \n",
    "* **Other Clauses:** \n",
    "    * `WHERE`: Filters rows (Selection/Restriction).\n",
    "    * `GROUP BY`: Groups rows with matching values.\n",
    "    * `HAVING`: Filters groups.\n",
    "    * `ORDER BY`: Sorts the final result.\n",
    "* **Formatting:** Use separate lines and indentation for readability. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 7-3 SELECT Statement Options\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Basic Syntax:** \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT columnlist\n",
    "    FROM tablelist;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Selecting All Columns (`*`):** The asterisk wildcard retrieves all columns from the specified table. \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM PRODUCT; -- Returns all columns and rows from PRODUCT \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Selecting Specific Columns:** List column names separated by commas. The order in the list determines the output order. \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, P_QOH\n",
    "    FROM PRODUCT; -- Returns only specified columns \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-3a Using Column Aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alias:** An alternative name given to a column in the query output. Useful for clarity or renaming default/computed column headings. \n",
    "* **Syntax:** Use the `AS` keyword (optional but recommended) or just a space. Put aliases with spaces or special characters in delimiters (e.g., double quotes). \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        P_CODE,\n",
    "        P_DESCRIPT AS DESCRIPTION, -- Alias using AS\n",
    "        P_PRICE AS \"Unit Price\",   -- Alias with space (needs quotes)\n",
    "        P_QOH QTY                  -- Alias without AS\n",
    "    FROM PRODUCT;\n",
    "    -- Output columns: P_CODE, DESCRIPTION, Unit Price, QTY \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Delimiters:** Can control capitalization and allow special characters/keywords in aliases (generally discouraged). MySQL uses backticks (\\`) for aliases referenced elsewhere (e.g., `ORDER BY`). \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-3b Using Computed Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Computed/Calculated Column:** Represents a derived attribute calculated using formulas or expressions within the `SELECT` list. \n",
    "* **Example:** Calculate total inventory value. \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        P_DESCRIPT,\n",
    "        P_QOH,\n",
    "        P_PRICE,\n",
    "        P_QOH * P_PRICE -- Computed column \n",
    "    FROM PRODUCT;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Alias for Computed Columns:** Recommended for readability. Different DBMS have different default names (e.g., `Expr1` in Access, formula text in Oracle). \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        P_DESCRIPT,\n",
    "        P_QOH,\n",
    "        P_PRICE,\n",
    "        P_QOH * P_PRICE AS TOTVALUE -- Alias for computed column \n",
    "    FROM PRODUCT;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-3c Arithmetic Operators: The Rule of Precedence\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Operators:** SQL supports standard arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). \n",
    "* **Precedence:** Operations follow standard algebraic rules (parentheses first, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction). \n",
    "\n",
    "*(Sections 7-4 to 7-7e cover WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, Subqueries, Functions, and Basic Joins. Summaries would follow a similar pattern based on the text.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7-7 Joining Database Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "*(This section covers various ways to combine data from multiple tables)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Example: Old-Style Join - Generally Not Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Combines tables in the `FROM` clause and specifies join conditions in the `WHERE` clause. \n",
    "* **Potential Issues:** Mixes join logic with filtering logic, harder to maintain, susceptible to undetected errors if join conditions are missed. \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    -- Old-style join example\n",
    "    SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME\n",
    "    FROM PRODUCT, VENDOR -- Tables listed in FROM\n",
    "    WHERE PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE; -- Join condition in WHERE \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Example: JOIN ON Syntax - Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keeps join logic clearly within the `FROM` clause. \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    -- Recommended JOIN ON syntax\n",
    "    SELECT P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME\n",
    "    FROM PRODUCT JOIN VENDOR ON PRODUCT.V_CODE = VENDOR.V_CODE;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-7f Outer Joins *(Optional)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** Returns rows matching the join condition *plus* rows from one table that don't have a match in the other. \n",
    "* **Types:** \n",
    "    * **LEFT OUTER JOIN:** Returns all rows from the *left* table and matched rows from the *right* table. Unmatched right table columns get NULLs. \n",
    "        ```sql\n",
    "        -- List all vendors and their products, including vendors with no products\n",
    "        SELECT P_CODE, VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME\n",
    "        FROM VENDOR LEFT JOIN PRODUCT ON VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE;\n",
    "        -- \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * **RIGHT OUTER JOIN:** Returns all rows from the *right* table and matched rows from the *left* table. Unmatched left table columns get NULLs. \n",
    "        ```sql\n",
    "        -- List all products and their vendors, including products with no vendor\n",
    "        SELECT P_CODE, VENDOR.V_CODE, V_NAME\n",
    "        FROM VENDOR RIGHT JOIN PRODUCT ON VENDOR.V_CODE = PRODUCT.V_CODE;\n",
    "        -- \n",
    "        ```\n",
    "    * **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Returns all rows from *both* tables, filling in NULLs for non-matching columns on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-7g Cross Joins *(Optional)*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** Returns the Cartesian product of two tables â€“ every row from the first table combined with every row from the second table. \n",
    "* **Syntax:**\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    -- Using CROSS JOIN keyword (Not supported by Access)\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM T1 CROSS JOIN T2;\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Using comma syntax (Supported by most DBMS)\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM T1, T2; -- \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "* **Caution:** Generates large result sets; rarely used except for specific scenarios like generating test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-7h Joining Tables with an Alias\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** Use aliases for table names to shorten them or improve readability, especially in complex queries or with long/cryptic table names. \n",
    "* **Syntax:** Define alias after the table name in the `FROM` clause ( `AS` keyword may be required/optional depending on DBMS). \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT P_DESCRIPT, P_PRICE, V_NAME, V_CONTACT\n",
    "    FROM PRODUCT P JOIN VENDOR V ON P.V_CODE = V.V_CODE;\n",
    "    -- P is alias for PRODUCT, V is alias for VENDOR \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7-7i Recursive Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Purpose:** Joining a table to itself, typically used with unary relationships (e.g., an employee table where employees have managers who are also employees). \n",
    "* **Requirement:** Requires table aliases to distinguish between the two instances of the same table in the join. \n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    -- Hypothetical example: Find employees and their managers\n",
    "    SELECT E.EMP_NAME, M.EMP_NAME AS MANAGER_NAME\n",
    "    FROM EMPLOYEE E JOIN EMPLOYEE M ON E.MANAGER_ID = M.EMP_ID;\n",
    "    -- E represents the employee role, M represents the manager role\n",
    "    ```\n",
