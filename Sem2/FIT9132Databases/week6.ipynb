    "### I. SQL Constraints: Ensuring Data Integrity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Importance:** Enforce business rules and maintain data accuracy and consistency within the database.\n",
    "* **Entity Integrity:** Ensures each row in a table is uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "    * **PRIMARY KEY Constraint:** Uniquely identifies each record in a table. Automatically enforces entity integrity.\n",
    "        * Specified in `CREATE TABLE` using `PRIMARY KEY (column_name)`.\n",
    "        * Can also be defined as a column constraint (e.g., `P_CODE VARCHAR2(10) PRIMARY KEY`).\n",
    "        * Oracle automatically names constraints if not explicitly named. **Best practice:** Assign meaningful names.\n",
    "* **Referential Integrity:** Maintains consistency across related tables.\n",
    "    * **FOREIGN KEY Constraint:** Establishes a link between columns in two tables (child table references the parent table).\n",
    "        * Specified in `CREATE TABLE` using `FOREIGN KEY (child_column) REFERENCES parent_table(parent_column)`.\n",
    "        * **ON UPDATE CASCADE:** Automatically propagates changes to the primary key in the parent table to the matching foreign key values in the child table (ANSI SQL standard, *not supported by Oracle*).\n",
    "        * **ON DELETE CASCADE:** Automatically deletes related rows in the child table when a row is deleted from the parent table (ANSI SQL standard). Recommended for weak entities.\n",
    "        * **ON DELETE SET NULL / ON UPDATE SET NULL:** Sets the foreign key value to NULL in the child table when the corresponding primary key is updated or deleted in the parent table (ANSI SQL standard, supported by Oracle and MySQL for `SET NULL`).\n",
    "        * **ON DELETE SET DEFAULT / ON UPDATE SET DEFAULT:** Sets the foreign key value to a default value in the child table (ANSI SQL standard).\n",
    "        * Default behavior upon deletion of a parent record is to restrict the deletion if child records exist.\n",
    "* **Other Constraints (ANSI SQL Standard):**\n",
    "    * **NOT NULL:** Ensures a column cannot contain NULL values.\n",
    "    * **UNIQUE:** Ensures all values in a column are distinct. Creates a unique index.\n",
    "    * **DEFAULT:** Assigns a default value to a column when a new row is inserted without a specified value.\n",
    "    * **CHECK:** Validates data against a specified condition when an attribute value is entered or modified.\n",
    "* **Constraint Definition Locations:**\n",
    "    * **Column Constraint:** Defined within the column definition. Applies only to that column.\n",
    "    * **Table Constraint:** Defined using the `CONSTRAINT` keyword, usually at the end of the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Can apply to one or more columns.\n",

    "    WHERE condition;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    * MS Access prompts for deletion if the table exists.\n",
    "    * SQL Server does not automatically offer to delete.\n",
    "* **Important Note:** Integrity rules (primary keys, foreign keys) are **not** automatically applied to the new table. These need to be defined using `ALTER TABLE`.\n"
