Converting gdp exports into csv file
```{r eval=FALSE}
# --- STEP 1: Read your Excel file ---
# Replace "your_file.xlsx" with the actual path to your Excel file
# Replace "Sheet1" with the name of the sheet containing your data if it's different
gdp_exports <- read_excel("data/gdp_exports.xlsx", sheet = "Data", skip = 3)
# print(gdp_exports)

# --- STEP 2: Identify the columns to pivot ---
# We need to identify the columns that represent the years.
# Assuming the year columns start from the 5th column (after country, code, indicator, indicator code)
year_cols <- names(gdp_exports)[5:ncol(gdp_exports)]

# --- STEP 3: Pivot the data to long format ---
gdp_exports_long <- gdp_exports %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = all_of(year_cols),
    names_to = "Year",
    values_to = "Export GDP Ratio"
  )

# --- STEP 4: Clean the 'year' column (optional but recommended) ---
# The 'year' column will initially contain the year as character.
# You might want to convert it to numeric.
gdp_exports_long <- gdp_exports_long %>%

# --- STEP 5: Arrange the columns in the desired order (optional) ---

    select('Country Name', 'Country Code', 'Year', 'Export GDP Ratio', 'Indicator Name', 'Indicator Code')

# --- STEP 6: View the resulting long format data ---

# --- STEP 7: Save the long format data to a new file (optional) ---
write_csv(gdp_exports_long, "data/gdp_exports_long.csv")
