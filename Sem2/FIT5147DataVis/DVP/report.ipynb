    "1. Identify which findings from your Data Exploration Project you wish to communicate. You can be selective, and you do not need to share everything you have found. The visualisations and accompanying narration should reflect the answers to (one or more of) the questions in your Project Proposal.\n",
    "2. Clearly define your intended audience. The audience might be the elderly, young children, your classmates, the general public, politicians or whoever you like, although the choice should make sense for the data and topic of choice. Your subsequent interactive narrative visualisation submission should be designed specifically for the intended audience.\n",
    "3. Design an interactive narrative visualisation using the Five Design Sheet methodology.\n",
    "4. Prepare a short presentation based on your five design sheets (one sheet per slide).\n",
    "5. Attach 5DS as appendix\n",
    "7. Implement your visualisation using either R (Shiny) or JavaScript (D3). The use of other visualisation libraries and packages is subject to approval by your Teaching Associate (see the section “Notes on Implementation”). Note that you are not allowed to use R Markdown.\n",
    "8. Write a report and export it to PDF.\n",
    "9. Submit your report and your source code (see the section “How to Submit”) at the start of the exam period."

This should briefly refer to each of your five design sheets (you must provide each of your 5 design sheets in the Appendix), and justify your design choices based on the theoretical content of the unit (throughout Weeks 1-12), for instance: identifying consistency in your design and interaction; choice of visualisation, choice of visual variables, reasons for a particular colour\n",
