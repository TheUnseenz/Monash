    "        Data Transformation (Optional but impactful): Calculate an \"Inequity Ratio\" – e.g., (Average death rate in Low-Income) / (Average death rate in High-Income). A single, large number can be very effective.\n",

    "            Alternative (Given 2019 plastic data): The narrative needs to be precise: \"Countries like China and India, which saw significant increases in their share of global GDP between 2019 and 2023, were already the largest contributors to mismanaged plastic waste in 2019. This highlights a critical challenge: if rapid economic growth is not decoupled from waste generation, the problem of plastic pollution will escalate dramatically.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "    Finding A (Old 1 & 2): Lower-income countries face vastly higher air pollution death rates, despite a general trend of higher national GDP correlating with lower death rates. (Focus on the disparity and the general trend).\n",
    "    Finding B (Old 3): Certain regions/countries (e.g., parts of Asia, the US) exhibit higher air pollution death rates than expected for their GDP, while others (e.g., parts of South America, Africa) show lower-than-expected rates. (Focus on outliers and regional patterns).\n",
    "    Finding C (Old 4): Mismanaged plastic waste is disproportionately attributed to certain countries, notably China and India, beyond what their GDP share alone would suggest. (Focus on specific country outliers for plastic).\n",
    "    Finding D (Old 5): Rapid growth in world GDP share, particularly in countries like China and India, is happening alongside their already massive contributions to mismanaged plastic waste (in 2019), indicating a critical challenge in decoupling growth from pollution. (Focus on the growth dynamic + existing pollution).\n",

    "            Overlay: On each country, a circle (proportional symbol) sized by its air pollution death rate. Or, use color intensity within the GDP bin color to show death rate.\n",

    "            Visual: A large bar (or treemap area) representing 100% of global air pollution deaths (from countries in your dataset). Segment this bar by income group, where the size of each segment is proportional to the total deaths from countries in that income group.\n",
    "            Annotation: Within or beside each segment, show the average death rate for that income group and the number/percentage of countries it represents.\n",

    "        \"Slope Chart\" or \"Bump Chart\" (if comparing ranks or change over a proxy):\n",
    "            Visual: If you could rank countries by GDP and by air pollution death rate, a slope chart could show how these rankings differ, particularly if you group lines by income. This might be better for showing discrepancy rather than just magnitude. Probably less direct for this finding.\n",

    "i have a data visualization project as based on the data exploration project attached. i want to present it with policymakers e.g. government agencies as an intended audience (it is actually a class on how to present a data science project). i want to create the visualizations with R. as this project will need to run on mac and i do not own a mac and do not want to deal with virtualizing one, i would like to keep it to simpler libraries like ggplot2, dpylr, shiny, leaflet (these were introduced in class itself, but if more are needed, keep them simpler with less dependencies). it has been mentioned in class that i should avoid Scatter plot, Box plot, Area graph, Normal distribution, and generally avoid statistics visualizations as \"non-tech people wouldn't understand these stuff\", and because they're too \"simple\" and \"not interesting or unique enough\", and where relevant, to use fancier visualizations like radar charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "i'd like help with brainstorming the visualizations to use for not just the final design, but also the 5 design sheets, so suggest me more visualization methods and suggest separately which ones to shortlist, so i can put the ones that didn't make the cut as my iterative design process. as the attached data exploration project was part 1, i need to do more than just show the charts attached there. i need to show more stuff i have done, whether interactivity, data transformations, or more novel ways to present my data story.\n",

    "the notable points i have identified to present are:\n",
    "1. low and lower-middle income groups have vastly higher air pollution death rates. there is a clear trend that higher gdp reduces air pollution death rates.\n",
    "2. visually on a map, asia and US have more than air pollution death rates than expected for their GDP, while south america and africa have less.\n",
    "3. mismanaged plastic waste is far more attributed to China and India than their GDP suggests.\n",
    "4. growth in world gdp share is extremely correlated with mismanaged plastic waste share, and a map visualization shows this is almost entirely China and to a lesser extent India.\n",
    "\n",
    "trade dynamics turned out to be almost negligible in impact, but they did put US and China as bigger having more pollution deaths than otherwise anticipated. china and india as outliers for plastic waste mismanagement stood so far out they eclipsed the entire pollution analysis, but otherwise brazil would be the next runner up.\n",
