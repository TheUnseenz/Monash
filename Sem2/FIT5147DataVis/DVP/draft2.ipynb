    "Finding A: Income Disparity in Air Pollution Deaths\n",
    "    Idea: A grouped Bar Chart showing the average age-standardized air pollution mortality rate for each World Bank income group (Low income, Lower middle income, Upper middle income, High income). \n",
    "    Segmented Bar Chart/Treemap: Excellent for showing the overall disparity in burden.\n",
    "    Interactive Choropleth Map with Proportional Symbols/Color Intensity: Strong contender, very visual for policymakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initial \"Rejected\" Ideas: Scatter plot (GDP vs. Death Rate), Box plot (Death Rate by Income Group).\n",
    "    Alternative Ideas for Design Sheets:\n",
    "        Interactive Choropleth Map with Categorical GDP Bins & Proportional Symbols (or Color Intensity):\n",
    "            Map: Countries colored by discrete GDP per capita bins (e.g., 4-5 categories like Low, Lower-Mid, Upper-Mid, High, Very High).\n",
    "            Overlay: On each country, a circle (proportional symbol) sized by its air pollution death rate. Or, use color intensity within the GDP bin color to show death rate.\n",
    "            Interactivity (Shiny): Click on a GDP bin in a legend to highlight those countries. Hover for details.\n",
    "            Pros: Geographic, shows both GDP level and death rate simultaneously. Proportional symbols are fairly intuitive.\n",
    "            Cons: Can get cluttered. Proportional symbols need careful scaling.\n",
    "        Segmented Bar Chart or Treemap Illustrating Global Burden:\n",
    "            Visual: A large bar (or treemap area) representing 100% of global air pollution deaths (from countries in your dataset). Segment this bar by income group, where the size of each segment is proportional to the total deaths from countries in that income group.\n",
    "            Annotation: Within or beside each segment, show the average death rate for that income group and the number/percentage of countries it represents.\n",
    "            Pros: Starkly shows the disproportionate burden. Treemaps can be visually engaging.\n",
    "            Cons: Loses country-specific detail.\n",
    "        \"Slope Chart\" or \"Bump Chart\" (if comparing ranks or change over a proxy):\n",
    "            Visual: If you could rank countries by GDP and by air pollution death rate, a slope chart could show how these rankings differ, particularly if you group lines by income. This might be better for showing discrepancy rather than just magnitude. Probably less direct for this finding.\n",
    "        Radar Chart (Challenging for this specific finding, but to meet \"novelty\"):\n",
    "            Visual: Each \"spoke\" could be an income group. The \"value\" along the spoke would be the average death rate. This would just create a shape showing higher values for lower income groups.\n",
    "            Alternative Radar: Each spoke is a different health/economic indicator, one of which is \"Air Pollution Death Rate.\" Then, you could show radar charts for an \"average Low-Income Country\" vs. an \"average High-Income Country.\"\n",
    "            Pros: Novelty.\n",
    "            Cons: Might be less intuitive for direct comparison of one variable across income groups. Needs careful design.\n",
    "        Density Plot by Income Group: \n",
    "            Instead of bars, you could show density plots of the air pollution death rates, separated or layered by income group. This would visually represent the distribution and concentration of death rates within each group. Caution: This might be too close to the \"statistics visualizations\" you want to avoid for policymakers.\n",
    "        Violin Plot: \n",
    "            Similar to a density plot, a violin plot shows the distribution of the data (death rates) for each income group. It can give a good sense of the spread and median. Caution: Also falls under the category of \"statistics visualizations.\"\n",
    "        Grouped Proportional Area Chart: \n",
    "            You could divide the total \"area\" representing all countries by income group, and then within each income group, subdivide the area based on categories of air pollution death rates (e.g., high, medium, low). The size of each sub-area would represent the proportion of countries in that income group falling into that death rate category. This might be complex to interpret.\n",

    "Finding B: Regional/National Outliers in Air Pollution Deaths (vs. GDP)\n",
    "           Geographical Distribution of Air Pollution Death Rate Residuals\n",
    "    Idea: A Choropleth Map showing the residuals of air pollution death rates (actual vs. expected based on GDP). Color intensity can represent the magnitude of the residual, with different colors for higher vs. lower than expected rates.\n",
    "    Interactive Choropleth Map of Residuals: This is still the strongest, most direct way to show this finding visually.\n",
    "    \"Performance Gap\" Bar Chart: Excellent for focusing on specific regions/countries you mentioned (US, Asia vs SA, Africa) as a summary or drill-down.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initial \"Rejected\" Ideas: Scatter plot of residuals.\n",
    "    Alternative Ideas for Design Sheets:\n",
    "        Interactive Choropleth Map of Residuals (Map 1c):\n",
    "            Visual: As previously discussed â€“ countries colored by whether their death rate is higher (e.g., shades of red/orange) or lower (e.g., shades of blue/purple) than expected for their GDP.\n",
    "            Interactivity (Shiny): Hover to see country, actual death rate, predicted death rate (from your lm model: predict(model_mortality_gdp, newdata = country_data)), and the residual value. Add filters for continents.\n",
    "            Pros: Directly shows outliers geographically. Powerful for policymakers. The \"expected value\" concept can be explained.\n",
    "            Cons: Explaining \"residuals\" simply but accurately is key.\n",
    "        \"Performance Gap\" Bar Chart:\n",
    "            Visual: For selected countries or for regional averages (Asia, US, SA, Africa), show two bars side-by-side: one for \"Actual Death Rate\" and one for \"GDP-Predicted Death Rate.\" The gap is the residual.\n",
    "            Color-coding: Color the \"Actual\" bar red if it's higher than predicted, blue if lower.\n",
    "            Pros: Very clear comparison for specific entities.\n",
    "            Cons: Less of a global overview than the map.\n",
    "        Table with Conditional Formatting & Sparklines:\n",
    "            Visual: A table listing countries, their income group, actual death rate, predicted death rate, and residual. Use conditional formatting (color scales) on the residual column. Potentially add a \"sparkline\" bar in the residual column.\n",
    "            Interactivity (Shiny): Sortable, searchable table.\n",
    "            Pros: Precise data, good for detail-oriented users.\n",
    "            Cons: Less immediately \"visual\" or engaging than a map or chart for a high-level presentation.\n",
    "        Bubble Map with Residuals and GDP: \n",
    "            A Bubble Map where the location of the bubble is the country's capital (or centroid), the size of the bubble represents the absolute air pollution death rate, and the color represents the residual category (higher/lower than expected). This could quickly become cluttered in areas with many countries.\n",
    "        Dot Map with Color and Size Encoding: \n",
    "            A Dot Map where each dot is a country, the color indicates the residual (higher/lower than expected), and the size is proportional to population or GDP. Similar to the bubble map, this could be visually overwhelming.\n",

    "Finding C: Plastic Waste Outliers (China, India vs. GDP)\n",
    "           Mismanaged Plastic Waste Share by Country\n",
    "    Idea: A Treemap or Circle Packing chart where each rectangle or circle represents a country, and its size is proportional to its share of global mismanaged plastic waste. You can color-code the shapes by income group or continent. \n",
    "    Proportional Symbol Map (Plastic Waste) with GDP Color Overlay: Good balance of geographic info and direct comparison.\n",
    "    \"Discrepancy Index\" (Ratio) visualized as a Bar Chart or a simple Choropleth: Very direct in highlighting the key finding.\n",

    "            Annotation: China and India will have very large circles on moderately colored land areas, showing the disparity.\n",
    "            Interactivity (Shiny): Hover for details. Click a country to see its stats in a side panel.\n",
    "            Pros: Geographic, visually compares two different metrics (size vs. color).\n",
    "            Cons: Can get cluttered if too many countries have significant plastic waste.\n",
    "        \"Discrepancy Index\" Choropleth Map or Bar Chart:\n",
    "            Data Transformation: Create a new metric: PlasticWasteShare / GDP_Share_Ratio. A high value means much more plastic relative to economic size.\n",
    "            Map: Color countries by this new ratio. China and India should stand out.\n",
    "            Bar Chart: Show top 10 countries by this ratio.\n",
    "            Pros: Creates a single metric to highlight the discrepancy.\n",

    "        Packed Bubble Chart or Waffle Chart:\n",
    "            Packed Bubble: Each bubble is a country, sized by its mismanaged plastic waste share. Color the bubbles by GDP share (or income group). China and India will be huge bubbles.\n",
    "            Waffle Chart: A grid representing 100% of mismanaged plastic waste. Each square is a country, sized proportionally, or colored by country with major contributors taking many squares.\n",
    "            Pros: Visually engaging way to show proportions.\n",
    "            Cons: Loses geographic context. Packed bubbles can be hard to compare precise sizes.\n",
    "        Radar Chart (Country Comparison):\n",
    "            Visual: Select China, India, perhaps the US, Brazil, and an \"Average High GDP Country.\" Spokes could be: \"Share of Global Plastic Waste,\" \"Share of Global GDP,\" \"GDP per capita rank,\" \"Population Share.\"\n",
    "            Pros: Allows multi-dimensional comparison for specific countries, meets \"novelty.\"\n",
    "            Cons: Only works for a few selected entities. Interpretation needs guidance.\n",
    "        Radial Column Chart: \n",
    "            A Radial Column Chart showing the mismanaged plastic waste share for the top N countries. This presents the data in a circular format and can look visually distinct, though comparing the exact lengths of the bars can be harder than in a standard bar chart.\n",
    "        Pictogram Chart: \n",
    "            You could use a Pictogram Chart to represent the share of plastic waste for the top few countries, perhaps using icons representing waste or pollution. While visually engaging, it can be less precise for comparing values than other chart types.\n",
