    "- The interface mediates the interaction & dialog between people and the computer  \n",
    "    - Physically: e.g., pressing keys  \n",
    "    - Perceptually: what they can see, hear and touch  \n",
    "- Conceptually people interact with a system/devices through their mental model of the system  \n",
    "- Controls need to be obvious and understandable  \n",
    "- Information needs to be organised  \n",

    "Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design\n",
    "1. Strive for consistency  \n",
    "2. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts  \n",
    "3. Offer informative feedback  \n",
    "4. Design dialog to yield closure  \n",
    "5. Offer simple error handling  \n",
    "6. Permit easy reversal of actions  \n",
    "7. Support internal locus of control (support agency)  \n",
    "8. Reduce short-term memory load  \n",

    "Interaction supports the following user tasks:\n",
    "- Search/filter for elements satisfying some criteria  \n",
    "- Identify properties of a single data element  \n",
    "- Compare or rank items  \n",
    "- Visually identify patterns  \n",
    "- Calculate derived properties/analytics  \n",
    "- Building and running models  \n",
    "- Visualisation, configuring views  \n",

    "PACT (People, Activities, Context & Technology)  \n",
    "People: Involve end-users from the very start and really listen to them  \n",
    "Activities: Think about the goals, tasks and actions that the user has\n",
    "(visual tasks are important to take into account - see the next slides)  \n",
    "Context: Consider the environment, circumstances, social context,\n",

    "- Specify the data or view  \n",
    "    - Choose how to visualize  \n",
    "    - Filter to be specific to what you want  \n",
    "    - Sort data by some order based on desired pattern  \n",
    "    - Derive new insights by computing on the data  \n",
    "- Manipulate the view  \n",
    "    - Choose which to highlight, filter, manipulate  \n",
    "    - Navigate: go through high & low level details  \n",
    "    - Coordinate different views to link them  \n",
    "    - Organize multiple views  \n",
    "- Process the data & keep track  \n",
    "    - Record: the analysis histories  \n",
    "    - Annotate patterns to keep track of what you discover  \n",
    "    - Share views/annotations to collaborate with others  \n",
    "    - Guide users with analysis tasks or stories  \n"
