About the data:  
There are two dataset files used in this project containing attributes from the 
AusStage dataset that we have been using in the programming exercises throughout 
the unit. In this assignment, the data are in .json format and hosted on GitHub for 
you (you can see the data if you visit the url).  
 
The AusStage subset focuses on the collaborator involved in the most events, Kelley 
Abbey. We have already cleaned and transformed the data into the format you need. 
In wrangling the data we have removed duplicates, removed events not in Victoria 
and, if a collaborator has played various roles in different events, we have simplified 
this information to a single combined string property under “Role”, e.g., a collaborator 
may have been an Actor but also a Director.    
 
The two files contain the following attributes and example values. 
  
1)  event_contribution_network.json to create the “event contribution network 
diagram”. In this network, there are two types of nodes (indicated by the 
“type” property): ”event” and “contributor”:  
 
“nodes” contain the following properties, with an example: 
"id": "event_158557",  
"type": "event", 
"name": "Jesus Christ Superstar",  
"first_date": "2017-07-29", 
"last_date": "2017-08-13",  
"venue_id": "21",  
"venue_name": "The State Theatre", 
"suburb": "Melbourne" 
 
“edges”:  
     "source": "event_28513", 
      "target": "contributor_564388"   
 
2)  collaboration_network.json to create the “collaboration network diagram”. In 
this network, there are only “contributor” node types: 
 
“nodes”: 
"id": "contributor_1840", 
"type": "contributor", 
"name": "Eamon D'Arcy", 
"nationality": "Australian", 
"sex": "Male",  
"role": "Set Designer", 
"number_of_collaborators": 43 
“edges”: 
    "source": "contributor_3060", 
    "target": "contributor_4070", 
    "weight": 1
