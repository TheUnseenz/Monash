    "## Effective Communication\n",
    "When we communicate with each other, several assumptions are true for spoken language, written language, graphic novels, movies and sign language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relevance: The information that is provided is relevant to whatever is being discussed, and neither too much nor too little information will be provided.\n",
    "- Appropriate knowledge: We tailor the communication to the listener or reader, considering their knowledge and cultural expectations.\n",
    "- Directing and holding attention: The discussion is sequential, clearly indicating what is important and when there has been a change in topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paul Grice, a philosopher of language, in his Logic and conversation (Grice 2004) piece, proposed several 'conversational maxims':\n",
    "\n",
    "- maxim of quality – provide true information, do not say that which you know to be false or for which you lack sufficient evidence\n",
    "- maxim of quantity – provide enough information as is required but not more than is required\n",
    "- maxim of relevance – ensure that the information you provide is relevant\n",
    "- maxim of manner – avoid obscurity, and ambiguity, be brief and be orderly\n",
    "\n",
    "These points hold equally true for the visual language of data graphics. They mean:\n",
    "- be clear about what you are conveying\n",
    "- be clear who your intended audience is\n",
    "- show only what's relevant and choose visualizations your audience is familiar with and can understand\n",
    "- highlight what's important\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations, a mix of graphics and text is required in order to communicate more complex messages. Relevance, appropriate knowledge and narrative need to be considered for the overall mix, with clear visual signals guiding the reader on the most important elements and in what order to read them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing an effective data visualisation, it is crucial to consider the limitations of the human visual system and cognitive system discussed in The human visual system. In particular, you should choose visual variables and representations that facilitate\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discriminability: allow the reader to discriminate and compare data easily.\n",
    "- Perceptual organisation: encourage the perceptual system to group data in meaningful ways, such as by using Gestalt principles and different channels.\n",
    "- Compatibility: The conventions used are compatible with what they represent, e.g., use line graphs for continuous data, bar charts for discrete measurements and 'more' of a visual variable such as length means 'more' of the underlying quantity being conveyed.\n",
    "- Capacity limitations: take into account limitations in working memory and processing limits.\n"

    "## Narrative visualization structures\n",
    "### Visualization Genres\n",
    "Segel and Heer (2010) provide an overview of seven narrative visualisation genres: \n",
    "- magazine-style\n",
    "- annotated chart\n",
    "- partitioned poster \n",
    "- flow chart\n",
    "- comic strip \n",
    "- slide show \n",
    "- film/video/animation. \n",
    "\n",
    "These differ in the number of frames and the ordering of the frames. The genres can be combined. For instance, the Budget Forecasts example uses annotated graphs within a slide show format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Storytelling\n",
    "The ability to effectively communicate insights from a dataset using narrative and visualisation for a particular audience.  \n",
    "Media outlets often turn to data storytelling to help communicate data to their general audience. They often call it \"Data Journalism\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisation designers need to know and think about what effect the data story and narration should have on their audience. This effect can include sympathy or distaste, encouragement for action, information, explanation, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patterns and Groups of Narrative Storytelling\n",
    "Narrative can be grouped in 5 broader major pattern groups:\n",
    "- Argumentation, e.g., Repetition; \n",
    "- Flow, e.g., Gradual reveal;  \n",
    "- Framing, e.g., Incorporating the audience; \n",
    "- Emotion, e.g., Silent data; \n",
    "- Engagement, e.g. Call to action. \n",
    "\n",
    "Patterns of Narrative\n",
    "- **Incorporating the audience**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Empathy,  Engagement,  Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: The audience becomes part of the narrative.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Increases empathy and facilitates personal comparisons. Helps make the data and information more personally relevant.\n",
    "- **Breaking the 4th wall**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Empathy, Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: The subject unexpectedly addresses the viewer.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: To make a direct connection with viewer; to challenge the objectivity of the observation. To make it clear that this is one interpretation. It is a  surprise, making it attention-getting.\n",
    "- **Call to action**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Engagement\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Start with the presentation of a problem that needs solving or situation that needs changing. End with a call to action.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Provides motivation; offers outline for narrative; gives sense of purpose.\n",
    "- **Compare /Juxtaposition**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Showing two or more complementary visualisations side-by-side\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Compare cases or samples, allows to highlight contrast, difference, absence of difference, change over time. Allows for individual exploration of (minor) differences.\n",
    "- **Concretize**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Framing, Argument\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Use isotypes. Provide a known, concrete reference frame.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Make it easier to get a grasp on large, otherwise abstract numbers. To increase memorability.\n",
    "- **Convention breaking**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Use or establish a graphical convention, then break it.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: To engender surprise; to show extra-ordinary nature of data; to question the use of the convention; challenge assumptions.\n",
    "- **Defamiliarisation**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Embed the entry point of a narrative in an environment which the viewer is familiar with.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: To confront and challenge viewers’ expectations; to highlight and question implicit assumptions. To force thinking differently about a well-known case.\n",
    "- **Familiar Setting**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**:  Empathy, Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Present something known and familiar in a novel, unexpected way\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: To lower the entry barrier and make information personally relatable.\n",
    "- **Gradual visual reveal**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Flow\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Use visual hierarchy to control sequence of perception of individual elements.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Lets the story unfold in the viewer's mind while they read the graphic. Reveals the material in chunks to make it easier to absorb.\n",
    "- **Humans-behind-the-dots**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Empathy\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Show that there are concrete entities (e.g., a human being) behind or at the heart of the data.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Make abstract data more relatable, and possibly establish an emotional connection between the viewer and the fate of the entities.\n",
    "- **Make-a-guess**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Engagement, Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Enable the viewer to guess what insight they might find.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Stimulates the viewer's curiosity, and possibly leads to a game-lke experience. To engage the reader in causal reasoning about the phenomenon.\n",
    "- **Meaningful use of space / Use of Metaphor**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Use space and direction of movement to reinforce positive or negative feelings. Frequently, up = good; down = bad; left = retreat; right = progress\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: To support metaphor; to allow viewer to construct their own metaphor more easily; to take advantage of convention to ease understanding.\n",
    "- **Repetition**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Flow, Argument\n",
    "  - **How it works**: A phenomenon is re-presented multiple times with changes to the main variable/dimension (the data) or the time frame or the animation pattern (see the example) while other elements of the story don’t change.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: To show that the same phenomenon happens over and over again. It also strengthens the narrative through rhythm. Establishing a constant reference frame can help to emphasise change and differences.\n",
    "- **Rhetorical question**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Framing, Argument\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Title the piece using a question that makes a point.\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Implicitly drives the viewer to the takeaway of a more open-ended/exploratory piece.\n",
    "- **Silent data**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Framing\n",
    "  - **How it works**: The deliberate choice of not showing (hiding) certain data (like pauses in music?)\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: Emphasizing aspects by de-emphasising some data\n",
    "- **Speed-up/slow-down**\n",
    "  - **Groups of Patterns**: Flow\n",
    "  - **How it works**: Increase/decrease speed over time\n",
    "  - **Why it works**: To give the feeling of acceleration, increased momentum, urgency or the opposite. To surprise with change in perspective.\n",

    "## Animation, Interaction and Scrollytelling\n",
    "Animation isn't always better. At least for showing how mechanical devices work, snapshots of the key stages with careful annotations directing attention to changes and direction of movement work more effectively than animations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably because: \n",
    "1. the snapshots carefully direct and guide the reader's attention\n",
    "2. it is easy for the reader to compare different steps and to move backwards and forwards between these\n",
    "3. they encourage the viewer to 'mentally animate' components between the different steps which helps a deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, be careful when designing animations. They should:\n",
    "- Direct attention\n",
    "- Use visual continuity to help the reader preserve their mental map of the visualisation  \n",
    "- Stagger changes so that not everything changes at once  \n",
    "- Use carefully designed animations to show how the elements move. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple technique is to impose a linearity to the story. Vertically tall stories also impose a linearity, where the user scrolls down the content instead of pressing buttons.  This scrolling method has inspired its own new genre of narrative, often termed as “scrollytelling”, which has become very popular. Scrollytelling stories reveal new text as the reader scrolls, where the scroll often also triggers a change in the visualisation itself.  "
