Each shows a different aspect of the data and these are placed together in a large display. User interaction techniques such as brushing and filtering allow the viewer to understand how the data attributes in each chart are linked together. For instance, when the user hovers over a point in one chart, all elements corresponding to the same data point will be highlighted in the other charts.  \n",
