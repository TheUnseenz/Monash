You will need to report (i) what is your best model,  (ii) its accuracy on the test set, and (iii) the values of its hyperparameters. Note that you must report your best model's accuracy with rounding to 4 decimal places, i.e., 0.xxxx. You will also need to upload your best model (or provide us with the link to download your best model). The assessment will be based on your best model's accuracy, with up to 10 marks available, specifically:**\n",
