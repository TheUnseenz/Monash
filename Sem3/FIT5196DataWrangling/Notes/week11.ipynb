    "# Week 11: Data Validation âœ…\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is Data Validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data validation** is the process of ensuring the **accuracy, completeness, and reliability** of data before it's used for analysis or decision-making. The main goal is to verify that the data meets specific predefined criteria and standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a crucial step for:\n",
    "* **Maintaining data quality** by ensuring data is clean and useful.\n",
    "* **Preventing errors** that could lead to faulty decisions.\n",
    "* **Improving decision-making** by providing a foundation of high-quality, trustworthy data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Three Types of Data Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data validation can be broken down into three main categories, each checking a different aspect of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Structural Validation**: Checks if the data conforms to the required schema or model.\n",
    "2.  **Content Validation**: Focuses on the accuracy and relevance of the data's content.\n",
    "3.  **Logical Validation**: Ensures the data makes sense in its business context by checking it against business rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Structural Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structural validation** checks that data is organized and formatted correctly according to its specified structure. This is the first line of defense and is essential for automated processing and system integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Structural Validation Tasks\n",
    "* **Data Type Checks**: Ensures a field contains the correct data type (e.g., an integer, string, or date). For example, a `date` field shouldn't contain alphabetic characters.\n",
    "* **Format Checks**: Verifies that data follows a specific format, like a phone number (`(xxx) xxx-xxxx`) or an email address.\n",
    "* **Data Integrity Checks**: In relational databases, this ensures relationships are maintained, such as checking that a foreign key points to an existing record.\n",
    "* **Required Fields Check**: Confirms that mandatory fields are not empty or null.\n",
    "* **File Size and Type Validation**: Checks that uploaded files are of the expected type (e.g., `.csv`) and do not exceed size limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Online Retail Transactions\n",
    "Consider this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Customer\\_ID | Date\\_of\\_Purchase | Order\\_Amount | Product\\_ID | Customer\\_Email |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| 123 | 2023-08-15 | 59.99 | P001 | john.doe@example.com |\n",
    "| 124 | 15-08-2023 | 120.50 | P002 | jane.smith@example.com |\n",
    "| 125 | 2023-08-16 | -75.00 | P003 | adam\\_1@wrongformat |\n",
    "| 126 | not available | 99.99 | NULL | eve.williams@example.com |\n",
    "| | 2023-08-17 | 49.50 | P005 | mark.adams@example.com |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structural Errors Found:**\n",
    "* **Data Type Error**: The `Date_of_Purchase` for customer 126 is a string (\"not available\") instead of a date.\n",
    "* **Format Error**: The date for customer 124 (\"15-08-2023\") is in a different format than the others (\"YYYY-MM-DD\").\n",
    "* **Required Field Error**: The `Customer_ID` is missing in the last row.\n",
    "* **Integrity Error**: The `Product_ID` is NULL for customer 126, which might violate a foreign key constraint if every order must have a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Content Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "While structural validation checks the *shape* of the data, **content validation** checks the *substance*. It verifies that the data entries themselves are accurate, relevant, and correct for their intended use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Content Validation Tasks\n",
    "* **Range Checks**: Ensures data values fall within an acceptable range (e.g., an `age` field shouldn't have a negative number).\n",
    "* **Uniqueness Checks**: Verifies that values in a field required to be unique (like `Customer_ID` or `email`) are not duplicated.\n",
    "* **Referential Integrity**: Confirms that relationships between tables are consistent, like ensuring an `OrderID` in a `Shipments` table exists in the `Orders` table.\n",
    "* **List and Set Validation**: Checks if a value is one of a predefined set of options (e.g., a `Country` field must contain a valid country name from a standard list).\n",
    "* **Pattern Matching**: Uses techniques like regular expressions to validate complex formats, such as ensuring an email address is properly formed.\n",
    "* **Cross-Field Validation**: Applies rules that depend on multiple fields. For example, a `Delivery_Date` must be later than the `Order_Date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Online Retail Transactions (Revisited)\n",
    "Using the same dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content Errors Found:**\n",
    "* **Range Check Error**: The `Order_Amount` for customer 125 is negative (-75.00), which is likely invalid.\n",
    "* **Pattern Matching Error**: The `Customer_Email` for customer 125 (\"adam\\_1@wrongformat\") is not a valid email format.\n",
    "* **Uniqueness Check Error**: `Customer_ID` 126 appears twice, which might indicate a duplicate entry that needs to be resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Logical Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical validation** is the most advanced type, focusing on whether the data adheres to specific **business rules and logic**. It verifies the contextual correctness of data based on its relationship with other data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Logical Validation Tasks\n",
    "* **Consistency Checks**: Verifies that data across different fields is consistent with business rules (e.g., a patient's treatment is appropriate for their diagnosis).\n",
    "* **Sequential Validation**: Ensures data follows a logical sequence (e.g., a `Shipping_Date` must come after an `Order_Date`).\n",
    "* **Dependency Checks**: Validates data relationships (e.g., an employee's manager must hold a more senior position).\n",
    "* **Calculative Validation**: Checks that computed fields are derived correctly (e.g., `Total_Price` = `Unit_Price` * `Quantity` + `Tax`).\n",
    "* **Conditional Validation**: Applies rules that are only triggered under specific conditions (e.g., a \"senior discount\" is only applied if the customer's age is over 65).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Employee Timesheets\n",
    "Consider this employee timesheet data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Employee\\_ID | Date | Hours\\_Worked | Hourly\\_Rate | Department |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| 1001 | 2023-09-01 | 8 | 25 | HR |\n",
    "| 1002 | 2023-09-01 | 9 | 30 | IT |\n",
    "| 1003 | 2023-09-01 | 15 | 22 | Finance |\n",
    "| 1004 | 2023-09-01 | **25** | 28 | Operations |\n",
    "| 1005 | 2023-09-01 | 7 | **45** | HR |\n",
    "| 1006 | 2023-09-01 | 12 | **120** | IT |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logical Errors Found:**\n",
    "* **Consistency Error**: Employee 1004 worked **25 hours** in a single day, which violates the business rule that daily hours cannot exceed 24.\n",
    "* **Consistency Error**: Employee 1006 in the IT department has an `Hourly_Rate` of **$120**, while employee 1002 in the same department has a rate of $30. This might be a logical error if there's a business rule defining a much narrower pay band for that role.\n",
    "* **Consistency Error**: Employee 1005 in HR has an `Hourly_Rate` of **$45**, which is significantly higher than employee 1001 ($25) in the same department. This could be a logical error or require further investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Once validation rules detect an error, you need a plan to manage it. **Error handling** provides strategies to manage and resolve errors found during data processing. An effective strategy not only fixes current errors but also helps prevent future ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process generally involves:\n",
    "1.  **Detection**: Identifying the error.\n",
    "2.  **Reporting**: Logging the error with clear details.\n",
    "3.  **Assessment**: Understanding the error's impact.\n",
    "4.  **Response & Resolution**: Taking action to correct the error (e.g., fix, flag, or reject the data).\n",
    "5.  **Documentation & Review**: Recording the resolution.\n",
    "6.  **Prevention**: Implementing measures to stop the error from happening again."
