    "## Week 3a & 3b – Parallel Join & Parallel Outer Join\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Revision\n",
    "- **Inter-query parallelism**: Multiple different queries run at the same time.\n",
    "- **Intra-query parallelism**: Single query runs in parallel across multiple processors.\n",
    "- **Hash data partitioning + discrete range search** → only selected processors are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Join Operations\n",
    "- Links two tables based on matching attributes.\n",
    "- **Types**:\n",
    "  - **Inner Join** – only matching records.\n",
    "  - **Outer Join** – matching + unmatched records from one/both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Serial Join Algorithms\n",
    "1. **Nested-Loop Join**  \n",
    "   For each record in R, scan all records in S.\n",
    "2. **Sort-Merge Join**  \n",
    "   Sort both tables by join attribute(s), then merge.\n",
    "3. **Hash-Based Join**  \n",
    "   Hash R and S into buckets using same hash function, then join matching buckets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Parallel Join Algorithms\n",
    "- Achieved via **data parallelism**.\n",
    "- Two stages:\n",
    "  1. **Data Partitioning**\n",
    "  2. **Local Join** (using any serial join algorithm)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Data Partitioning Methods\n",
    "1. **Divide & Broadcast**\n",
    "   - Divide one table into disjoint partitions (equal partitioning).\n",
    "   - Broadcast the other table to all processors.\n",
    "   - Best to **broadcast smaller table**.\n",
    "   - No load imbalance, but heavy broadcast cost.\n",
    "   - In shared-memory: no table replication, but may run into memory limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Disjoint Partitioning**\n",
    "   - Partition both tables by **range** or **hash**.\n",
    "   - Each processor gets only relevant fragments.\n",
    "   - Potential load imbalance due to **data skew**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 5. Cost Models for Parallel Join\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Divide & Broadcast\n",
    "**Phases**:\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**  \n",
    "   - **Scan cost**: `(Si / P) × IO`\n",
    "   - **Select cost**: `|Si| × (tr + tw)`\n",
    "2. **Data Broadcasting**  \n",
    "   - Transfer cost: `(Si / P) × (N - 1) × (mp + ml)`\n",
    "   - Receive cost: `(S/P – Si/P) × mp`\n",
    "3. **Data Storing**  \n",
    "   - Store cost: `(S/P – Si/P) × IO`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.2 Local Join (Hash-Based Example)\n",
    "- **Phase 1: Loading**  \n",
    "  - Scan cost: `((Ri / P) + (S / P)) × IO`  \n",
    "  - Select cost: `(|Ri| + |S|) × (tr + tw)`\n",
    "- **Phase 2: Join Processing**  \n",
    "  - Join cost: `(|Ri| × (tr + th) + |S| × (tr + th + tj))`\n",
    "  - Overflow buckets cost:  \n",
    "    `(1 - min(H/|Ri|, 1)) × (Ri / P) × 2 × IO`\n",
    "- **Phase 3: Storing Results**  \n",
    "  - Generate result cost: `|Ri| × σj × |S| × tw`\n",
    "  - Disk store cost: `(πR × |Ri| × σj × πS × |S| / P) × IO`\n",

    "## 6. Parallel Join Optimization\n",
    "- **Main memory optimization**: avoid writing to disk between distribution & local join if possible.\n",
    "- **Load balancing**: more fragments than processors → rearrange to avoid skew.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Parallel Outer Join Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.1 ROJA (Redistribution Outer Join Algorithm)\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Redistribute both R and S on join attribute.\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Local outer join.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Simple, fast (2 steps).\n",
    "- **Cons**: Data skew, high communication cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2 DOJA (Duplication Outer Join Algorithm)\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Replicate small table.\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Local inner join.\n",
    "- **Step 3**: Redistribute inner join results by attribute X.\n",
    "- **Step 4**: Local outer join.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Expensive if \"small\" table is still large.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 DER (Duplication & Efficient Redistribution)\n",
    "- **Step 1**: Broadcast left table.\n",
    "- **Step 2**: Local inner join.\n",
    "- **Step 3**: Identify ROW IDs with no matches.\n",
    "- **Step 4**: Redistribute only ROW IDs (not full rows).\n",
    "- **Step 5**: Replicate ROW IDs.\n",
    "- **Step 6**: Inner join with replicated data.\n",
    "- **Pros**: Reduces data transfer compared to DOJA.\n",
    "- **Cons**: Still has replication costs for large tables.\n",

    "## 8. Load Balancing in Outer Joins\n",
    "- **OJSO (Outer Join Skew Optimization)**:\n",
