    "# 1. Producing the data  \n",
    "In this task, we will implement Apache Kafka producers to simulate real-time data streaming. Spark and parallel data processing should not be used in this section, as we are simulating sensors that often lack processing capabilities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tEvery 5 seconds, load 5 days of weather data from the CSV file. We refer to this as weather5s to explain the tasks; feel free to use your own variable name. You should keep a pointer in the file reading process and advance it per read. The data reading should be in chronological order.\n",
    "2.\tAdd the current timestamp (weather_ts) to the weather5s and spread your batch out evenly for 5 seconds for each day. Since the weather data is hourly readings, each day you shall have 24 records (120 records in total for 5 days).\n",
    "For example, assume you send the records at 2025-01-26 00:00:00 (ISO format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) -> (ts = 1737810000):  \n",
    "Day 1(records 1-24): ts = 1737810000  \n",
