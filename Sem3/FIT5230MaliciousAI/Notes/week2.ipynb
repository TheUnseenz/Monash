    "## 1. Foundations of Adversarial AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benign vs. Adversarial Contexts\n",
    "To understand adversarial attacks, we must distinguish between normal operations and malicious interference .\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Benign Setting**: In a standard AI environment, errors occur randomly. For example, a model might misclassify an image due to noise or poor lighting, but these errors are not systematic. The samples are \"correct\" or have random deviations.\n",
    "* **Adversarial Setting**: Here, samples are **intentionally corrupted** by an adversary. The goal is to bias the learning outcome or force a specific error. Crucially, these corruptions are often designed to be **undetectable** or \"innocent-looking\" to humans (e.g., imperceptible noise) while being catastrophic for the AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Perspective**:\n",
    "An adversarial attack is fundamentally an attack on the **Integrity (INT)** property of the AI system.\n",
    "* **The Means**: Modifying samples (attacking the data's integrity).\n",
    "* **The End Goal**: Changing the learning outcome (attacking the decision's integrity).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Machine Learning & Mathematical Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "To grasp how attacks work, we need to revisit the underlying math of ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Types\n",
    "* **Supervised Learning**: The model learns a mapping $f: X \\rightarrow Y$ from labeled samples $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}$.\n",
    "    * **Classification**: Predicts a discrete class (e.g., City vs. Rural).\n",
    "    * **Regression**: Predicts a continuous value (e.g., Weight based on Height).\n",
    "* **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds patterns in unlabeled data $\\{x_i\\}$, such as **Clustering** (partitioning data into subsets to minimize distance to centroids) .\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss Functions (The Target of Attacks)\n",
    "Attacks often involve maximizing the loss function that the model tries to minimize. Common loss functions include :\n",
    "* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: $MSE = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$\n",
    "* **Cross Entropy**: $-\\sum_i y_i \\log(\\hat{y}_i)$ (Used for classification).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradients and Derivatives\n",
    "Gradients are the compass for both training models and attacking them.\n",
    "* **Gradient ($\\nabla f$)**: A vector containing partial derivatives $(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y})$. It points in the direction of the **steepest ascent** (greatest increase) of the function $f$.\n",
    "* **Steepest Descent**: Conversely, $-\\nabla f$ points in the direction of the greatest decrease. Models train by moving in this direction to minimize loss. Attackers move in the *opposite* (positive gradient) direction to maximize loss .\n",

    "## 3. Classifying Adversarial Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "Attacks are categorized based on knowledge, goals, and timing .\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Type | Description | Example |\n",
    "| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
    "| **Knowledge** | **White-box** | Attacker has full access to the model (architecture, weights, gradients). | Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) |\n",
    "| | **Black-box** | Attacker only has query access (can see inputs and outputs). | Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO) |\n",
    "| **Goal** | **Targeted** | Force the model to predict a specific wrong class. | Cat $\\rightarrow$ Dog |\n",
    "| | **Untargeted** | Force the model to predict *any* wrong class. | Cat $\\rightarrow$ Not Cat |\n",
    "| **Timing** | **Poisoning** | Corrupting the training data to implant bias or backdoors. | Biased hiring algorithm |\n",
    "| | **Evasion** | Manipulating input data at test time to cause errors. | Adversarial stop signs |\n",

    "## 4. Specific Attack Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Semantic Adversarial Attacks\n",
    "These attacks exploit the way Deep Learning (DL) models \"memorize\" textures rather than understanding structure.\n",
    "* **Concept**: The input is semantically the same to a human but structurally different in a way the model cannot handle.\n",
    "* **Example (Negative Images)**: A negative image shares the exact same structure and semantics as the original. Humans classify it easily. However, CNNs often fail because the pixel value distribution is reversed (e.g., $0 \\rightarrow 255$), pushing the image **Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)** for the model .\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Noise Attack\n",
    "* **Type**: Naive, Untargeted, Black-box.\n",
    "* **Mechanism**: Simply adding random noise to an image until the classification changes. It is untargeted because it doesn't aim for a specific outcome, just an error .\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)\n",
    "A fast, efficient **white-box** attack that shifts the input image in the direction that maximizes the loss .\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Equation**:\n",
    "$$x' = x + \\epsilon \\cdot \\text{sign}(\\nabla_x J(\\theta, x, y))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Breakdown**:\n",
    "* **$x'$**: The adversarial image.\n",
    "* **$x$**: The original input image.\n",
    "* **$J(\\theta, x, y)$**: The loss function of the model.\n",
    "* **$\\nabla_x$**: The gradient of the loss *with respect to the input image* $x$ (not the weights). We want to know how to change the *pixels* to increase error.\n",
    "* **$\\text{sign}(\\cdot)$**: We take the sign ($+1$ or $-1$) of the gradient. This ensures we make a maximum change in the correct direction for every pixel, regardless of the gradient's magnitude.\n",
    "* **$\\epsilon$ (Epsilon)**: A multiplier (learning rate) that controls the magnitude of the perturbation. It ensures the noise is small enough to be invisible to humans but significant enough to fool the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Fast Gradient Value (FGV)\n",
    "A variation of FGSM .\n",
    "**The Equation**:\n",
    "$$x' = x + \\epsilon \\cdot \\nabla_x J(\\theta, x, y)$$\n",
    "**Difference**: Instead of using the `sign` of the gradient, FGV adds the **raw gradient value** directly. This scales the perturbation based on how sensitive each pixel is (pixels with higher gradients get larger changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO)\n",
    "A **black-box** attack for when gradients are unavailable (e.g., attacking an API) .\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mechanism**:\n",
    "Since the attacker cannot calculate the gradient $\\nabla f$ directly, they **estimate** it using the outputs of the model. They query the model with slight variations of the input and measure how the confidence scores change.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approximation Equation (Finite Difference)**:\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\nabla}_i f(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + \\delta e_i) - f(x - \\delta e_i)}{2\\delta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Breakdown**:\n",
    "* **$\\hat{\\nabla}_i f(x)$**: The estimated gradient for the $i$-th pixel.\n",
    "* **$\\delta$**: A very small constant (the perturbation size for estimation).\n",
    "* **$e_i$**: A standard basis vector (modifying only the $i$-th pixel).\n",
    "* **Logic**: By checking the model's output $f(x)$ when a pixel is slightly increased ($+\\delta$) versus slightly decreased ($-\\delta$), the attacker can estimate the slope (gradient) at that point without knowing the model's internals. This estimated gradient is then used to craft the attack."
