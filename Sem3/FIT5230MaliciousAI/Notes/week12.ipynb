    "# Week 12 - AI Governance\n",
    "\n",
    "1. AI is a category label, not a single tech. Effective AI governance needs to be nuanced.  \n",
    "2. Effective AI governance is dynamic. It'll require interactive refinement as adoption, risks, and technologies evolve.  \n",
    "3. Neither law, philosophy, policy, nor engineering can figure AI governance out alone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unclear what risks governments are regulating against e.g. compute thresholds =/= capability of model  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Realities of AI Governance  \n",
    "Trust is your #1 currency; the earlier you can build it,, the better (also: horizontal vs vertical networking)  \n",
    "Horizontal (fellow colleagues) often more helpful than vertical (seniors/juniors)  \n",
    "Create win-win situations  \n",
    "Treat everyone as a stakeholder  \n",
    "There's a lot of uncertainty to be handled, mistakes will be made, everyone would make mistakes.  \n",
    "Things will heat up; don't get angry with people doing their roles  \n",
    "At best, everyone will be equally unhappy  \n",
    "Make sure you get your contact available to the right people (journalists here)  \n",
    "There's communicated red lines and there's actual red lines  \n",
    "Optics matter, make presentation good  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Q&A\n",
    "AI governance is really slow and there's a lot of inertia  \n",
    "Try to convert your research into a 2-page policy brief  \n",
    "Enforcement depends on political will  \n",
    "With much of the world saying things are overregulated, political will for enforcement is difficult  \n",
    "Liability is difficult to pin on the user level  \n",
    "Right now we don't even have the technical means to trace back which models were used  \n",
    "We need more governance initiatives to try  \n",
    "Most likely the big names will be regulated and every other smaller ones will go under the radar...  \n",
    "(although the smaller companies will likely just shut down if they are hit as the fines can be a lot)  \n",
    "Transparency is the most important to enforce  "
